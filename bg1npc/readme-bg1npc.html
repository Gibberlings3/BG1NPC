<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This mod expands on the depth of character and levels of interaction with the BioWare NPCs from the BG game. When BG2 was released, one of the major improvements in many peoples' eyes was the increased level of interaction one could have with the party members. This mod was developed to allow BG players a similar experience. NPCs in your party now have banters with the PC, with each other, and small side-quests of their own. As we were unable to get the original character voice actors to voice all the new lines, we instead sought out music appropriate to each NPC to be played whenever they initiate banter. This musical package is a separate, optional package (to keep the download size down) titled <em>The BG1NPC Music Pack</em>. For link see below.</p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>

<p>The BG1 NPC Project is compatible with Tutu (v4 or EasyTutu), BGT, and Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition (with or without Siege of Dragonspear), and EET.</p>

<p>BG1NPC uses WeiDU for mod installation. The Windows and Mac packages ship with WeiDU v246.</p>

<p>BG1NPC is not currently compatible with Tutu v5 or v6. It might install, but is guaranteed to behave incorrectly. Don't say we didn't warn you. If you have legacy copies of these rebuilds, don't use them - Easytutu and Tutu v4 are the last confirmed workable platforms.</p>

<p>Sword Coast Stratagems, EasyTutu, BGT, BG1NPC, and BG Unfinished Business have made special efforts to make sure players can use these mods together without conflict. In addition, we have adapted our code to allow concurrent use of Sirene's Call. To play BG1NPC together with BGQE component "Brage's Sword" or Brage's Redemption Mod, the BGQE component "Brage's Sword" has to be installed before BG1NPC. With this, Brage's Redemption can be installed later. Without BGQE, Brage's Redemption should be installed before BG1NPC. Please visit the forums for more information, especially on install order.</p>

<p>A discussion of install order and a list of compatible mods for Tutu can be found in <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=8122">The Tutu State of the Modding Union</a> at the Gibberlings Three.</p>

<p>For BGT, a discussion of install order and a list of compatible mods can be found by checking <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/index.php?showtopic=19539">Spellhold Studios forums: compatibility</a> and looking for specific install order recommendations elsewhere on the forums, notably <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/index.php?showforum=193">Mega Mod Help</a> and projects like BiG World Project (BWP). Even if you are not playing a Mega Mod install, these are the places where people have experimented with install orders using BG1NPC on BGT games.</p>

<p>For BGEE, a list of compatible mods can be found by checking <a href="http://forum.baldursgate.com/discussion/15380/bg-ee-mods-and-modding-tutorials-quick-links/p1">mlnevese's list of BGEE Mods at the Baldur's Gate Forums</a> and looking for specific install order recommendations elsewhere on the forums.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG</h3>

<p>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must install a mod called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>The BG1NPC Project is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, extract the mod archive, and copy the "bg1npc" folder and setup-bg1npc.exe to your game folder (the folder which contains the CHITIN.KEY file). To install, simply double-click setup-bg1npc.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>

<p>Please run setup-bg1npc.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>

<h3>macOS</h3>

<p><em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the new version.</em> The BG1NPC Project is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, extract the mod archive, then copy the <em>contents</em> of the folder "OSX-bg1npc-v24" into your game folder (the folder which contains the CHITIN.KEY file). If properly extracted, you should have a "bg1npc" folder, setup-bg1npc, and setup-bg1npc.command in your game folder. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-bg1npc.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p><strong>For Tutu/BGT installs:</strong> Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux and extract (at least) the WeiDU, weinstall and tolower executables in a $PATH directory (e.g. /opt/bin). Following that, open a terminal, cd to your Tutu/BGT installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. After that, run 'weinstall bg1npc' from your game installation directory to install or uninstall the mod.</p>

<p><strong>For BGEE/EET installs:</strong> See <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/28516-the-linux-users-guide-to-installing-mods-on-the-enhanced-editions/">The Linux User's Guide to Installing Mods on the Enhanced Editions</a>.</p>

<h2>Components</h2>

<p>The BG1NPC Project contains 18 separate components that can be installed independently of one another.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the install, WeiDU will ask if you want to display four groups of components. If you wish to install or uninstall any of these components, reply "Y"; if not, the installer will allow you to skip ahead to the next section.</p>

<p>To uninstall BG1NPC completely, uninstall the component <strong>The BG1NPC Project: Required Modifications.</strong> The rest of the mod is dependent on that core component being installed, and will automatically de-install <strong>all</strong> of BG1NPC . To make sure the last elements are removed, delete the folder bg1npc and setup-bg1npc.exe from your installation directory.</p>

<p>If you wish to use only portraits or tweaks, you still must install this core repairs component.</p>

<h3>The BG1NPC Project: Required Modifications</h3>

<p>This component patches dialogue, creatures, scripts, adds or changes some items, fixes and alters some resources, and generally prepares for the rest of BG1NPC. It must be installed if you want to install any of the other components. The rest of the mod is dependent on that core component being installed, and uninstalling it will automatically de-install <strong>all</strong> of BG1NPC.</p>

<h3>The BG1NPC Project: Banters, Quests, and Interjections</h3>

<p>This component adds intra-party banters to BG NPCs. Each joinable NPC banters with every other joinable NPC and with the player character. It also adds interjections, scenery dialogue, encounters and quests for the NPCs. Kagain, Coran, Garrick, Kivan, Dynaheir, Xzar, Jaheira, Tiax, and Xan have custom personal quests. Additional small "Easter Egg" encounters are also included.</p>

<h3>The BG1NPC Project: Ajantis's Romance Core (teen content)</h3>

<p>This component will allow Ajantis to romance a Good or Lawful Neutral female PC. As of this version, you must choose your preferred timing for any romances you install; the standard speed is one hour, meaning that the minimum real time between romance lovetalks is one hour.</p>

<h3>The BG1NPC Project: Branwen's Romance Core (teen content)</h3>

<p>This component will allow Branwen to romance a male PC. As of this version, you must choose your preferred timing for any romances you install; the standard speed is one hour, meaning that the minimum real time between romance lovetalks is one hour.</p>

<h3>The BG1NPC Project: Coran's Romance Core (adult content)</h3>

<p>This component will allow Coran to romance a female PC of human or elven background; solving Coran's expanded quest will effect the development of the romance, as will the PC's reactions in dialogue. As of this version, you must choose your preferred timing for any romances you install; the standard speed is one hour, meaning that the minimum real time between romance lovetalks is one hour.</p>

<h3>The BG1NPC Project: Dynaheir's Romance Core (teen content)</h3>

<p>This component will allow Dynaheir to romance a male PC , and triggers an extension to Dynaheir's Quest. Please note that for BGT compatibility, the final set of cutscene encounters does not occur in the BGT version. As of this version, you must choose your preferred timing for any romances you install; the standard speed is one hour, meaning that the minimum real time between romance lovetalks is one hour.</p>

<h3>The BG1NPC Project: Shar-Teel Relationship Core (adult content)</h3>

<p>This component will allow Shar-Teel to romance a male PC. As of this version, you must choose your preferred timing for any romances you install; the standard speed is one hour, meaning that the minimum real time between romance lovetalks is one hour.</p>

<h3>The BG1NPC Project: Xan's Romance Core (teen content)</h3>

<p>This component will allow Xan to romance a female PC. As of this version, you must choose your preferred timing for any romances you install; the standard speed is one hour, meaning that the minimum real time between romance lovetalks is one hour.</p>

<h3>The BG1NPC Project: Female Romance Challenges, Ajantis vs. Xan vs. Coran</h3>

<p>This component expands the romance options and content for female characters being courted by Coran, Ajantis, and/or Xan. It only appears for female characters who have two or three of these NPCs in their party.</p>

<h3>The BG1NPC Project: NPCs Can Be Sent to Wait in an Inn</h3>

      <p>
        </strong> <em>not compatible with BGT. After being removed for v24, the component was restored for v29. It was not yet thoroughly tested for the EE v2.6 (BG:EE, BG:SoD, EET) and is in beta status.</em>
        <br/>
        This component allows BG NPCs to be sent to an Inn, another location, or to wait for you when you dismiss them from the party. This component is most likely not compatible with other mods that will make NPCs go to or wait at specific places, e.g. "BG NPCs go to inns" from Tweaks Anthology. Do not install mod components that conflict. In the BG1NPC version, slightly different waiting places are used, and NPCs will highly dislike being abandoned alone in dangerous areas...<br />
		NPC waiting locations:
        <ul>
		<li>Ajantis - Friendly Arm Inn or Elfsong Tavern
		<li>Alora - Friendly Arm Inn or Elfsong Tavern
		<li>Branwen - Friendly Arm Inn or Elfsong Tavern
		<li>Coran - Belching Dragon in Nashkel or Elfsong Tavern
		<li>Dynaheir/Minsc - Friendly Arm Inn or Elfsong Tavern
		<li>Edwin - Belching Dragon in Nashkel or Low Lantern
		<li>Eldoth/Skie - Feldpost's Inn or Elfsong Tavern
		<li>Faldorn - Cloakwood (what, you think she'd wait in an inn?)
		<li>Garrick - Friendly Arm Inn or Elfsong Tavern
		<li>Imoen - Friendly Arm Inn or Elfsong Tavern
        <li>Jaheria/Khalid - Friendly Arm Inn or Elfsong Tavern
		<li>Kagain - His store or Blusing Mermaid
		<li>Kivan - Friendly Arm Inn or Elfsong Tavern
		<li>Montaron/Xzar - Belching Dragon in Nashkel or Low Lantern
		<li>Quayle - Friendly Arm Inn or Elfsong Tavern
		<li>Safana - Belching Dragon in Nashkel or Elfsong Tavern
		<li>Shar-Teel - Belching Dragon in Nashkel or Blushing Mermaid
		<li>Viconia - A cave on the South Beregost Road or Blushing Mermaid
		<li>Xan - Friendly Arm Inn or Elfsong Tavern
		<li>Yeslick - Friendly Arm Inn or Elfsong Tavern
		</ul>
      </p>


<h3>Jason Compton's Accelerated Banter Script</h3>

<p><em>Tutu, BGT Only</em>
This component installs Jason Compton's Accelerated Banter Script, which basically makes banters happen more often. It is the same one as included with mods such as the Banter Packs for BG2, so if you have installed it there you don't need it again. Don't worry, the installer will tell you if you already have it installed.</p>

<h3>Banter Timing Tweak</h3>

<p><em>BGEE, EET Only</em>
This component utilizes the new BANTTIMG.2DA file available in BGEE to adjust banter dialog timings, allowing them to be accelerated <em>or</em> decelerated. This component supercedes Compton's Banter Accelerator script for BGEE. It is not available for Tutu/BGT (Compton's Banter Accelerator remains available for Tutu/BGT).</p>

<h3>The BG1NPC Project: Bardic Reputation Adjustment</h3>

<p>This component places three Bards in three inns scattered on the Sword Coast. Each can be hired to spread your fearsome reputation around, decreasing your reputation. The amount of money this costs is dependent on your current reputation. This allows players to manipulate reputation both upwards through temple donations, and downwards through the spread of rumors (for those of us who hate killing an innocent just to keep neutral NPCs happy).</p>

<h3>The BG1NPC Sarevok's Diary Adjustments</h3>

<p>This component installs either SixofSpades' Expanded Sarevok Diary, or the original BG1NPC Project version.</p>

<p>SixofSpades' Expanded Sarevok Diary adds content rationalizing in-game events as closely to the storyline as he could, and incorporates entries that give depth to roleplayers. It also sets the diary to a book instead of a scroll. It is more a comprehensive change than Unfinished Business.</p>

<p>BG1NPC's original version changes the dates in the diary to fit the BG storyline more closely. It is less agressive a change than Unfinished Business' version.</p>

<p>Not installing either means that you have the original diary, flagged as a scroll, with no content changes.</p>

<p>In order of extent of changes, from least to most, between BG1 Unfinished Business (BG1UB) and BG1NPC:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vanilla</li>
<li>"Slightly" restored (just correcting the dates) in BG1NPC regular</li>
<li>"Rationalized and Updated" in SixofSpades' BG1UB component</li>
<li>"Dates and characterizations and entries extended" in SixofSpades' BG1NPC component</li>
</ul>

<h3>The BG1 NPC Project: Kivan's Proficiency</h3>

<p>This component will give a choice to alter Kivan's weapon proficiency pips to either halberds or spears. This is interesting insofar, as the quest item Kivan receives from Thalatyr is a spear, whereas he comes with pips in halberd in BG:EE.</p>

<p>Option one: Kivan uses spears. This option will give Kivan 2 pips in spears, and also replace two halberds in teh game with spears (one in the cave in Dryad Falls, another in the Cloakwood Mines level 3.</p>

<p>Option two: Kivan uses halberds. This option will give Kivan 2 pips in halberds.</p>

<h3>The BG1NPC Project: Kivan's "Kivan and Deheriana Companions" Portrait</h3>

<p>This component will give Kivan his portrait from Domi's mod, for those wanting consitency for the entire saga.</p>

<h3>The BG1NPC Project: Coran's "Murder in Baldur's Gate" Portrait</h3>

<p>This component will give Coran his portrait from the D&amp;D PnP module "Murder in Baldurs' Gate".</p>

<h3>The BG1NPC Project: Add Portraits to BG1NPC Non-Joinable NPCs</h3>

<p>Installing this component assigns portraits to non-joinable NPCs added by BG1NPC. It is designed to be used in conjunction with a mod that assigns portraits to other non-joinable NPCs (e.g., <a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/61015/mod-portraits-portraits-everywhere-for-bg1ee-sod-bg2ee-iwdee-eet">Portraits Portraits Everywhere</a>).</p>

<h3>The BG1NPC Project: Add Non-Joinable NPC Portraits to Important NPCs (DEPRECATED)</h3>

<p>Installing this component gives some important non-joinable NPC portraits, such as Gorion, Angelo, Duke Eltan and Tazok. <em>This component is currently deprecated due to copyright issues.</em></p>

<h3>The BG1NPC Project: Player-Initiated Dialogues (PIDs)</h3>

<p>This component will give the player force-talk options for all party members. This will allow the PC to ask questions about an NPC and their past. To activate the PIDs, have your character talk to the NPC in question. Please note: the PID component must be installed after all other BG1NPC components. If you change an installation component involving dialogue, this component will automatically be uninstalled, and you may have to manually re-install it.</p>

<p><em>Tutu only</em>: This component also has a Player-initiated string-fixer for all BGNPCs. If an NPC is starting to say other character's lines, or sounds odd, then speak to the character and let them know that their voice "sounds strange". The PID string-fixer will re-map the voiced lines and responses for the character, allowing you to continue the game.</p>

<h2>Modder Notes</h2>

<p>The philosophy driving coding in this project is to preserve compatibility with as wide a range of platforms and mods as possible. The BG1NPC Project incorporates the following required core fixes to support Project code:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="bg1npc_docs/bg1npcvarindex.htm">Index of Variables used in The BG1NPCProject code, with file name and line number, sortable by column.</a></li>
<li>Use of <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/">Cross Platform Modding Variables</a> for single install code for multiple platforms</li>
<li>Use of Fluid State Variables for single install code for BGT compatible coding of joinable NPCs who stack BG dialogue on top of BG2 dialogue. This will be most useful when used in conjunction with versions of BGT v1.06 and above.</li>
<li>Non-destructive .tp2 patching of the pdialog.2da to incorporate Dream Scripts for all standard BioWare Non-Player-Characters</li>
<li>Non-destructive .tp2 patching of the interdia.2da to incorporate Imoen's banter file if not present</li>
<li>Non-destructive (installs if not present) initialization of bimoen.dlg/_bimoen.dlg</li>
<li>Non-destructive .tp2 patching of the happy.2da to allow CamDawg's Neutral/Happy interjection restoration</li>
<li>Tutu only: non-destructive .tp2 patching of the songlist.2da to allow music swapping</li>
<li>Clearing of repetition of default BioWare dialogues by ADD<em>STATE</em>TRIGGER and ADD<em>TRANS</em>ACTION to most files (c.f. files BG1NPC/Core/DLG/X#BGREPLACE<em>TUTU.D and BG1NPC/Core/DLG/X#BGREPLACE</em>BGT.D)</li>
<li>Tutu v4 and SoA-Only install support of cutspy.cre by creation of a working x#cutspy.cre</li>
<li>Creation and installation of Gorion's "talking letter" to force reading and variable setting on in-game receipt</li>
<li>Non-destructive patching of several NPCs to recheck that platform default override scripts and gnome animations are correct, and to force any .cre we use to effect v2 rather than v1</li>
<li>Inclusion of STATE.IDS patching to support CD<em>STATE</em>NOTVALID (courtesy of CamDawg)</li>
<li>ACTION.IDS, TRIGGER.IDS, GTIMES.IDS, and ANIMATE.IDS updated to Throne of Bhaal version (courtesy of BG2 Fixpack)</li>
<li>Tutu/BGT only: Cleaning Joined Files of non-conditional states using reversible non-attainable variables specific to the states in question, using a standardized format REPLACE<em>STATE</em>TRIGGER ~_AJANTJ~ 1 ~Global("X#JCleanAjantis","GLOBAL",1)~</li>
<li>Hijacking of Coran's Wyvern Timer and related dialogue via ~GlobalTimerExpired("Coran","GLOBAL")~ ~GlobalTimerExpired("Coran","GLOBAL") Global("X#CoranWyvernDisable","GLOBAL",1)~ and extension of his bcs.</li>
<li>Falsing of Kivan's and Minsc's standard timers in bcs, effectively removing any quest-time-related attempt to leave the party</li>
<li>Inclusion of a patching macro to convert Tutu items to BG2 items for BGT compatibility</li>
<li>Patching in all Tutu v4 Area Script name assignments for existing areas.</li>
<li>Area Type (FOREST, OUTDOOR, etc.) flagging patch for all areas</li>
<li>Tutu only: WizWom's NPC Battle fix, patching existing .bcs with REPLACE_TEXTUALLY ~MakeUnselectable(5000)~ ~MakeUnselectable(6) Continue()~</li>
<li>Miscellaneous non-destructive creature patching for all gnomes in the game, for animation, level, kit, etc.</li>
<li>In .DLG: Use of I<em>C</em>T with passback or I<em>C</em>T3 with passback for maximum compatibility with multiple interjections into the same state.</li>
<li>| TuTu | Variable | Associated | BGT |
| dream | %bgdreams% | player1d | BG1Dream |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | %bgdream1% | DRMTXT-2 has played | 1 |
| 3 | %bgdream2% | DRMTXT-3 has played | 2 |
| 4 | %bgdream3% | DRMTXT-4 has played | 3 |
| 5 | %bgdream4% | DRMTXT-5 has played | 4 |
| 6 | %bgdream5% | DRMTXT-6 has played | 5 |
| 7 | %bgdream6% | DRMTXT-7 has played | 6 |</li>
</ul>

<p>This list covers the required components. For compatibility notes on individually installed components, please evaluate the code directly, remembering that the files are often interlinked - so search carefully. While almost all Project code actively tries to avoid compatibility problems, two specific components do re-adjust major expected behaviors. ALORA being moved destructively overwrites a new pre-joining [_]ALORA.DLG, so if a mod has added to her pre-joined file those materials will be destroyed. KAGAIN's Caravan Quest shuts the variable "KagainCaravan" off and replaces it with a new expanded quest using "X#KagainCaravan".</p>

<p>As of September, 2011, none of the above items have shown incompatibility problems in testing with both Tutu and BGT standard mods installed in the recommended orders from the forums.</p>

<h2>Thanks and Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>It takes many people to contribute to a project as large as BG1NPC. The current list of folks who have contributed and we wish to thank is at our forum.</p>

<p>Thanks to Jason Compton for his help in spotting where Andyr messed up with the very first alpha, and for letting us use his accelerated banter script! Big thanks also to Amok for letting us use some fantastic artwork for a few of the portraits. For invaluable help and consistent patience teaching working with WeiDU , thanks to CamDawg, the bigg, Grim Squeaker, Smoketest, devSin, and Nythrun.

<li>Added code to update SPELDESC.2DA in BGEE for Camdawg's Temple Fix</li>
<li>For CREs that use BG2 sounds that are unavailable in BGEE, sound references were updated to sounds available in BGEE (with a few exceptions). Note: Tutu and BGT will still use available BG2 sounds.</li>
<li>Added x#ogref sounds for x#chop and x#cru in Xan's Turnip Quest.</li>
<li>Fixes for x#cutspy creating errors in BGEE.</li>

<li><p>Fix area scripts for AR2400 and AR2900 to not continuously fire when the variable TazokSays = 1. This was preventing blocks added by BG1NPC from firing.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated to WeiDU v237</p></li>
<li>German translation available (Teiluebersetzung vom Kerzenburgforum, teilweise noch in englisch, <a href="http://kerzenburg.baldurs-gate.eu/">http://kerzenburg.baldurs-gate.eu/</a>)</li>
<li>Polish translation available (Tlumaczenie przez Children of Bhaal, <a href="http://athkatla.cob-bg.pl/viewtopic.php?t=5734">http://athkatla.cob-bg.pl/viewtopic.php?t=5734</a>)</li>
<li>General coding updates to modern WeiDU standards (e.g., using GAME<em>IS instead FILE</em>EXISTS for game type checks)</li>
<li>Updated cross-platform libraries with latest fixes for all platforms. (Jastey)</li>
<li>New variable %tazokminhp% to account for different anti-death items used in Tutu vs. BGT vs BGEE.</li>
<li>New variable %RunAwayFrom% for scripts to use action "RunAwayFrom()" in Tutu/BGT and new action "RunAwayFromNoLeaveArea() in BGEE.</li>
<li>Move dialog changes for Coran Wyvern quest from x#jfix<em>X and x#bgreplace</em>X to new x#corwyv_X.d files.</li>
<li>Block Shar-Teel/Tiax banter until Chapter 4, since it references the Iron Throne.</li>
<li>BG1NPC romances won't start while CHARNAME is wearing the Girdle of Masculinity/Femininity for compatibility with BG1 Romantic Encounters mod.</li>
<li>Reordered dialog actions to place EscapeArea() command last.</li>
<li>Reordered Dynaheir, Branwen, Coran, Xan, and Shar-Teel dream script triggers to prevent crashes when NPC is dead while resting. (Jastey)</li>
<li>Ajantis Romance/SCS Wait at Inns component incompatibility fix.</li>
<li>Added macro ~source<em>cre</em>sound_cleanup~ to CRE blocks for cleanup.</li>
<li>Update Jozzi Seasnake (#seasn) to use Nereid soundset (all platforms).</li>
<li>Update x#garwyl to use GHAST sounds like a spectre (all platforms).</li>
<li>Imoen's dialog regarding Gorion's body no longer requires CHARNAME to be holding Gorion's letter. Her script triggers the dialog by the party picking up the letter, but in the time it takes her to walk to CHARNAME, it was possible to read and drop the letter, leaving her unable to initiate the proper dialog.</li>
<li>Imoen's dialog on Laryssa will no longer interrupt Brage's script to return the party to Nashkel.</li>
<li>At the Bandit Camp, if Tazok was engaged in combat too quickly, Kivan could be left trying to initiate dialog with him. This dialog would fire after the combat, with Tazok possibily dead. Kivan no longer attempts dialog with Tazok after Tazok is dead.</li>
<li>Updates for Tiax's Quest to close open quest entries at their conclusions.</li>
<li>Moved Minsc/Dynaheir interjection with Thalantyr into a new stand-along banter with Dynaheir</li>
<li>Xan's interjection with Mulahey was copying a "ChangeEnemyAlly(Myself,NEUTRAL)" command to Xan since there is no pass back. Changed to ICT2 to prevent issue.</li>
<li>Added checks to Imanel Silversword's script to prevent dialog from re-initiating and stop dialog from initiating during battle.</li>
<li>Montaron was being sent to Minsc's "goto" location in the Elfsong Tavern rather than the Low Lantern with Xzar by BG1NPC's Wait at Inns component. Updating to send Montaron to Low Lantern.</li>
<li>In Tutu, when refusing Cythandria's surrender, Dynaheir will turn hostile. Danaher's interjection is inheriting an Enemy() action from Cythandria. Only affects Tutu, Cythandria's dialogue state 6 has an "Enemy()" action which is not present in BG:EE and BGT. Solution is to remove the Enemy action() in Tutu.</li>
<li>Kivan gives his reaction to Prism's death upon entering the Nashkel Mines area even if he wasn't in the party when Prism died. Adding a See("prism") check to script block in kivan.bcs. That should prevent the trigger from firing long after Prism is dead (and the corpse is removed).</li>
<li>Safana's response to PID option "Do you have any advice, Safana?" References Narlen Darkwalk, even in Chapter 1. Corrected triggers to not show this response until after Narlen has been encountered.</li>
<li>Correcting "Bruno" DV in x#yeint2.baf. (MadMate)</li>
<li>Updated item slots for x#david and x#dragon to place items in correct slots. (MadMate)</li>
<li>The XZNI1.6 dialog in xzint.d has an issue with the conditions. If Montanan is in the party, alive, but disabled (e.g., held, panicked, etc..), the dialog cannot continue. Updating the second transition condition to be "OR(3) !InParty("montaron") !InMyArea("montaron") StateCheck("montaron",CD<em>STATE</em>NOTVALID)" which is the opposite of the first transition, ensuring one branch can fire.</li>
<li>Updates to Coran's Succubus Quest
<ul>
<li>Updates to close open quest journal entries at quest conclusion. Added "close quest" journal entries.</li>
<li>If you refuse the quest initially, Coran no longer becomes instantly "charmed" before he has been given the roses. He has a more appropriate reaction to your refusal of Amelia.</li>
<li>Scripting updates to account for players force-attacking Amelia. Amelia will now turn hostile and attack the party. If Natan has not been talked to, remove him if Amelia is force-attacked (quest is aborted). If Natan has been talked to, increment X#CoranSuccubus to 13 to allow quest to complete.</li>
<li>Coran will now become "charmed" by Amelia when in her presence if Natan is "charmed" (i.e., has been shown the roses).</li>
<li>Amelia was a very difficult battle for BG1, so she has been toned-down to be more appropriate for BG1.
<ul>
<li>HP, THAC0, AC, Saving throws updated to be in line with PnP succubus stats.</li>
<li>Only immune to non-magical weapons</li>
<li>On BGEE (or Tutu/BGT installs with 1PP Wings), Amelia's combat appearance now has wings (defaults to previous fire elemental appearance on installations without 1PP Wings).</li>
<li>Updated combat script, inspired by Kirinhale's from TotSC</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Many dialog typo fixes.</li>

<li>Miloch's Code Repairs: Added buggered Tutu soundslot fix, _zombiew.cre's race to zombie, Changed copied zombies' reaction from Enemy to Neutral (critical fix for Garrick's quest), macro<em>tutu</em>items<em>to</em>bgt.tph fixes adding a ton of items that weren't getting converted on BGT , unique portraits to Garrick's zombies, surgical spell/script fixes (required for Gnomes), removed redundant druid references assigned on CREs, and even more stuff.

</ul>

<p><strong>Version 12 Beta 3 - October 22, 2006</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Repairs to Jaheira commenting on Gorion before burial looping</li>

<li>WizWom's NPC Fight Fix tested, works great with Tutu; confirmed incompatable with BGT side</li>
<li>Created new optional component "Make Shar-Teel Unkillable"</li>
<li><acronym title="Death Variable">DV</acronym> repairs to Jaheira's Quest creatures</li>
<li>Repairs to Ajantis' <acronym title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</acronym> /Non-<acronym title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</acronym> compiled romance dialogues</li>
<li>Big Group Project Completed: all TRA files fully proofread and integrated; multiple repairs</li>

Still at Beta status for BGT , as we are occasionally running into <acronym title="Player-Initiated Dialogues">PID</acronym> conflicts with dialogues; the BGT side seems to have restored almost all of these always-true timered conditions, so I have to go fix them one by one. It installs, works better than the previous ones, and has taught me a lot, but still is definitely a Beta. Biggest single change from Beta 2 was the moving of a number of .cre and item creations to use existing creature files as templates, and the addition of a BGT -to-Tutu item macro</li>
