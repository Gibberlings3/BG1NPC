@1    = ~Mine foster father, Gorion, raised me with great care, Dynaheir. I have been educated in many fields, amongst which history was ever one of my favorites.~
@2    = ~History? What good is it for a man who is about to have his guts spilled or his throat cut?~
@3    = ~One can never have sufficient knowledge, Dynaheir. I have been taught by Candlekeep's librarians, and mayhaps, when this crazy race with death is done, I can return to my studies.~
@4    = ~I have learned enough to understand that I have no interest in the past.~
@5    = ~Do I know history? I can *teach* history, Dynaheir!~
@6    = ~I am quite pleased to hear that. Perhaps, thou would humor an old scholar with a discussion of things past, once we have a longer moment of quiet?~
@7    = ~'Twould be mine greatest pleasure, Dynaheir.~
@8    = ~Might I be allowed to say that although thou art a scholar, thou art in no way old. We need not be of an age for thee to treat me as an equal.~
@9    = ~Dynaheir... *sigh* Ever since I left Candlekeep, the present has been dragging me along like a rock caught by a flooding stream in the spring. I am afraid I have no energy left for witty disputes and intricate explorations into the Realms' past.~
@10   = ~I am not some fyrra for you to guide and educate!~
@11   = ~We can... but what's the point? Should we not better take care of our equipment or rest?~
@12   = ~Indeed, for the vanquished, no knowledge is required.~
@13   = ~The victor, on another hand doth require it.~
@14   = ~Victor? Dynaheir, thou speaketh of me in terms reserved for the great. I am but an orphan, trying to elude the fate of his unfortunate father.~
@15   = ~Ha-ha! Dynaheir, nothing can convince me that one needs to know what year Sembia was established as a sovereign country in order to stick the pointy end of a sword into a xvart's belly or squish a zombie into goo. And these are the kind of victories I-~
@16   = ~Victor? That has a pleasing ring to it. If you think that I need to banter of the deeds of those who perished ages ago to achieve a greater destiny... Well, you are the wise woman, after all. But you better be right, Hathran, for I dislike wasting my time.~
@17   = ~Grand words, but what use are the words in a yellowed manuscript to the victor?~
@18   = ~*quietly* <CHARNAME>, thou wilt never have a peaceful life again. Do not delude thyself. Thou must choose betwixt learning amidst worries and weariness and abandoning learning.~
@19   = ~*sadly* You just reminded me of Gorion... you have similar persistence and the same ability to dispute until you have proven yourself right. Not to mention the love of history.~
@20   = ~I can but try, Dynaheir. But do not say that I did not warn thee, were I to fall asleep in the middle of our conversation, when the weariness of the day catches up with me.~
@21   = ~*shrug* If thou wish. But I perceive it as a pointless occupation for a man who is about to have his guts spilled or his throat cut.~
@22   = ~Mayhap we can start with lighter historical topics, such as “The History of Lady Dynaheir”, for instance. 'Twill surely keep me awake.~
@23   = ~They say that all knowledge newly learned is but old knowledge well-forgotten. History hath many valuable lessons for those with a sharp mind.~
@24   = ~For a King or a General, perhaps. But I am a man of modest means and of unclear destiny.~
@25   = ~Thou art a wise woman, Dynaheir. We should exercise our minds then, just as we are honing our swords and keeping our supplies from rot.~
@26   = ~That does not convince me.~
@27   = ~Why don't you attempt to educate Kagain then, Dynaheir? Otherwise, the old dwarf is like to expire without learning these all-important things. I am too young for this!~
@28   = ~These art wise words. I am looking forward to our discourse.~
@29   = ~And so do I. *bow with a flourish to Dynaheir*~
@30   = ~It should prove an interesting pastime.~
@31   = ~If I may offer the topic of our first discourse... How about "The History of Lady Dynaheir"?~
@32   = ~And I am curious as to what consequences may arise from such a private counsel.~
@33   = ~If thou wishes. Indeed, thou art experiencing the world at a greater speed than the common man. One may even say that the world is in turn experiencing thee, quite rapidly.~
@34   = ~An acute observation, my lady Dynaheir. Talking to thee is always delightful, and it takes my mind off the dirt and blood and sweat of adventuring.~
@35   = ~Heh, the world should better brace itself, for I have come to put it into the pocket of my breeches.~
@36   = ~O Doomsayer, art thou always *that* fond of young orphans, or did I somehow distinguish myself, not knowing it?~
@37   = ~The hand of destiny moves me, I am sure of that. All these assassination attempts, the tasks that drop into my lap... saving damsels in distress from gnolls. Odd, that. Only a few weeks ago I did no more than dust old books and chat with the guards of Candlekeep!~
@38   = ~No, thou art not a fyrra. Not yet. But anyone can benefit from bandying words with the wise.~
@39   = ~Oh, beat it! We can talk about anything you want later, just leave me be for now.~
@40   = ~'Tis true. We shall talk of the past then, Dynaheir.~
@41   = ~Perhaps we could discuss a light historical topic, such as “The History of Lady Dynaheir”. 'Twill surely keep me awake.~
@42   = ~That does not convince me a single bit!~
@43   = ~Thou must be the only lad I know who dost not see himself as a great man in his dreams. Ponder on that: if greatness should come to thee one day, would thou rather be prepared for its obligations and duties or taken unawares?~
@44   = ~I apologize for having touched on an unhealed wound, but would not Gorion want thee to continue thy lessons? Dost thou want not to do so in his memory?~
@45   = ~So dost thou consider thyself destined for greatness? If that is the case, would thou not rather be prepared for its obligations and duties, or would'st thou prefer to be taken unawares?~
@46   = ~Ah, to be taken unawares by thee...~
@47   = ~Why, but saving me from captivity of course! That alone marks thee for greatness. Would thou not rather be prepared for its obligations and duties or taken unawares?~
@48   = ~Perhaps we could discuss a light historical topic, such as "The History of Lady Dynaheir". 'Twill surely keep me awake.~
@49   = ~I promise thee that I myself have no liking for wasting time on empty chatter. I can only hope that thou grow to enjoy the benefits of such discourses.~
@50   = ~I should try to keep thee interested enough not to doze off. But should thou be overwhelmed by thy weariness, thou hath mine word that I would cover thee with thy cloak and let thee rest till morning undisturbed.~
@51   = ~I am starting to suspect that falling asleep might prove even more interesting than the discourse, my caring scholar. *make a leg to Dynaheir*~
@52   = ~In either case it should prove an interesting pastime.~
@53   = ~A history of one who observes histories makes for a boring narration. This is why I have embarked on dajemma as my people have done for years uncounted. And since thou knoweth the most turbulent part of mine journey, what need dost thou have of insignificant details?~
@54   = ~Still, I would like very much to hear the complete story, Dynaheir.~
@55   = ~'Tis untrue!~
@56   = ~You are right. In any case, I already know everything I need to know of you: you are an intelligent, beautiful and mysterious witch. And you like history.~
@57   = ~Whatever. If you do not want to tell, I won't insist.~
@58   = ~I would not argue with thee about it now. We shall see... thou may yet cometh to like it.~
@59   = ~Thou art being excessively forward. I do not take it as an offense, as sometimes it signifies great shyness in a person, and thou hath been raised in seclusion. But pray refrain from further discourtesies, my lord.~
@60   = ~Mayhap, when we have nothing of importance to discuss, I should tell thee more.~
@61   = ~*smiles* 'Twas quite courteous, <CHARNAME>. I thank thee for respecting my... mysteries.~
@62   = ~*For a brief moment it appears that Dynaheir is about to sigh with relief. But instead she smiles and walks away without another word.*~
@63   = ~For a scholar of history, the bitterest thing is to see the errors of old repeated. Look now at the commoners, listen to their words, calling for war with Amn.~
@64   = ~Amn threatens their livelihoods, Dynaheir, by poisoning the iron ore. It is not surprising that they are seeking retribution.~
@65   = ~Thou art right, the crowd's anger is fearsome and merciless. A just and strong ruler is needed during times like this, and the Dukes' power is wavering. Alas, it is likely that we will soon see war.~
@66   = ~War is never an error. It purges the corrupted blood of the nation and strengthens its spirit. Snort at me as much as you like, wizardess, but I stand with my people in this.~
@67   = ~*smile at Dynaheir* But only a measly scholar would give up on warning others, for the fright of tasting bile in her mouth.~
@68   = ~Retribution will only make the quarrel last, till both sides have long forgotten what was the initial cause for disagreement. And the unending strife can grind even the greatest powers into dust. Dost thou know the history of Narfell and Raumathar?~
@69   = ~No, I have not, my wise comrade. I would gladly hear thee recount the tale. Surely it will bring me the benefit of enlightenment and great enjoyment, for I love the sound of thy voice.~
@70   = ~I have read a manuscript, but it strikes me that thou art of a nation that descends from Raumvira, and therefore thine account wilt be filled with liveliness, which I failed to find in the scroll.~
@71   = ~Yes, who does not? They were two great Empires of old that fought until both nigh disappeared. Do you think that Baldur's Gate and Amn have unwittingly stepped onto the same path?~
@72   = ~Nope, but I have a feeling that it would be illuminated in a matter of seconds. Go ahead, Dyna.~
@73   = ~Narfell and Raumathar? What's so special about it? The strongest survived, and the weaker one was obliterated! That's how the world is, and if that surprises you, then you are more naive than one would expect from a learned woman of your years.~
@74   = ~What I am afraid of, is that there is indeed a strong hand in this.~
@75   = ~Dynaheir, I do not understand what thou means... Surely, a person of power is what's needed to resolve the crisis.~
@76   = ~Do not fret, wizardess. *wink at her* <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep is going to set the things straight.~
@77   = ~But it acts to disturb the peace? Why?~
@78   = ~Gorion used to say that some think that blood does not leave stains on gold. Let black plague take those who profit from wars!~
@79   = ~Thou suppose? Hast thou heard of the nations of Narfell and Raumathar, and what hath befallen them?~
@80   = ~I have read a manuscript, but it strikes me that thou art of a nation that descends from Raumvira, and therefore thine account wilt be filled with liveliness, which I failed to find in the scroll. Mayhap that explains the difference in our opinions.~
@81   = ~Yes, who has not? They were two great Empires of old that fought until both nigh disappeared. Do you think that Baldur's Gate and Amn have unwittingly stepped onto the same path?~
@82   = ~'Tis true. *pauses for a moment and looks at you attentively* Hast thou heard of the nations of Narfell and Raumathar, and what hath befallen them?~
@83   = ~Whoa! I did not mean that you should educate me! But... well, go ahead, if you wish. I'll do anything for those pretty eyes.~
@84   = ~I have read a manuscript, but it strikes me that thou art of a nation that descends from Raumvira, and therefore thy account wilt be filled with liveliness, which I failed to find in the scroll.~
@85   = ~*Dynaheir's face is serene, the way she puts a strand of hair behind her ear is casual, but you have the awkward feeling that she is unsettled by your words. Was there a shade of a pleased smile at the corner of her mouth?*~
@86   = ~Raumathar and Narfell were two great Empires of old. Narfell was a great and cruel empire whose leaders made dark pacts with creatures from other planes. Raumathar was a nation of eastern nomads, who drove into the Endless Wastes, eventually extending as far as Sossal in the north and the Lake of Mists in the south. Their famed battle mages proved an even match for the Narfellian horsemen and demonologists. Although separated by the Great Glacier, the two empires were each other's mortal enemies.~
@87   = ~After centuries of border disputes, a final war erupted. Great heroes fought in the blood-soaked steppes and marshes, and some names the sands of time spared for us to sing of. Rauthok and Jesthren and Halduplac art all famed for their deeds. It is said that both Narfell and Raumathar summoned all their might for the last battle. Netherworld fiends fought against dragons, dwarves and men died, cities were burned, and in the end, where the two proud Empires once stood, now lay the Endless Wastes.~
@88   = ~Do you think, Dynaheir, that Amn and Baldur's Gate have unwittingly stepped onto the same path?~
@89   = ~Yes, but unless I am mistaken, these wars shaped thine own nation, wizardess. Was not Rashemen's famed warrior spirit wrought like a fine blade when thy people fought, caught between the two warring Empires? No ill wind blows that does not favor someone.~
@90   = ~A fine tale, Dynaheir, but we must get along.~
@91   = ~No, what I am afraid of is that the people of Amn and Baldur's Gate art being manipulated into this war by someone who knows history.~
@92   = ~Dynaheir, I do not understand what thou means...~
@93   = ~You think that someone is trying to instigate war between the two nations. Why?~
@94   = ~Young man, I oft find it hard to believe that thou wert reared in the famed citadel of learning! Very well, I should disregard thy profane manners for more pressing things. Now listen, and try to hear.~
@95   = ~Thou art naïve, if thou believes that there was a winner in that war. Indeed, the land of Narfell still exists today, but its people are primitive and they only differ in their status from the Raumvira, in that they kept the name attached to modern maps, while "Boundless Raumathar" canst only be found in thy library's old scrolls.~
@96   = ~Thou art a passing wise woman, Dynaheir, and I agree with thee. Dost thou think that Amn and Baldur's Gate have unwittingly stepped onto the same path to self-destruction?~
@97   = ~Yes, yes but unless I am mistaken, these wars shaped thine own nation, wizardess. Was not Rashemen's famed warrior spirit wrought like a fine blade when thy people fought, caught between the two warring Empires? No ill wind blows that does not favor someone.~
@98   = ~*smiles* Indeed, a hero is needed, but would it be one who rules? I fear that among the powerful there is one who seeks to bring the two nations to collide.~
@99   = ~You think that someone is deliberately plotting to start strife between the two nations? Why?~
@100  = ~*Dynaheir smiles at your jest and says in a matching light tone.* Indeed, thou might just be the one all the ancient tales speak of.~
@101  = ~I cannot say for sure, <CHARNAME>, but these events do not seem... accidental. There art men who art like ticks - they grow fatter on blood. *thoughtfully* I hope... I hope that thou art not one of them.~
@102  = ~You mean... vampires? I am definitely not a vampire, my beauty, otherwise I would not be chatting with you, but nuzzling your pretty neck.~
@103  = ~I am good enough at killing, Dynaheir, but I do not enjoy the slaughter.~
@104  = ~Whatever. Let us just go.~
@105  = ~And if I am, then what?~
@106  = ~My people hath survived, but many wondrous things perished. And it may well be that one such battle will be fought where none shall walk away at all. Oblige me, <CHARNAME>, and remember what I have said.~
@107  = ~We will walk then, but... <CHARNAME>, please think of what we have just talked of whilst we art walking.~
@108  = ~I fear that among the powerful there is one who seeks to bring the two nations to collide.~
@109  = ~Gorion taught thee well.~
@110  = ~By the Three! Thou art a brat who knows not when jest is proper and when it is not!~
@111  = ~*Dynaheir nods contentedly to herself, whispering something. You think that you caught a word "hope".*~
@112  = ~*Dynaheir shrugs as if what you said does not matter, but she pinches the bridge of her nose slightly, as she always does when she thinks of something important.*~
@113  = ~Yestereve we talked of war and power, and since then I wonder, <CHARNAME>, if thou art trying to stop this coming war?~
@114  = ~Dyna, you speak to me like I'm a flamin' Duke or somethin'!~
@115  = ~*grin* To stop it and let my favorite historian run out of things to scribble down in her notebook? I do not think so!~
@116  = ~Hathran, thou honor me with thy question, but surely thou must realize that 'tis not in my power to stop a war. Why, only a few short weeks ago, my expertise in warfare was limited to fetching a sword to the mighty guard of Candlekeep, Hull.~
@117  = ~I would do what I can, though, by all gods, it is little enough.~
@118  = ~Seldarine, you are a persistent human! Yes, I would try to stop anything that is threatening the peace of the heartwoods. Human wars are one of these things.~
@119  = ~You are a persistent human! Why would I try to stop the human's war, when they throw dirt, when they swear at me whenever they see me?~
@120  = ~No, Dynaheir, I have no inclination to mingle in politics. I only wish to find my foster father's murderer and exact my revenge.~
@121  = ~I told you yesterday - I believe this war is necessary. Besides, this is my chance to win fortune and glory, witch. Why would I thwart my own future?~
@122  = ~I am speaking to you as a friend who wants to know thine opinions. If thou would not have it, then I shall be silent and draw my conclusions from thine actions alone.~
@123  = ~Right. Let's do that.~
@124  = ~Yeah, I see. Well, for all the good it does, coming from an errand boy, I'd be trying t' stop the mess with Amn.~
@125  = ~Nay, what for? The war's my chance t' win gold and fame. I'm an orphan, Dyna, and I have to think of how t' earn my bread.~
@126  = ~Thine own country is in peril, and thou art making quips!~
@127  = ~Dynaheir, I'm doing what I can, but why should I be gloomy-faced?~
@128  = ~*trying to keep your face straight* Indeed, Hathran, neither words, nor sentiment were proper. *grin* But I had a theory that excitement would suit you, my lady, and now it is confirmed. Thine eyes did'st brighten, and the color of thine eyes did'st remind me of dawns over the Sea of Swords.~
@129  = ~You must admit, though, that histories write little of peaceful times. And don't you want me to become a war-hero, like that... Rautham we talked about yesterday?~
@130  = ~Oh, beat it, woman! Who do you think I am to ask me questions like that? A flaming Duke?~
@131  = ~And since then thou wert victorious in battles with monsters that terrify the commoners. Thou leads our company. 'Tis good that thou art humble, but thou must see that thou art not an errand boy any longer. So dost not answer me as one.~
@132  = ~*mockingly* As my lady commands.~
@133  = ~You are right. Well, here is my answer: I will do what I can to stop this war.~
@134  = ~Well, lady, if I am to grow into a hero's shoes, the war is just the thing I need to win fame and fortune!~
@135  = ~*smiles privately* Too long thou hast been the apprentice of a great man, <CHARNAME>. 'Tis time for thee to speak in a hero's voice. Say that thou will stop the war, say it in such a way that if I were not thy follower already, I would become one.~
@136  = ~*cough* Dynaheir, you embarrass me!~
@137  = ~This war will not happen. So say I, <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep.~
@138  = ~I swear a solemn oath to stop the impending war with Amn.~
@139  = ~This war will not happen. You have my word for it.~
@140  = ~I will not commit myself to such a horrendously difficult task, Dynaheir.~
@141  = ~What I have already said was enough, Dynaheir.~
@142  = ~It makes me cringe knowing that thou thinks of the war that will bleed thy country dry as someone else's war. But thou art a Tel'Quessir, and it seems that thou hath inherited thy kin's custom even after a human man's tutelage.~
@143  = ~True. Now leave me be, human.~
@144  = ~I was brought up by a human, yes. But I still have a hard time understanding them. Perhaps, you can help me with that.~
@145  = ~I am very grateful to Gorion for all his efforts, but I always wanted to find my own kin and live among them. Is that so difficult to accept?~
@146  = ~There art bigots amongst every peoples who judge others with a mule's persistence, a monkey's cruelty and a snake's venom. I have known thee for only a short time, and I have seen that thou art a good man. Those who art willing to look will see the same, and 'tis their opinion that matters. Take heart in this, <CHARNAME>.~
@147  = ~Consider also that if anything can change mobs' views, 'twill be thine own deeds.~
@148  = ~Now answer me.~
@149  = ~*mockingly* How charitable of you to take pity on a poor orc.~
@150  = ~Noble words, that. But if I am not mistaken - no, never mind.~
@151  = ~At first what thou speaks makes sense. Still, wars tend to undo many more heroes than they create. In troubled times, one can find glory as a peacemaker, <CHARNAME>. I would strongly advise thee to seek it.~
@152  = ~Many do fall in battles, but many also become heroes. A peacemaker is only one. I have but a slim chance.~
@153  = ~It is an appealing thought, Dynaheir. I will ponder it.~
@154  = ~I stand a good chance to be unmade whether I seek war or not, Dynaheir. So I had better find the one who sends assassins after me, and think later of the country's affairs. If I live.~
@155  = ~All right, Dynaheir. Thou hadst convinced me. I'll give a shot at stopping the war, though I would not hold my breath if I were you. I am little more than an errand boy.~
@156  = ~No reason at all for thee to be gloomy. Yet baiting me was childish, <CHARNAME>.~
@157  = ~That red? *presses her palm against her cheek* I think thou didst get carried away with thy fantasy. Now, if thou art done with thine... experiments, let us attend to the matters at hand.~
@158  = ~Thou means Rauthok? Thou dost not have to be a warlord to get into history books, <CHARNAME>. At least in mine history books. Wars tend to undo many more heroes than they create. In troubled times, one can find glory as a peacemaker, <CHARNAME>. I would strongly advise thee to seek it.~
@159  = ~It is an appealing thought, Dynaheir. I will ponder on it.~
@160  = ~You are right, Hathran, though your position surprises me, given the warrior culture of your nation. I do not want to see my country torn by a war, and I will do what I can to prevent it.~
@161  = ~Oh, I would do anything to get into *your* history book... if you know what I mean. *grin*~
@162  = ~Thou art right, I have spoken too forcefully. As they say in Cormyr, if someone else hath walked the King's Road for thee, thou would not see Suzail. If thou wish, thou can tell me what thou thinks, otherwise I shall be silent and draw my conclusions from thine actions alone.~
@163  = ~I see. Well, if thou needs to know, I would stop this war... if I can.~
@164  = ~And why, o wise one, should I try to stop the war, if that is my chance to win fame and fortune?~
@165  = ~I did not mean to humiliate thee. My intentions were fair.~
@166  = ~A man is not born a hero, <CHARNAME>, but becomes one. Willingly or not, but thou stepped on this path. Now to survive, thou needs to know what to do. I shall try to teach thee.~
@167  = ~Why art thou taking such keen interest in mine success, Hathran?~
@168  = ~Thank you... I guess.~
@169  = ~Just leave me be, witch! I can cope on my own.~
@170  = ~*smile* Let me be a hero in mine own way, Dynaheir. Or hadst thou already writ mine history and found I do not fit?~
@171  = ~Well said, <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep. Well said.~
@172  = ~I came across as a complete prat then, didn't I, Dynaheir?~
@173  = ~I will stop this war, my lady Dynaheir. You have my solemn vow.~
@174  = ~*Dynaheir looks at you thoughtfully and says nothing. However, you feel that she disapproves of you.~
@175  = ~Oh, quit staring at me! I want no advice from you, nor your friendship. Just do my bidding, will you?~
@176  = ~Dynaheir... I just cannot do that... I am not a great captain of my people with a shiny sword.~
@177  = ~Alright, woman. I will stop this flamin' war if you insist so. Just quit looking at me with those eyes. They are burrowing into my mind like augers.~
@178  = ~Then I hope that thou art one of the noblest men, whose casual word is as good as the other's blood oath.~
@179  = ~Why art thou taking such keen interest in me, Hathran?~
@180  = ~Just leave me be, witch! Just leave me alone! I have no liking for your games.~
@181  = ~Thou canst count on mine assistance in teaching thee the ways of men, <CHARNAME>.~
@182  = ~So does that mean that you are going to make a man out of me? *grin*~
@183  = ~I count on thine advice, my lady.~
@184  = ~No... not at all. I understand thee, but since thy desire cannot be fulfilled easily, it would be wise for thee to learn to enjoy the company of humans.~
@185  = ~A slim chance of becoming the one... or a dubious chance of becoming one of many... Is that so difficult to choose, <CHARNAME>?~
@186  = ~Why art thou taking such keen interest in my choices, Hathran?~
@187  = ~I guess I would rather be the one, then.~
@188  = ~I will let thee wonder for now. Some things cannot be explained until the time is right.~
@189  = ~I would be a bad historian if I did such a thing, would I not? *Dynaheir speaks lightly, but you think you hear surprise in her voice.*~
@190  = ~Now, that's better.~
@191  = ~By the Three! Dost thou have any thoughts that are not bawdy?~
@192  = ~*smiles* Mayhaps... if 'prat' is a word for one valiant of spirit.~
@193  = ~*The common room is busy to<DAYNIGHT> and merry. But the jolly atmosphere never touches a small figure curled in an armchair with a notebook on her lap. Despite the various distractions: the shouts of drunks, the haze of cooking smoke, music and dim lights, the wizardess seems to be focused on her writing. Finally, she lifts her head and finds you with her gaze.*~
@194  = ~<CHARNAME>...~
@195  = ~Dynaheir, be kind! My mind is not on lessons tonight...~
@196  = ~*mockingly* Thy called?~
@197  = ~'Tis a lovely evening, my lady. Thou should join us and be merry. Perhaps, thou would dance with me? The music is rather pleasing...~
@198  = ~O wizardess, in the robes sewn with ancient runes, you are a spirit who stepped out of a tale of old... or perhaps of my own tale...~
@199  = ~So... What's the verdict? You were looking at me all night, Hathran. Do not try to deny it.~
@200  = ~Those were mine thoughts exactly, <CHARNAME>. The events doth take a toll on thee, and a man of thy years needs jolly company. Thus, I was going to excuse myself and withdraw for the night.~
@201  = ~Ah, good night, then.~
@202  = ~Do not go just yet. I will miss you looking at me. Do not bother to deny it... you did.~
@203  = ~So does a woman of your years, Dynaheir. Put this notebook aside and let me have the first dance.~
@204  = ~Seeing how you always try to make some stupid noble out of me, I reckon you'd want to teach me dancing. Imagine that I would become a hero indeed... and shame myself at some bloody foreign court by my lack of manners. 'Twould be entirely your fault, Dynaheir. So... why don't you and me-~
@205  = ~I see that thou art in good spirits. Thou will not miss me, then. I bid thee good night.~
@206  = ~Fare thee well... *chuckle* till... erm... yonder.~
@207  = ~Wait, wait! I did not mean to irk you. How about we make up? It would show me that you are not angry if you'd dance with me.~
@208  = ~Actually I will... I will miss you looking at me. Do not bother to deny it... you did.~
@209  = ~<CHARNAME>... I'd rather not.~
@210  = ~Now, if thou would excuse me, I need to go. There art a few scrolls I need to browse afore I can retire and-~
@211  = ~It's only one dance, Dynaheir! It's not going to slow you down on your way to becoming an archmage, I swear!~
@212  = ~You remind me of an old anecdote about Elminster... They say that once, when he was asked his preference, the old sage said that a man should have *both* a wife and a lover, so that he could tell the lover that he is going to spend time with his wife, and tell his wife that he is going to visit his lover, and go to the attic to study...~
@213  = ~If you wish.~
@214  = ~How about this: you dance with me, and then I go up with you, and we study the scrolls together... That would be very efficient.~
@215  = ~*with a sly grin* How about this: you dance with me, and then I go up with you, and we study the scrolls together... That would be very efficient.~
@216  = ~I would have cast the spell that holds a person in place, but alas, you would not then be able to dance...~
@217  = ~Dynaheir, do you... do you know how to dance?~
@218  = ~*smiles* My spirit is ready to walk upstairs, <CHARNAME>. I just wished to bid thee a good night.~
@219  = ~Have mercy on the poet - stay long enough for him to finish the verse... And if you are bored with my tongue's movements, maybe the movement of my legs will please you more? Care for a dance, lady?~
@220  = ~And what's upstairs, beauty? Only dust and spiders. Here, we can enjoy ourselves. Come, dance with me before going into hiding.~
@221  = ~Good night, my dream.~
@222  = ~I do not recall seeking thee out in particular. 'Tis a small room and crowded.~
@223  = ~Ah! But I have counted! You looked at me twenty four times, then frowned - nine times, and smiled to yourself - five times... You even sighed on one occasion and forgot to scribble a note into your journal.~
@224  = ~Oh, yes, I agree absolutely. You have missed too many opportunities to look at me already for all these obstructions. Let us correct it. How about you get out of this chair and dance a bit? Then you can look at me all you want...~
@225  = ~Of course. How stupid of me to imagine that a lady would think of seeking a dog-ugly face out in a crowd of good-looking humans.~
@226  = ~That must be it then... Good night.~
@227  = ~Yeah... you are right. It is way too crowded. I am going back to the rooms as well.~
@228  = ~*smiles* Good night.~
@229  = ~Thou art correct, it would be a useful skill for thee to have. But I cannot be thy dancing teacher.~
@230  = ~I am not angry, <CHARNAME>. Take my word for it.~
@231  = ~*Looks at you with a hint of sadness in her dark eyes* Sometimes, <CHARNAME>, the smallest thing can trigger one's demise.~
@232  = ~Dynaaaaaheir... it's only a dance. What wrong can come of it?~
@233  = ~Well, if you are going to be uptight about it... then I'd better let you go. Good night.~
@234  = ~Or it can raise a person up...~
@235  = ~No, 'twould not. I do not dance, <CHARNAME>.~
@236  = ~Then it is crucial that you learn. A woman of your grace should show it in more than throwing stones at goblins.~
@237  = ~Strange. Maidens do not usually spend half an hour trying to talk their way out of a dance with me. Cannot dance, huh!~
@238  = ~You do not dance, lady? Or you do not dance with monsters?~
@239  = ~Would thou allow me to teach thee? I have enjoyed our conversations and I would like to give thee something in return for thy wise words and good advice.~
@240  = ~I lied, Dynaheir. I know perfectly well how to dance. Let me show you... *smile* You cannot always lead, Hathran.~
@241  = ~Then we will try for the first time together. Come, Hathran, let us consider it another adventure we both plunge into with disregard for the mockery of commoners... Or do you want all of them to laugh at me alone?~
@242  = ~I simply do not know how to dance. It never interested me...~
@243  = ~Never until now. Right?~
@244  = ~Then it is crucial that you learn! A woman of your grace should show it in more than throwing stones at goblins.~
@245  = ~Would thou allow me to teach thee? I have enjoyed our conversations, and I would like to give thee something in return for thy wise words and good advice.~
@246  = ~Did I now?~
@247  = ~Oh my, that's some cold and dignified look! Prove that you do not care for me, Hathran. Let us dance, and if your eyelashes never flutter... I will accept that.~
@248  = ~You did... But I only noticed that because I looked your way myself so many times that I lost count... Will you dance with me, Dynaheir?~
@249  = ~No- no. Good night, Dynaheir.~
@250  = ~Tread carefully, <CHARNAME>. Self-pity is a sure way to self-destruction.~
@251  = ~A moment of weakness, lady. I am moody to<DAYNIGHT>. Dance with me, will you?~
@252  = ~Oh, quit it. Everybody treats me like dirt under their feet, even you.~
@253  = ~I care not what you say, human. Get away from me!~
@254  = ~It hath nothing to do with thee, <CHARNAME>. I do not dance at all. It never interested me.~
@255  = ~Never until now. But tonight... won't you consider it an exception? And you can write down in your journal how it feels to dance with a half-orc.~
@256  = ~Alright. I do not know what came over me. In all honesty I have never wanted to dance myself. Good night, woman.~
@257  = ~Would thou allow me to teach thee? I had enjoyed our conversations, and I would like to give thee something in return for thy wise words and good advice.~
@258  = ~*Dynaheir gets up and straightens her robes.*~
@259  = ~Have it thy way, then. Let us dance, <CHARNAME>.~
@260  = ~*Her narrow dark hand lands itself on your shoulder, and slender fingers tremble slightly in your grasp. Dynaheir smiles and lifts her chin up stubbornly. She is determined to dance the same way she does everything else - in good faith, and well.*~
@261  = ~Thou know - I have never danced in my life, but I would dance with thee tonight...~
@262  = ~Why would thou want to study mine- *Dynaheir lifts her eyes and notices your grin.* Thou goatish tickle-brained lewdster! *Dynaheir storms upstairs.*~
@263  = ~*Dynaheir greets you with a strange half-smile on her face*.~
@264  = ~I see from the circles under thine eyes that thou hath stayed up late last night. Didst thou have a good time?~
@265  = ~Oh, a jolly good time, Dynaheir, thank you.~
@266  = ~I missed thy company, m'lady, and regretted that thou had not partaken in the merriment. Mayhap next time?~
@267  = ~It was wonderful. Branwen kept me company, and it was... wonderful.~
@268  = ~To tell the truth... *breathe in and say rapidly* I spent most of my night gazing at the light in your window, Dynaheir. Make what you will out of that.~
@269  = ~'Twas nothing special, really. It's not like we were wined and dined in a Duke's Great Hall.~
@270  = ~Thou canst enjoy my company all day, <CHARNAME>, but I have no head for wine and no stamina for dancing the night away. *in a softer voice* But I am glad that thou hast enjoyed thyself.~
@271  = ~Branwen is a woman of honor, and she hath a great heart. Thou did well in courting her.~
@272  = ~*Dynaheir nodes approvingly, but you think that you can hear regret in her calm voice.*~
@273  = ~Hey, I did not court anyone!~
@274  = ~Yes, I think so. If I may confide in you, I think she's the woman for me.~
@275  = ~Do not so readily jump to those conclusions, lady.~
@276  = ~*Dynaheir holds your stare, and her lips become one straight line. She is angry, but it is hard to say if it is with you or with herself.*~
@277  = ~Thou art good at it... at dancing, I mean.~
@278  = ~Good morning to you, too. So you liked my dancing, then?~
@279  = ~Lady, you bring out the best in me.~
@280  = ~I am glad to see thee pleased by mine aptitude.~
@281  = ~It was a magical night, Dynaheir. I never once thought of how awkward I looked... and I did not care of what others were thinking watching a monster twirl around the fairest maiden in the room. Did you cast a spell, per chance?~
@282  = ~I would lie, if I said that I did not. But-~
@283  = ~I am taking no buts, lady. You liked it and that's about it. *wink*~
@284  = ~I know of all the buts... I thought about it after we parted, and I do not want to compare notes with you.~
@285  = ~*sigh* But?~
@286  = ~I do not want any misunderstandings to come out of it, <CHARNAME>. Thou art young yet and hath not seen the world-~
@287  = ~And yet I am your elder, Human. Not to mention that my race is far more ancient than yours and is famed for having great knowledge, wisdom, spirituality and... Dynaheir, if you are ever uncertain of my intentions, ask me directly, and I will tell you the truth. Now, let us go.~
@288  = ~Dynaheir, Gorion taught me many things, but the most important among them was to be able to express myself. If you are ever uncertain of my intentions - ask me directly, and I will tell you the truth. Now, let us go.~
@289  = ~And so are you, lady.~
@290  = ~There will be nothing in the future to cause such... misunderstandings, Dynaheir.~
@291  = ~Whatever will be, will be. Let us not guess too far ahead.~
@292  = ~You are pale, fair mage. And there are circles under your eyes. Why are you so upset about a dance?~
@293  = ~I cast no spells, <CHARNAME>. Thou never looked awkward, and I was not the fairest maiden in the room.~
@294  = ~I apologize, but I must speak briskly and with coldness, even to keep thy friendship.~
@295  = ~<CHARNAME>, I have traveled across half of Faerun, whilst thou hast been hidden away in the citadel of learning. Books art a valuable ally in learning the ways of the world, but only afield does one mature.~
@296  = ~Do not take me for a boy who does not know what he wants, Hathran. I have seen more death than I cared for, and I have grieved. Do not scold me for seeking out joy.~
@297  = ~Is it a sin, being young?~
@298  = ~So, I want to learn. I know that I stand to make mistakes. So what?~
@299  = ~Did I forget to congratulate you on your thousandth birthday, elder Dynaheir?~
@300  = ~If your aim was to ruin it, you have succeeded. It's ruined.~
@301  = ~Do not be careless, <CHARNAME>. Then events will not catch thee off guard.~
@302  = ~Thou art right. 'Tis nothing, of course.~
@303  = ~I just want thee to be more cautious, <CHARNAME>. Some people hath a way of influencing... events. Thou might well be one of them.~
@304  = ~No, 'tis no sin... I just want thee to be more cautious, <CHARNAME>. Some people hath a way of influencing... events. Thou might well be one of them.~
@305  = ~<CHARNAME>! 'Tis not something thou canst ward off with a quip and a grin. Be cautious, and be alert to what thou art doing and why. Some people hath a way of influencing... events... and others. Thou might well be one of them.~
@306  = ~I envy thee for growing up in Candlekeep. 'Tis the place where the spirit of Alaundo the Seer wanders the grounds.~
@307  = ~*smile* Indeed, the Chant of Unfulfilled Prophecies is never interrupted... Oh Dynaheir, would that thou could see the monks singing of that which has not yet come to be. 'Tis... inspiring.~
@308  = ~Ah, lady, Alaundo's legacy is one of those things a young lad like me would talk to the visitors about in hopes to snatch a coin, without giving it a proper thought. Now I wish I had been more attentive... but it was always there, so I did not care to look at Alaundo's Nine Portents or listen to the Chant of Unfulfilled Prophecies.~
@309  = ~Alaundo? The name rings a bell, but I was never interested in the fortunetellers. All these grand events and dim references to the fall of Kings are not to my liking.~
@310  = ~Dynaheir, you are truly a wonder! Envying my growing with Alaundo's spirit! *guffaw* All I cared about was avoiding becoming one of those unfortunate 30 monks who memorize all nine thousand prophecies by heart. If I were to recite you ten a day, it would take me a good part of three years to go through all of them. The quantity defeats practicality.~
@311  = ~Alaundo followed Augathra the Mad, dost thou know it, my lady?~
@312  = ~*cautiously* Thou said... inspiring... How?~
@313  = ~Nobody said it better than Alaundo himself, Hathran. "Knowledge of the future is no key to happiness, nor should it allow complacency, only solace and truth. No matter how terrible is the tragedy, until the future day far yet to come, there will always be tomorrow." I... I especially find meaning in these words since Gorion's death.~
@314  = ~Well, if a mediocre scholar can achieve grandeur by recording tomes of pointless verses, then there is hope for all of us.~
@315  = ~I like the gleam in thine eyes not at all, Hathran. So a hunter regards her prey before loosing an arrow.~
@316  = ~Thou hast no knowledge of any individual prophecies, then? Hast thou studied the Nine Portents at all?~
@317  = ~Gorion didst recite me some, but I've always thought that one has to be a sage of advanced years to appreciate them.~
@318  = ~I doth remember the one which they said was about the Time of Troubles. "White bird shall vanish from the North, and great evil shall die and be reborn." Though why it was about the Time of Troubles, I recall not. To mine ears it sounded like a reference to an especially warm summer in the Icewind Dale, with all the snow melting, and the winter returning again after a time...~
@319  = ~I am ashamed to admit that the only one I recall is anecdotal, Hathran. Year 1263 - The Year of Tressym... "In the town of the moon, Birds for Lady shalt croon... " I recall it whispered that Lady Alustriel simply shrugged, pointing out that Alaundo's prophecies are about as widespread as the tressym that year... who indeed roosted on the rooftops of Silverymoon for a tenday.~
@320  = ~No... not really... Though wait! What was the chant on the day I left Candlekeep? Hmmm... some doomsaying... *imitate the Chanter* "The Lord of Murder shall perish, but in his doom he shall spawn a score of mortal progeny. Chaos will be sewn from their passage. So sayeth the wise Alaundo.”~
@321  = ~No... not really... Though wait! What was the chant on the day I left Candlekeep? I think the Voice of the East was singing something like: "In the Year of the Turrets a great host will come from the East like a plague of locusts. So sayeth the wise Alaundo."~
@322  = ~No... not really... Though wait! What was the chant on the day I left Candlekeep? I think the Voice of the North was singing something like: "When conflict sweeps across the Dales, the great lizards of the North shall descend with fire and fury. So sayeth the great Alaundo."~
@323  = ~No... not really... Though wait! What was the chant on the day I left Candlekeep? I think the Voice of the South was singing something like: "When shadows descend upon the lands, our divine lords will walk alongside us as equals. So sayeth the great Alaundo."~
@324  = ~No... not really... Though wait! What was the chant on the day I left Candlekeep? I think the Voice of the West was singing something like: "The wyrm shall wander the east, and such a pestilence will follow in his wake that all who know of his passing shall be stuck down by the plague. So sayeth the wise Alaundo."~
@325  = ~Thou art quick enough to dismiss the writings of someone who is considered the only true prophet.~
@326  = ~Alaundo was but a mediocre historian, Dynaheir. Why would his prophecies be better than his histories?~
@327  = ~Dynaheir, I was never interested... that's all. I hope thou doth not think less of me for that.~
@328  = ~You, on the other hand, seem to be very interested in Alaundo's prophecies.~
@329  = ~I read of that, but Augathra's visions are all but lost to us... Indeed, she lived seventeen centuries ago, and many of her writings art lost to the sands of time. Alaundo the Seer came to Candlekeep a year afore his death and gave the Nine Portents to the library for safekeeping. Such a wondrous foresight. Thou must be steeped in this lore, <CHARNAME>... Is such not true?~
@330  = ~You seem to be very interested in Alaundo's prophecies, Dynaheir.~
@331  = ~I do not claim to know all nine thousand prophecies of Alaundo by heart, no. But I remember a fair amount.~
@332  = ~Gorion didst recite me some, but I've always thought that one has to be a sage of advanced years to appreciate them.~
@333  = ~I remember the one which they said was about the Time of Troubles. "White bird shall vanish from the North, and great evil shall die and be reborn." Though why it was about the Time of Troubles, I recall not. To me it sounded like a reference to an especially warm summer in the Icewind Dale, with all the snow melting, and the winter returning again after a time...~
@334  = ~I am ashamed to admit that the only one I recall is anecdotal, Hathran. Year 1263 - The Year of Tressym... "In the town of the moon, Birds for Lady shalt croon...

@336  = ~Forgive me if I inadvertently touched a painful subject, <CHARNAME>. *Dynaheir seems ashamed for some reason and walks away without another word.*~
@337  = ~By the Three! I apologize, <CHARNAME>, thy joke had unsettled me.~
@338  = ~Or so looks a scholar who gets to discuss her favored subject.~
@339  = ~I see. *laughs* So I can not talk on my favored subject. Never mind, we shall discuss something else, then.~
@340  = ~What thou lack in age, my lady Dynaheir, thou doth make up in wisdom: thou may discourse on whatever subject thy choose.~
@341  = ~Perhaps another time?~
@342  = ~*sigh* Whatever you say.~
@343  = ~Ah, Six Portents. 'Tis largely considered amongst the scholars, that the passage refers to Mystra, as Alaundo oft used birds as a metaphor for deities, and he called the Lady of Magic a dove in prior volumes.~
@344  = ~Dost thou know more prophecies for the Year of Shadows?~
@345  = ~No, Dynaheir, I fear I do not.~
@346  = ~No... not really... Though wait! What was the chant on the day I left Candlekeep? Hmmm... some doomsaying... *Imitate the Chanter* "The Lord of Murder shall perish, but in his doom he shall spawn a score of mortal progeny. Chaos will be sewn from their passage. So sayeth the wise Alaundo.~
@347  = ~Indeed, it is quite funny. Though I would not dismiss the Portents as easily, for Alaundo's words do come to pass. But thou clearly hast no interest in it. Let us discuss something else, then.~
@348  = ~Dost thou find this one... upsetting?~
@349  = ~They are all like that, Dynaheir. All about plagues, wyrms and wars...~
@350  = ~Now that you mention it... I do not know why but it troubles me. It is about Bhaal's resurrection, is it not?~
@351  = ~Quite interesting... But tell me, <CHARNAME>... Dost thou by any chance come across a particular year in thy readings? The one that interests me is the Time of Troubles, the Year of Shadows.~
@352  = ~I have a scholar's interest, <CHARNAME>, I studied them while staying in Saerloon a few years ago, on my first dajemma.~
@353  = ~Perhaps then thou canst recite some for me?~
@354  = ~*Dynaheir's eyes survey your face closely. Visibly satisfied with what she sees, she says quietly:* Thou art troubled now? Take my advice, <CHARNAME> - remain troubled by these words.~
@355  = ~I need to talk to thee in private, <CHARNAME>.~
@356  = ~Then let us fall behind the others for a few moments.~
@357  = ~*grin self-assuredly* You have my ear, Dynaheir.~
@358  = ~I will not stand for secrets. Speak up, woman, and let everyone hear what you have to say to me.~
@359  = ~My lord... <CHARNAME>. I owe thee an apology. Thy dream last night-~
@360  = ~Thou wert right, as usual, m'lady. This conversation doth not need to be heard by anyone. We shall speak privately.~
@361  = ~What dream, Dynaheir? I had no dreams...~
@362  = ~-was quite pleasant. What of it?~
@363  = ~*Shuffle uneasily, but motion for Dynaheir to continue.*~
@364  = ~I've had strange dreams lately, Hathran. I saw Gorion and darkness...~
@365  = ~I would have thou wipe that smug smile off thy face, <CHARNAME>. I have come to apologize. Thy dream last night-~
@366  = ~I will smile whatever way I want to. What about last night?~
@367  = ~I am sorry. I thought that you might want to tell me something I would be happy to hear. But never mind what I thought. What's the matter?~
@368  = ~I had no dreams, Dynaheir.~
@369  = ~Thou doth not wish to spare my modesty, but I pity thine. Let us move to the side.~
@370  = ~If you insist. I am now curious what I have done that would shame me in the eyes of my comrades.~
@371  = ~I have done nothing to be embarrassed about, Wychlaran. Speak.~
@372  = ~Thou dost not remember it then. But if I would not tell thee, I would find no peace with myself, for I wronged thee.~
@373  = ~*blushes slightly* I know. But allow me to explain.~
@374  = ~My people hath ancient bloods in them, <CHARNAME>, and with it cometh the knowledge of magic runes, tattoos and shamans, the intuitive magic that our ancestors used afore they learnt from scrolls. I have an affinity for some of it - thou hath seen how I can ward off a poison...~
@375  = ~One other ability that I possess is to send my spirit wandering forth whilst my body is immovable. Thou didst appear distressed, and I was... worried about thee. I considered walking over to thy bedroll and checking upon thee, to make sure that no ill dreams assailed thee... and it took shape. In my thoughts, I looked down at thee, and saw that no trouble is weighing on thy brow. I moved a strand of hair out of thine eyes.~
@376  = ~*quietly* And what is there to apologize for, my lady? *You take Dynaheir's hand into yours and kiss it.*~
@377  = ~Gods be good! You moved my hair! Dynaheir, how would I ever be able to forgive you?!~
@378  = ~And?~
@379  = ~I remember the touch of your hand... I thought I was dreaming.~
@380  = ~We art alone now apart from that malodorous rodent, but this cannot be helped. Allow me to start from the beginning.~
@381  = ~*looks concerned* Didst thou? I thought that something was amiss - and that is why I had wronged thee. But allow me to explain myself.~
@382  = ~Thou art not making it easier. *Dynaheir does not take her hand away.*~
@383  = ~Alas, since my awareness slipped towards thee unchecked, it brushed thy consciousness.~
@384  = ~I have seen thy dream... about me.~
@385  = ~Dynaheir, I think it was you who were dreaming. I do not recall anything.~
@386  = ~And how often, Hathran, do you look into other's dreams?~
@387  = ~So? I dream about women often and with gusto. Stop fretting, Dynaheir...~
@388  = ~*faintly* I... erm... would have loved to have dreamed of you in a more appropriate fashion.~
@389  = ~I forgive you. Be careful with watching my dreams, though. Some of them are not as pleasant. I see blood, darkness, corpses... not for the fainthearted.~
@390  = ~Mussing thy mane is not what bothers me, <CHARNAME>. There is more...~
@391  = ~The more the merrier! Did you drop a tear or two on my pale cheek?~
@392  = ~Confess thy crimes, Hathran, and I promise to be merciful.~
@393  = ~Since I cannot come up with a brooding and manly way to answer this... please, go ahead.~
@394  = ~More? Then thou will have to wait until I take a breath... I will need to hold it for the revelation.~
@395  = ~Thou wert not dreaming it, thou felt my touch. That I do not regret, for there is no dishonor in comforting a comrade. But there is more...~
@396  = ~Since I cannot come up with a brooding and manly way to answer this... please, go ahead.~
@397  = ~More? Then you will have to wait until I take a breath... I'll hold it for the revelation.~
@398  = ~No, I was not. I am trained to distinguish between a dream and spirit wandering.~
@399  = ~It maketh me wonder what else thou art trained to do, Hathran?~
@400  = ~Well, you know one of my dreams... If you are a friend to me, I am not afraid to hold you in such confidence.~
@401  = ~I cannot accuse you of wrongdoing for it was accidental, yet I hope that you understand my need for keeping my distance from you from now on.~
@402  = ~Get away from me, witch! At least until my anger has settled. And you should know well enough when that will happen, with your... soul-spying!~
@403  = ~Thou hath the right to be terse. 'Tis forbidden lore, <CHARNAME>, and I have violated thy private world. I would not do it again, I swear by the Three.~
@404  = ~Well, you know one of my dreams... If you are a friend to me, I am not afraid to hold you in such confidence... once.~
@405  = ~'Tis forbidden lore, and by good reason, <CHARNAME>. When mind to mind touches, strange things happen. Thy will was stronger than mine, and thou brought me into thy dream. What thou hast seen of me was me, only in thy full command.~
@406  = ~Now that thou know how my lips taste and how strong my embrace is in the world of sleepers, mayhap thou would want to make a comparison with the real world?~
@407  = ~I am curious to learn the difference between caressing you in dreams, and in truth. How about you?~
@408  = ~That's quite a feat - to enter a man's dream. It maketh me wonder what else thou art trained to do, Hathran?~
@409  = ~Well... If you are a friend to me, I am not afraid to hold you in such confidence.~
@410  = ~Are you flaming trying to tell me that I bloody raped your spirit in my idiotic dream?!~
@411  = ~Dost not seek thy fault where it is none but mine.~
@412  = ~I am not craven, <CHARNAME>, but in the future the only way I woud'st know what thou art dreaming of would be from thine own words.~
@413  = ~I am a Hathran, <CHARNAME>, and I am trained as a battle wizard, to read and interpret ancient manuscripts and to observe events. I am trained to take actions that benefit mine nation. I have shown little promise with herbal lore, poisons and healing. Does that satisfy thy curiosity?~
@414  = ~Yes, that's sufficient. Thou art a useful companion.~
@415  = ~*grin mischievously* Am I glad that thou hast shown no promise with poisons! I will rest easier in thy company from now on.~
@416  = ~You know what, wench? You are scary. I hope that you understand my need to keep my distance from you from now on.~
@417  = ~I am grateful for thy show of trust, and I would not betray it in the future by an ill-thought action. *Dynaheir bows to you slightly.*~
@418  = ~I told thee that 'twas a forbidden thing I did, and I have no intention to err again. But 'tis better for us to talk later when thou art not so red in the face.~
@419  = ~Yes, thou art right. 'Tis difficult for me to restrain my fury now.~
@420  = ~'Tis merely embarrassment. 'Twill indeed pass, and we shall be on friendly terms once more.~
@421  = ~'Tis impossible, <CHARNAME>. A mage's armor and weapon is her mind, and it hath to be kept orderly. *Dynaheir turns to go away.*~
@422  = ~*You whisper to her retreating back.* But I love thee...~
@423  = ~Lady, stop fooling yourself. Sooner or later you will be mine.~
@424  = ~Indeed, thank you for reminding me. I will attend immediately to rebuilding my defenses. I would not want to fall because a stray dream distracted me from my spellbook the night before.~
@425  = ~I might not have the need of learning spells by heart, but concentration is what keeps me alive. I will attend immediately to rebuilding my defenses.~
@426  = ~That applies to those who have no arcane gift as well. It is dangerous to be distracted by chance revels. I will attend to rebuilding my defenses immediately.~
@427  = ~If there is no more to life than battles, then is it worth living?~
@428  = ~No, <CHARNAME>, I am not saying that. *coldly* I leave it to thee to recall just how willing I was.~
@429  = ~*You smile at the memory.* Would you be as willing in the real world as you were in the world of dreams?~
@430  = ~We can always study the difference between caressing each other in dreams and in truth, Dynaheir.~
@431  = ~That's quite a feat - to enter a man's dream. It maketh me wonder what else thou art trained to do, Dynaheir?~
@432  = ~I take it that it pleased thee not. Let us then put it behind us and remain good friends. There are women who'd find the thought of being attracted to me not quite so distressing.~
@433  = ~*You know that Dynaheir heard you, for she stumbles, but she continues walking away. There is nothing to do but catch up with the rest of the party.*~
@434  = ~Minsc... *sighs* We art most grateful for thy efforts.~
@435  = ~Yes, Minsc, I am quite grateful to Boo, as well. Now, if thou would excuse me, I wish to hold my counsel with <CHARNAME>...~
@436  = ~...and so it happened that Thay attempted its first assault in the year 934 through the Gorge of Gauros, but was repelled.~
@437  = ~Oh, Dynaheir, must we talk of events so far removed?~
@438  = ~And now, four hundred years later, they are still unsuccessful. Thy nation has stomach for repelling foreign invaders, Dynaheir.~
@439  = ~Dynaheir, from what you told me of Rashemen... what might Thay possibly want there so badly?~
@440  = ~*smile* And the latest part of this never-ending struggle plays out right under my nose.~
@441  = ~Were Rashemi women as beautiful then as they are now?~
@442  = ~Events thus far removed reflect on our present. Indeed, we art ever watchful, <CHARNAME>.~
@443  = ~The last vile attack on Rashemen came not three years past, when Red Wizards attempted to melt the glaciers on the slopes of the Icerim Mountains.~
@444  = ~Dynaheir... you got my attention. Why would Thayvians melt glaciers?~
@445  = ~By the Nine Hells! But why?!~
@446  = ~Let me guess - that caused flooding, and the Thayvian armies tried to march in, while the Hathran were distracted with repairing the damage.~
@447  = ~And that's right after scheming with Tuigans when they had invaded Thay! One has to hand it to Red Wizards - they are persistent buggers and inventive.~
@448  = ~'Tis vile! For meltwaters must have rushed down wreaking havoc and destruction on their path!~
@449  = ~Dynaheir, let us give war history a break for a day.~
@450  = ~I thank thee for saying this, <CHARNAME>. We might as well take pride in our prowess, for we have no other choice but to be warriors. Thay ever looks askance at our land.~
@451  = ~'Tis a matter of pride, for Thay's own soil is richer than ours, and their land is gentler to peoples. But they ever want to conquer - Rashemen, Aglarond, even Mulhorand. 'Tis some sort of greed that I canst not comprehend.~
@452  = ~Alas, Edwin Odesseiron is no exception; many in his nation harbor the same stubborn ill will toward Rashemi and indeed to anything in the world that they do not possess. 'Tis difficult to understand such boundless greed...~
@453  = ~In troubled times, <CHARNAME>, beauty is naught. The sturdiness of the sword arm and the potency of spells, the true heart and the ability to take charge equal to the ability to serve - that is what matters.~
@454  = ~For a man - yes, but a maiden who looks worse than an average cow wouldst not get my respect, even if she can better Tethir the Dragonslayer in swordplay and outdo Elminster in a wizards' duel.~
@455  = ~You are mistaken. In troubled times protecting beauty is one of the things that makes the fighting worthwhile. Be it the beauty of the land, or of its peoples.~
@456  = ~For a comrade at arms - yes, that's all that matters. But sometimes... sometimes in the most troubled times, in the worst kind of circumstances, camaraderie is not the only connection that forms.~
@457  = ~All of it contributes to beauty, Hathran. Thou, for example, is educated and strong of character. Thy heart is honest, and in battle I do not have to look thy way to check if thou need to be delivered. Yet, amongst other maidens thou art like a moon among stars.~
@458  = ~Such qualities as thou hast described art inseparable from beauty. A pommel gem of a mighty sword is beautiful, but it also balances the weapon and becomes a part of its power. My lady art both beautiful and valorous - and I cannot separate one from the other.~
@459  = ~To provide a distraction for Hathran, meltwater caused flooding in Immilmar and Mulsantir, and my sisters went to repair damages and salvage what they could. Meanwhile, Thayvian forces crossed the foothills of the High Country.~
@460  = ~How did you manage to stop them?~
@461  = ~'Tis vile!~
@462  = ~*Dynaheir nods curtly.* Yes. In the year 1362, attempting to enter Rashemen through Thesk along the Golden Way, the Thayvians were defeated yet again, but scorched the western shore of the Lake of Tears to bare rock. In the year 1360, they brought the Tuigan Horde upon us...~
@463  = ~Dynaheir, didst thou fight each time in these battles?~
@464  = ~One might think that Thayvians would grow tired after 400 years of defeats.~
@465  = ~Why don't we speak of something lighter, Dynaheir? For example, were the Rashemi women of old as beautiful as they are now?~
@466  = ~I grew up in a peaceful place, Dynaheir... so it is difficult for me to imagine your plight. Yet... I... pity you, who had to mature knowing that it was not a question of if, but when the next war comes. Please, do not take "pity" adversely.~
@467  = ~*coldly* You forgot that two years after the union with Tuigans, Thay attempted to enter Rashemen through Thesk along the Golden Way. The Thayvians were defeated yet again, but scorched the western shore of the Lake of Tears to bare rock.~
@468  = ~I grew up in a peaceful place, Dynaheir... so it is difficult for me to imagine your plight. Yet... I... pity you, who had to mature knowing that it was not a question of if, but when the next war comes. Please, do not take "pity" adversely.~
@469  = ~*Dynaheir laughs at your impersonation, unexpectedly merry and childish in her excitement.*~
@470  = ~Well, I too thought it would be better than to argue with him. But tell me more of Thay and Rashemen.~
@471  = ~*Glad that you made the witch forget her serious manner for a moment, you throw your head back and join her in laughing at Edwin's retreat.~
@472  = ~Oh, Dynaheir! I wish you were merrier. Thy smile makes thee look so beautiful! Say, were women of Rashemen just as fair in the Olden times?~
@473  = ~Be careful with the Red Wizard's advice, <CHARNAME>. We Rashemi know all too well how devious Thayvians can be.~
@474  = ~Thou hast done naught yet so that thy respect mattered to a woman such as thou hast described. I hope that Gorion taught thee better in other areas. Now, shall we return to the war history?~
@475  = ~I had not considered that before, <CHARNAME>. 'Tis well said, and a fair reason to swing a sword. Now, shall we return to the war history?~
@476  = ~That is what bards oft sing sweetly about. But such songs art most often made in the times of peace. But what would thou order when there is no peace, nor respite?~
@477  = ~Thou speak fairly, <CHARNAME>, and would I be a maiden of thine years or experiences, I would hear more like that. But I feel that my task is to talk to thee of the world's events, not of mine qualities, real or imaginable. Now, please, pay attention to the war history.~
@478  = ~The elementals were angered at such defilement of nature and came to our aid. And so Thay was defeated again. But the Red Wizards have little regard even for the Great Mother herself. In the year 1362, whilst retreating, Thayvians scorched the western shore of the Lake of Tears to bare rock. In the year 1360, when they brought the Tuigan Horde upon us, they parted the waters of the lake to allow the Horde to retreat...~
@479  = ~I stood with mine sisters in the last battle, but I had been away on my dajemma when the Horde came.~
@480  = ~You have already been on a dajemma?~
@481  = ~Ah, I see. Still formidable.~
@482  = ~The history teaches us that the Red Wizards would never tire, <CHARNAME>. But as it was said of old: He who came to us with a sword, would die on a sword.~
@483  = ~I hear it in thy voice that thou did not seek to belittle me, <CHARNAME>. I think that any who hath to sleep with one hand on the hilt of a sword canst understand my people's grief. And thou... thou now dost just that. So I pity thee for thou having to learn such a cruel lesson.~
@484  = ~Indeed, I went travelling before. If thou wish, I will tell thee of it some other time.~
@485  = ~Thine adventures, <CHARNAME>, they art reminiscent of mine people's custom. Of dajemma.~
@486  = ~What is a dajemma, Dynaheir?~
@487  = ~You and Minsc keep repeating this word... dajemma. But what is it?~
@488  = ~Indeed. Rashemi's custom is to go to a foreign land. I am but discovering my own.~
@489  = ~'Tis a passing wise custom. One has to see the world and meet different folk afore one can claim that they have fully grown.~
@490  = ~Dynaheir, your people go on dajemma, thinking it a great adventure at best and a drinking contest at worst. I have been chased away from my hometown and hounded across the hills and dales by a mysterious nemesis. How can you compare the two?~
@491  = ~Gorion once told me that my mother was a Rashemi by blood. I have no one to tell me if that is true, and how she came so far West... Perhaps I am but continuing a dajemma that was interrupted many years ago...~
@492  = ~Gorion once told me that my mother was a Rashemi by blood. I have not thought of it lately... with learning who sired me. Perhaps I am but continuing a dajemma that was interrupted many years ago by a terrifying crime.~
@493  = ~'Tis my people's way of coming of age. Afore a Rashemi turns twenty, they need to journey far afield, seeking for knowledge of foreign lands and of herself. My companion, Minsc, was on such journey.~
@494  = ~I grieve with thee for our fallen comrade.~
@495  = ~M'lady, I know that thy desire is to have thy companion along, but unfortunately 'tis impossible now. But rest assured, lady, in mine company thou need no other bodyguard.~
@496  = ~Bah! The man is better off dead, if you ask me. He was just a walking embarrassment to you.~
@497  = ~You do not need Minsc, m'lady. He was forever interfering... with his reckless attitudes. I am surprised that a woman of your sophistication put up with such a brute.~
@498  = ~He died valiantly, and we buried him with honor. Mourning his passing would insult the bravery with which he didst fall.~
@499  = ~Dynaheir, why should we talk about Minsc? You are on dajemma yourself, aren't you?~
@500  = ~'Tis my people's way of coming of age. Afore a Rashemi turns twenty, they need to journey far afield, seeking for knowledge of foreign lands and of herself. My companion, Minsc, is on such a spiritual journey.~
@501  = ~Minsc - spiritual? *double over with laughter* I... I am so- *Throw a quick glance Minsc's way. The huge warrior walks in front of you, all seven feet of armored muscle with a yellowish hamster perched on his shoulder. Boo turns, throws you a quick glance from its bright beady eyes and leans to sniff Minsc's ear. His whiskers tremble indignantly, and you'd think he is complaining to Minsc about your mockery.* Spiritual journey! I am sorry, Dyna- *Another fit of laughter overcomes you.*~
@502  = ~One can regard a coming of age as a journey, regardless if he walks where Shaundakul leads him, or if he never goes beyond the gates of his native city.~
@503  = ~Then, Dynaheir, I cannot understand why you think that my misadventures are anything like a dajemma. I did not depart on a soul-searching expedition. I have been chased away from my hometown and hounded across the hills and dales by a mysterious nemesis. How can you compare the two?~
@504  = ~Thou art right - thou art discovering it, because thou dost know neither thy own land, nor thy people. The tall walls of Candlekeep have hidden it from thee for many a year, and now thou art just as foreign as I am.~
@505  = ~As you say, lady.~
@506  = ~I am not that naive of the customs and peoples of Baldur's Gate, Dynaheir. I have been outside of the keep with Gorion, and I have spoken with travelers. Not to mention the books...~
@507  = ~It seems to me, Dynaheir, that despite the local differences, all lands and peoples are in principle made the same way. Some hold power, and others cower, some help others, and others wrong everyone they meet, some work hard, and others laze their way, some plow fields, and others can never settle. I have seen Candlekeep - and I know as much of the ways of folk as you do, traveler.~
@508  = ~I'd think that on a dajemma, the most important task is to find one's own self... not one's land.~
@509  = ~The custom is wise, indeed, though 'tis oft mistreated at present.~
@510  = ~How it is mistreated, Dynaheir?~
@511  = ~*smirk* The rumor is that the young Rashemi nowadays treat it as a jolly excursion and an excuse to engage in drinking and debauchery away from the watchful eyes of their elders.~
@512  = ~Any good thing can be abused, Dynaheir. But there are some who follow the tradition wholeheartedly; I know this because I see it in you.~
@513  = ~A pity, that. Do they not know that the knowledge they seek is knowledge of themselves?~
@514  = ~The circumstances matter little; it is the result that matters. Every day that passes I see in thee more and more the valiant man that thou otherwise would have been delayed in becoming. By that result I judge thine adventuring a dajemma.~
@515  = ~A woman and a sword, they say, maketh a man out of a boy. I now know all that 'tis to know of the way of swords... but of the ways of love I am still ignorant.~
@516  = ~*straighten your shoulders and grin with pleasure* Well, as they say - there is no such ill wind...~
@517  = ~Well, now that we've talked about me... You are on a dajemma yourself, are ye not?~
@518  = ~Indeed, that might well be... but dost not forget - whoever birthed a child doth not hold sway over what that child becomes. 'Tis up to thee alone to be the man thou want to be... And if I may say, with every day that passes I see in thee more and more the valiant man that thou otherwise would have been delayed in becoming. By that result I judge thine adventuring a dajemma.~
@519  = ~*straighten your shoulders and grin with pleasure* Well, as they say - there is no such ill wind ...~
@520  = ~Than thou usest the knowledge that Gorion hath bestowed upon thee well. I was afraid that 'twould lead thee to self-destruction, but thou art stronger than any other I have known.~
@521  = ~What strength is in that, Dynaheir? My sire raped my mother, and she carried me to term. By all rights I should have died, for all the evil that I contain. Yet I know it, and I live.~
@522  = ~I will not be destroyed easily. Speaking of which - we better go, Dynaheir.~
@523  = ~Beware, Hathran. Bhaal's blood is strong in me... I am not as inured to its demands as you have said.~
@524  = ~We have talked enough about my unfortunate heritage. You are on a dajemma yourself, are ye not? Tell me about it.~
@525  = ~Thank you... But he had fallen in battle - the way he would have wanted to die.~
@526  = ~The living concern me more... And thou especially. I look at thee, and I see how a dajemma should affect a youngling.~
@527  = ~I would have preferred that thee hadst not denied me the company of mine countryman. I am indebted to thee for my rescue, and I will fight by thy side, despite thy stubborn unwillingness to allow Minsc to travel with us, but I fail to understand thy decision. He is worthy...~
@528  = ~I know that people would take Minsc and me for lovers, but this is not true. So we would not cause thee embarrassment if that is what concerns thee. My desire to have him near is not romantic, 'tis practical.~
@529  = ~Think on that.~
@530  = ~But I must also say that I do know thy worth as a comrade-in-arms, and that thou art not boasting idly. I look at thee, and I see how a dajemma should affect a youngling.~
@531  = ~*glares at you angrily* Verily, between thee and Minsc there was but one difference - he had a good heart.~
@532  = ~*glares at you angrily* Mind, <CHARNAME>, is worth nothing without a good and sturdy heart to direct its workings. Think on that.~
@533  = ~'Tis up to me to decide whose company I keep, <CHARNAME> and why.~
@534  = ~I know that people would take Minsc and me for lovers, but this is not true. So we would not cause thee embarrassment if that is what concerns thee. My desire to have him near is not romantic, 'tis practical~
@535  = ~Oh, just leave me be!~
@536  = ~For your part - it may not be romantic, but the way he looks at you, Dynaheir... I just cannot stand it.~
@537  = ~Very well, we will get your bodyguard back... Soon.~
@538  = ~I will, at that... But tell me, Dynaheir, you are on a dajemma yourself, are ye not?~
@539  = ~Indeed! *chews on her lips thoughtfully* Yet again thou hast said what ought to have been said. And said it with thy heart's conviction, not as empty rhetoric.~
@540  = ~I look at thee, and I see how a dajemma should affect a youngling.~
@541  = ~*smile* 'Tis not a dajemma for me - becoming an adult can be done but once in a person's life. I didst travel for the first time when I was sixteen, to Saerloon in Sembia in the company of other Hathran. That journey was interrupted by the war with the Tuigans.~
@542  = ~But I told thee of this at length already.~
@543  = ~Something I had discovered led me to return to Sembia last year, and then to come here... 'Twas a long journey, and arduous, but I believe it to be more important than my dajemma. But what a long time we have chattered of me!~
@544  = ~'Tis thy turn now.~
@545  = ~Thou knowest that thou act perfectly stupid? *smiles* By the Three, thy laughter is still boyish, <CHARNAME>!~
@546  = ~'Tis good to hear thee laugh like that - and yet it gladdens me more to see thee when thou act honorably, as a man in his wise years - I see it oft now.~
@547  = ~I look at thee, and I see how dajemma should affect a youngling.~
@548  = ~A worthy thought and an argument put courteously.~
@549  = ~I concede thy point.~
@550  = ~*smiles* Though thou art good proof to the contrary.~
@551  = ~I did not mean that as a scold, and I do apologize for mine heated tone. A man of thy talents should'st strive to learn as much as he can of the world, lest he should'st be blindfolded and ridden like a horse to destinations unwonted. Thou need to know for thyself what is right and what is not.~
@552  = ~And I thought the Hathran did not mind manipulating others to their ends.~
@553  = ~Art thou speaking to Bhaal's son, or to <CHARNAME>?~
@554  = ~I would not believe my own ears, Hathran. I thought it was thy purpose to hoodwink and ride me... for the greater good, of course.~
@555  = ~I like thy words, Hathran. Now - on with exploring!~
@556  = ~So you think I am on a dajemma, then?~
@557  = ~'Tis a generalization - and like all generalizations, it lies.~
@558  = ~Lands art different, and so art peoples.~
@559  = ~Indeed, it is the most important part of a dajemma. And with thee I see it working better than with many a Rashemi noble, who knows naught of the meaning and the purpose of his trip.~
@560  = ~Many a young noble thinks it an excuse to travel far and wide, drinking and carousing, instead of learning of the other lands and of themselves. The true meaning of dajemma is to find thine own soul, to see what thou art made of... and yet so many now forget the meaning and the purpose of the trip.~
@561  = ~<CHARNAME>, with thee I see it working the way it should'st.~
@562  = ~Indeed, but dost not take those who stray for thy heroes. Rebellion is a proper thing for the young, but youthful rebellion is no substitute for knowing one's own soul. And that is the true meaning of dajemma.~
@563  = ~Indeed, I was following the rules... some may even say too closely... when I went on my dajemma.~
@564  = ~I doubt not that thou canst follow this path as sturdily as any other. *takes your hand and traces the lines on your palm thoughtfully* There waits for thee a true love... love that is stronger than grief, that is coming out of troubles and pain purer and brighter - like a mithral blade comes out of the heat and soot of a dwarven forge.~
@565  = ~*smiles weakly* Thou see - thou should'st not worry... 'twill come.~
@566  = ~Indeed. *Her eyes come alight as she watches your face.* Indeed.~
@567  = ~*For a moment, Dynaheir hesitates, but then she takes your hands in hers.* Dost not lose hope, <CHARNAME>. Dark is the stream of blood that courses through thy veins, but thy true heart purifies it... And... I am always near if thou need a heartfelt word of encouragement or a counsel.~
@568  = ~*shakes her head* Only a player canst move pieces on the chess-board, <CHARNAME>... not a pawn. Thou art a fellow player - and I neither can, nor wish to, move thy hand.~
@569  = ~To <CHARNAME> I spake, *the* son of Bhaal.~
@570  = ~Stand back everyone! STAND BACK! Minsc's witch wishes to talk to <CHARNAME> in PRIVATE!~
@571  = ~Squeak!~
@572  = ~Minsc's and Boo's! My hamster stands on guard for you!~
@573  = ~But of course you cannot understand such things, witch, because you are coming from a nation of slaves, and we, Thayvians, are the nation of masters. Do not crack the walnut that passes for your brain. <CHARNAME>, I had never thought highly of you, but listening to a primitive Hathran, when a Red Wizard (and I must add, a superiorly educated and godlike-intelligent Red Wizard) walks with you, marks the new low of human stupidity.~
@574  = ~Edwin... we, stupid simians are so stupid that we cannot even benefit from your advice. Eei! Uuui! EEEI! *You start jumping around, scratching your armpits and slapping your bum in an imitation of a monkey, until Edwin moves away indignant.*~
@575  = ~I am so tired of you two bickering... *sigh* Today is Dynaheir's day, Edwin. Tomorrow you will have my ear.~
@576  = ~You know, Dynaheir, Edwin is right. We have talked enough for today. I'd chat with Edwin now.~
@577  = ~I will not mingle with the witch again, Edwin. I treasure your opinion of me too much.~
@578  = ~*smiles thinly* Glorious Thay would yet rule the world... even if it would take millennia.~
@579  = ~Glorious Dynaheir is under my protection!~
@580  = ~I doubt that <CHARNAME> hast missed out on that, Minsc. Stand easy, my friend, for I can take care of myself in such matters.~
@581  = ~I remember how I set out on this journey, <CHARNAME>, so eager to complete the studies I started when I was on my dajemma. It seems like a long time had passed since the Othlor permitted me to leave my position of a Keeper of Manuscripts with the Fyrra of Urlaunt, but in truth it had been only two years today. But eventful years.~
@582  = ~Is Fyrra a local lord, Dynaheir?~
@583  = ~*smile* Othlor judged wisely... the Fyrra of Urlaunt can find another Keeper, but <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep needs Dynaheir by his side.~
@584  = ~Something I was wondering about, lady Dynaheir - since Minsc is on his own dajemma, he did not accompany you when you went to Sembia, right? Then how did you meet him?~
@585  = ~What lands didst thou pass, Hathran?~
@586  = ~Thy studies, Dynaheir - why wert they interrupted in the first place? I thought that a Hathran's dajemma lasts as long as it must.~
@587  = ~Indeed, Fyrra is a local war leader who is entrusted with the defense of a settlement.~
@588  = ~*smile* Well, he has to find another Keeper, then. <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep needs Dynaheir by his side.~
@589  = ~I want thee to understand that I did not serve Fyrra, but I did my duty to my people - and so I do here even now. Hathran dost not hire out for a time - they always serve Rashemen. To thee I have a blood debt, for thou hast saved mine life. I would stay by thy side for as long as thou require - but my first loyalty is to my country.~
@590  = ~*unpleasantly* And if an Othlor would demand my head, thou wouldst deliver it?~
@591  = ~Rashemen is many days away from here, even as a bird flies, let alone as a man walks. And here I am, the man who had delivered you from thralldom and the horrors of imprisonment - and yet you refuse to pledge your fealty. This sours me and makes me doubt your loyalty.~
@592  = ~It is always good to know which companions have goals of their own, and do not stand squarely behind me.~
@593  = ~Blood debt? Is that all that bonds us, Dynaheir?~
@594  = ~In every song I know, the hero who saves a gentle maiden marries her... expect for in bawdy verses, of course. You, my not-so-gentle prize, instead of trembling prettily with ill-concealed passion when you see me, throw fireballs. Ah, at least they are *usually* directed at my foes. *teasingly* I ought to make a song of it. 
All the maidens fair
are garden roses white
but the one in my care
is a red rose o'wild... 
~
@595  = ~I had passed through a small settlement while taking the Golden Way to Thesk. We both started out of Rashemen at about the same time, and he was looking for a companion. 'Twas not easy for him to find one - due to his condition. I myself was uncomfortable with it, but the man hath a true heart, despite lacking sharpness of mind. And he came with me to Sembia, so I did not travel alone this time.~
@596  = ~*smile* <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep needs Minsc by his side... and Dynaheir. The Fyrras can find other berserkers and witches to serve them for now.~
@597  = ~So, thou went to Sembia. What other lands didst thou pass, Hathran?~
@598  = ~Thou went to Sembia once more? Thy studies, Dynaheir - why wert they interrupted in the first place? I thought that a Hathran's dajemma lasts as long as it must.~
@599  = ~This journey was shorter than my first one. I rode down the Golden Way to the port of Telfamar in Thesk and sailed to Saerloon. And there, after studying with a friend of mine in the Temple of Mystra, I bought passage across the Dragonmere to Westgate.~
@600  = ~Where were you planning to go from there, Dynaheir?~
@601  = ~I assume that you were interested in visiting Candlekeep. You could have run across me there... had things turned out differently.~
@602  = ~A friend of yours? Is she a nice girl, with her nose in a book, just like you?~
@603  = ~Ah, I see. So what about your dajemma? Did you only travel to Sembia?~
@604  = ~Well, now I know. You should tell me more one of these days, but not now. Let us move.~
@605  = ~I went on my dajemma during the times of unrest shortly after the Time of Troubles. Alas, while mine sisters and I toured the Sea of Fallen Stars, it became known that the Tuigans invaded out of the Steppes. Unable to come to the aid of our native Rashemen we volunteered for King Azoun's crusade to fight the horde, to do our part in keeping the realms safe.~
@606  = ~Afterwards mine companions turned to Sembia... and it was hinted that my dajemma was fulfilled. Yet I was stubborn and chose to continue travelling with the group, as I felt my dajemma had not yet concluded. The Hathran suggested that I apply myself to studying the scrolls in temples of Mystra and Azuth of Saerloon, which I did with great eagerness. There I also found a wonderful study companion and was quite pleased.~
@607  = ~What I did not know, however, was that mine companions wert engaged into secret negotiations to oust Thay agents from Saerloon. Unfortunately, their activity was betrayed to Thayvians, and after one sister was waylaid and killed, we were ordered to return to Rashemen.~
@608  = ~So you returned to Sembia and finished your research this time. Where were you planning to go from there, Dynaheir?~
@609  = ~*smile* This time, you traveled alone to make sure that nothing would impede your studies. Were you interested in visiting Candlekeep after leaving Saerloon? You could have run across me there, had things turned out differently.~
@610  = ~*She musses up your hair.* This head stays where it is, if I can help it.~
@611  = ~Unless...~

@613  = ~*You give Dynaheir a lopsided smile.* Unless I go mad and start slaughtering people by the score?~
@614  = ~*Catching Dynaheir's hand in the palm of your hand, you slowly bring it to your lips. Gently, you place a kiss on her beringed fingers.* There is no "unless" Dynaheir. You want me alive, do you not?~
@615  = ~Well, now I know. We will talk again when we have the chance. Let us go now.~
@616  = ~Do not scold me for mine loyalty to mine land, <CHARNAME>. Only grief can come out of this.~
@617  = ~*unpleasantly* Well, let us hope that no Othlor would demand my head from thee.~
@618  = ~This is indeed a grim subject. Tell me of your travels, Hathran. What lands did you pass?~
@619  = ~Indeed. We... we will talk again... but not now. Let us move.~
@620  = ~I do not accept this. I require undivided fealty from you, wench.~
@621  = ~*coughs uncomfortably* It does bond us for certainty. I would not be guessing at things that might or might not be.~
@622  = ~*Dynaheir looks at you attentively, a clear warning to drop the subject in her dark eyes.* Why, could I not tell thee of mine journeys, of the lands I passed on the way here?~
@623  = ~*sharply* Didst thou just compose it? Thou should hold thine own gift in more esteem than to waste it on an idle joke.~
@624  = ~*Dynaheir looks at you attentively, clear warning to drop the subject in her dark eyes.* Why, could I not tell thee of mine journeys, of the lands I passed on the way here?~
@625  = ~We traveled to Westgate by sea; from Westgate, Minsc and I traveled to Iriaebor, before taking the road connecting Berdusk with Nashkel. In Nashkel we were planning to turn onto the Lion's Way and follow that North to Candlekeep. I had a book of Rashemi folklore with me, a rarity here, that I hoped to use to gain the entry to the library. But we went astray - the rest thou know, <CHARNAME>.~
@626  = ~Heh, Dynaheir, seems to me you cut it short. *Why* did you go astray?~
@627  = ~Yes, I know the rest... and still I have a feeling that I do not know you at all. Tell me more of yourself, Dynaheir.~
@628  = ~Then, thou wert captured by unseemly monsters, and I, the great hero, came along to save thee! Tru-la-la!
The fair maiden I saved
but not a kiss in reward
my rose o'wild me gave
but a spell and a scold!~
@629  = ~Yes, I indeed, I do. Let us travel now, thusly we can supply you with new tales to tell.~
@630  = ~But things turned out as they did, <CHARNAME> - and there is no changing it. I indeed hoped to visit thy home.~
@631  = ~*smiles wryly* *He* was a dashing half-elven wizard...~
@632  = ~A couple of hundred years back...~
@633  = ~So you returned to Sembia and finished your research this time. Where did you go from there, Dynaheir?~
@634  = ~*wipe sweat off your brow and say casually* Ah, I see.~
@635  = ~Unless the blood in thee will kill thee first, and leave naught but a shell called <CHARNAME>. But then it would be Bhaal's head to roll. I hope that thee wouldst scream for it thyself.~
@636  = ~You scare me, witch.~
@637  = ~I... I will not abide such attitude! You cannot *know* such things for sure, and you'd kill me!~
@638  = ~Fair enough. Let us hope that my defenses hold... and as the last resort I will count on you.~
@639  = ~Ah, but it is a sweet death to die by the hand of a beloved. I would not wish for any other.~
@640  = ~*Dynaheir nods curtly.* Thou hadst a plan for this, dost thou not? And thou know that I wouldst not harm thee unless- *She bites her lip.*~
@641  = ~'Tis thy choice if thou will accept it or not, but I will not serve any man blindly and unconditionally. My loyalty to mine homeland and goodness art sacred to me.~
@642  = ~*Dynaheir blushes lightly.* 'Twas a silly thing... the eldest son of the ship's owner, apparently a great lord in Westgate, became enamored with me. He forced his kindness and his company upon Minsc and me for too long. We tried to elude him and took a beast's trail. With Minsc's superb knowledge of wilderness 'twas a good idea, but alas, it almost brought about our demise.~
@643  = ~Another time, perhaps. I am not accustomed to talk at length of myself.~
@644  = ~*laughs* Oh, but if thou art not scolded, thou art like to do things too daring or too unwise... I am but trying to keep thee alive.~
@645  = ~*quietly and sadly* If Bhaal conquers thee, thy behavior wouldst show it immediately. He wouldst not hide his instincts.~
@646  = ~I pray that thy defenses hold, <CHARNAME>.~
@647  = ~*Dynaheir sits quietly for a long time, her brow furrowed. The light wind blows smoke her way and drops a spark on her skin. She jumps up with a shout.*~
@648  = ~Dost not touch me, dog!~
@649  = ~*laughs uncomfortably*~
@650  = ~It doth not become me to be so frightful. I have pondered the visions of past fears far too long.~
@651  = ~*Make yapping and howling sounds.*~
@652  = ~*Pick up a blanket and roll it over Dynaheir's shoulders.* Here, that should keep thee from harm.~
@653  = ~*You gather Dynaheir in your arms and press her lightly against your chest.* Here, let me give you something more pleasing to think of.~
@654  = ~Darn you, witch! You scared the Nine Hells out of me!~
@655  = ~The nightmares will pass with time, m'lady.~
@656  = ~Thou art fluent in the gnolls' tongue, <CHARNAME>.~
@657  = ~*smile widely* YAP!~
@658  = ~What, no scolding for acting immature and cruelly?~
@659  = ~I am glad that it cheered you up. You must harbor horrible memories.~
@660  = ~*You gather Dynaheir in your arms and press her lightly against your chest.* Let me give you something more pleasing to think of.~
@661  = ~An armor of wool?~
@662  = ~*shrug in a non-committal way* It will ward off the chill, lady. And sparks.~
@663  = ~This blanket will not shield thee from a sword or an arrow. But the one who gave it to thee... just might.~
@664  = ~Yes. *cough* Well, you go to sleep, Dynaheir, and I will... er... I promise that no gnoll or other mischief-maker will get through me to you.~
@665  = ~Yes. *cough* Well, you go to sleep, Dynaheir, and I will... er... I promise that no gnoll or other mischief-maker will get through me to you!~
@666  = ~Yep. *grin* Cheap and reliable.~
@667  = ~Well, it worked to make you forget your worries. But if m'lady wants me to help her into mine own armor, I will be delighted to squire for her.~
@668  = ~Thou think'st that thine embrace will make me forget the deep pit I was thrown into? And the heavy stone cover that the gnolls moved to close the opening for the night, shutting me off in the complete darkness with only a trickle of air coming through a thin slot to disturb the stench?~
@669  = ~When thou walked me to the surface, I near fainted, so fragrant the air felt... when 'twas in truth full of foul smells of death and vomit and blood...~
@670  = ~*Smiles sadly, and you notice tightness around her eyes.* I have no scoldings left in me now, <CHARNAME>. I am too... exhausted by fighting off the memories.~
@671  = ~'Twill indeed. If only it would shield against memories as well...~
@672  = ~My brave... I can defend myself against a sword or an arrow. I am not afraid of the present danger or of what the future has in store for me. 'Tis memories that assault me...~
@673  = ~Surely thou art not fishing for a compliment to thy manliness? Thou know quite well that I should collapse under the weight of thy armor! That is why I dost not wander into a battle, plated like a tortoise and mad like a dwarven battlerager, but stay back with my head cool and utter words arcana...~
@674  = ~But some battles art not won neither by the spell nor by sword. I am fighting mine own memories...~
@675  = ~I am ashamed at myself of mine... nervousness. 'Tis not like me to be unsettled by memories.~
@676  = ~*irritably* Nothing hath happened just now. I was assaulted by... by memories.~
@677  = ~*glares at you* Absolutely not! I have been accosted by memories, but I am still as clear-headed as I always have been. And I will chase these memories away shortly.~
@678  = ~They art ever there... I wish that my mind would fail me for the first time in mine life.~
@679  = ~But no... I remember too well the deep pit I was thrown into. And the heavy stone cover that the gnolls moved to close the opening for the night, shutting me off in the complete darkness with only a trickle of air coming through a thin slot to disturb the stench. When thou walked me to the surface, I near fainted, so fragrant the air felt... when 'twas in truth full of foul smells of death and vomit and blood...~
@680  = ~Dost thou think that I can forget those countless days when I occupied myself with trying to devise an escape plan and discounting possibility after possibility?~
@681  = ~To forget that there were things I was frightened more of than of the death itself?~
@682  = ~No. But I think I can... I can help you somehow...~
@683  = ~Talk to me. Sometimes the fears of old lessen, when they are spoken out loud to a compassionate listener.~
@684  = ~They shut you off in that stinking hole?! By all the gods, I'm glad that I killed the whole lot!~
@685  = ~You have survived, woman. Why allow ill memories to ruin a perfectly nice <DAYNIGHT>?~
@686  = ~I thought that thou would be less... jumpy after <GAMEDAYS> of adventuring.~
@687  = ~Has it been that long? Mirtul 1st, and today is... what? <DAYANDMONTH>? Oh... time is flying. I *should* be less jumpy, but I am not. So try not to yelp out loud too often, Dynaheir.~
@688  = ~I... I was not scared for myself, but for you. I thought... something had happened.~
@689  = ~I am afraid that adventuring made me *more* jumpy, Dynaheir. I bet you too startle when you hear a dog yapping!~
@690  = ~*ruffles your hair* Good boy. Now sit! I am going to try to sleep.~
@691  = ~I'd rather lay... *wink* or get laid.~
@692  = ~*lick her hand* Will do, my good mistress, will do.~
@693  = ~*snort and say nothing*~
@694  = ~Thou hast delivered me once already, <CHARNAME>. I should not like to grow into the habit of having someone else to rescue me from all mine difficulties. Rest well.~
@695  = ~I shall keep this to such time when I turn into a white-haired and toothless crone, and have no matters of import to attend to but to sit on the doorstep and tell children fanciful tales.~
@696  = ~*snicker* And thou shalt figure in those as a prominent hero, thou hast my word.~
@697  = ~Now, rest well and worry not about me.~
@698  = ~Thou hast done well, and I am grateful to thee for deliverance.~
@699  = ~Rest well now; the deeds of valor art better done with a fresh head on thy shoulders and sure hand.~
@700  = ~Why indeed?~
@701  = ~If I cannot be rid of them all together, I shall keep them to such time when I turn into a white-haired and toothless crone, and have no matters of import to attend to but to sit on the doorstep and tell children fanciful tales.~
@702  = ~Then I advise thee to find thyself a harlot at thy first convenience. *storms away*~
@703  = ~Boo says that Minsc will soon have to find another witch, the way <CHARNAME> never leaves Dynaheir's side. But Minsc does not want another witch! Minsc says <CHARNAME> should find his own witch!~
@704  = ~My witch yelps as often as she needs to! You cannot understand the greatness of Boo, and you do not see that witches work in ways... er... how they work, so... do not yell at my witch to stop yelling, or I will apply my evil-kicking boot to your behind!~
@705  = ~Ah, but it is not the blanket that defends a fair lady, but the one who shares it with her. A glass of good Tethyrian wine also helps when the maiden is cool.~
@706  = ~Dost thou remember the Year of Shadows, also known as the Time of Troubles?~
@707  = ~Thou wert born in its wake.~
@708  = ~Dynaheir, can we talk about something else? ANYTHING! Please... I am tired of hearing of Bane, Myrkul, Tablets of Fate and Bhaal's foresight!~
@709  = ~I was a boy of eleven years in the Year of Shadows, even if I claimed that I was almost a man grown back then. I have no more idea of the Time of Troubles than a man who stays in his basement has of a thunderstorm. He hears a thunderclap, but he is not soaked through by the rain, the lightning bolts and hail pass him by... Gorion was not eager to talk about it... now I know why. I... I would welcome your account of events, Dynaheir.~
@710  = ~Ah, it was some human gods' squabble. Obviously, I should be taking interest in it since my sire proved to be one of them, but I could never interest myself in it. Yet from your lips, my sweet Dynaheir, any tale is welcome. Let it be the tale of the Year of Shadows to<DAYNIGHT>.~
@711  = ~I was young in the Year of Shadows and isolated from the world. I have no more idea of the Time of Troubles than a man who stays in his basement has of a thunderstorm. He hears a thunderclap, but he is not soaked through by the rain, the lightning bolts and hail pass him by... Gorion was not eager to talk about it... now I know why. I... I would welcome your account of events, Dynaheir.~
@712  = ~I was in Candlekeep back then, the place full of sages and wizards. They did not tell me much, but I could smell their fear. That is how I remember the Time of Troubles.~
@713  = ~Of course I remember the Time of Troubles! I was more powerful than Gorion back then, thanks to my magic blood! Go me!~
@714  = ~Of course I remember the Time of Troubles... The Weave was left unattended, and mages could not access it. Without release, it flooded those of my ilk, and I ached all over and felt that my blood was slow and cold by periods, thickened by magic, and surging with mad outbursts at other times... I almost opened my veins to release it, Dynaheir.~
@715  = ~Yes, I remember the Year of Shadows. What of it?~
@716  = ~It was a time of the crisis of faith, but we were rewarded for our devotion. For after the storm had passed, we were granted the true ability to serve a deity's greatness...~
@717  = ~Chauntea herself was distraught in this evil year. Odd beings spawned into the world from her womb, storms roamed the seas and wild winds blew across the lands. I was young then, but the upset of the balance hurt my soul...~
@718  = ~Dost thou remember the Godswar?~
@719  = ~I guess... I do, but I am not very interested in it.~
@720  = ~I was a boy of eleven years in the Year of Shadows, even if I claimed that I was almost a man grown back then. I have no more idea of the Time of Troubles than a man who stays in his basement has of a thunderstorm.

He hears a thunderclap, but he is not soaked through by the rain, the lightning bolts and hail pass him by... I would welcome your account of events, Dynaheir.~
@723  = ~That is why I disapprove of thy mentor for never telling thee the truth. He should have prepared thee better for the challenges of thy heritage. Not unlike how they wean Princes upon the land's custom and his duty for him to grow into a King - and thy duty is harder than that of a Prince.~
@724  = ~Are you trying to correct his failings in a single week? Give it a rest, Dynaheir! I know enough of the Time of Troubles as is.~
@725  = ~*sigh* My duty... of course. Well, tell me of the Times of Troubles, then.~
@726  = ~Thou invented a man that is not me, Dynaheir. Thou bestowed all sorts of qualities and duties onto him, and by some reason thou insist now that this man is me. That's untrue.~
@727  = ~In the year 1358 in Dale Reckoning, Bane and Myrkul stole the Tablets of Fate from Lord Ao.~
@728  = ~Er... Dynaheir, I know all that. Let us return to our travels.~
@729  = ~And the Tablets of Fate are... ?~
@730  = ~And that is why Lord Ao cast the gods into mortal bodies... until such time as the Tablets were recovered. Thus started the War of the Avatars.~
@731  = ~I recall that Labelas Enoreth did not stay impartial to the "human" gods' squabble. So the tale should'st touch even thy proud heart, elf. In the year 1358 in Dale Reckoning, Bane and Myrkul stole the Tablets of Fate from Lord Ao.~
@732  = ~Er... Dynaheir, I know all that. Let us return to our travels.~
@733  = ~Now, how did Labelas manage to distinguish himself so?~
@734  = ~Ah, now I recall that Enoreth clashed with Silverbeard at Ruathym. But truly, Dynaheir, I think that Vartan Hai Sylvar and you are the only two people to remember the matter!~
@735  = ~Indeed, 'twas a time when the most ancient fear of all came to life - a world without order. It all started when in the year 1358 in Dale Reckoning, Bane and Myrkul stole the Tablets of Fate from Lord Ao.~
@736  = ~As a traditional student of the Art, I know not how thou felt; we, mages suffered greatly in the year when Bane and Myrkul stole the Tablets of Fate from Lord Ao.~
@737  = ~I suppose, but it is all back to normal, Bane and Myrkul are dead, and the Weave is restored. So why worry about it? Let us attend to more pressing matters now.~
@738  = ~I know how thou felt, for I am a sorceress as well. The so familiar world of the Art was changed greatly in the year when Bane and Myrkul stole the Tablets of Fate from Lord Ao.~
@739  = ~Thou remember? Tell me then, what is the greatest thing that changed after the order was restored?~
@740  = ~Dynaaaaaheir, I am in no mood for tests... let us... go fight something, shall we?~
@741  = ~Er... I guess there were a bunch of gods that died... and were made. Is that what you are asking?~
@742  = ~The biggest change, o my learned friend, was that deity's powers from that point on were derived from the fervor and the number of worshipers a deity possesses. Did I pass the test, Dynaheir?~
@743  = ~It was the greatest change that the cataclysm of the Godswar brought to Toril. What other thing of importance has happened?~
@744  = ~The death of gods. It will serve for a long time as a reminder of Ao's power, and that all things have an end.~
@745  = ~If my answer was not what thou sought to hear from me, lady, mayhap thou canst reply thyself, and I will remember thine answer.~
@746  = ~In our parts one such storm broke down the great fleet of Mulhorand, that was bringing war swiftly to our region. Thay was their target, but I still am grateful for the storms, for what Empire would stop with one successful conquest?~
@747  = ~By the virtue of who thou art, thou know well how nature was ruffled in the Year of the Shadows. But tell me, dost thou know of the effect it caused to Faerun's peoples?~
@748  = ~No, Dynaheir, I have but a vague idea about it, since my interests always lay with birds, plants, beasts and stone. Tell me of it.~
@749  = ~No, Dynaheir, and this lore is useless to me, for I have a mind only for things natural. Do not begrudge me that.~
@750  = ~There is no clear division between nature and the divine forces that run through nature. After the Time of Troubles, we the servants of the Great Mother received a great gift. The deity's powers are now derived from the fervor and the number of worshipers they possess - and that means that I strengthen nature through my faith, not just through my actions. Did I pass the test, Dynaheir?~
@751  = ~Perhaps thou art right. I can see a certain danger for myself in it. I will leave thee alone for now and wait until thou art in a mood to discuss such things... if it overtakes thou at all.~
@752  = ~The Tablets of Fate art the records that contain the deities' obligations and laws. Bane and Myrkul thought to increase their own power by stealing the Tablets. Ao, the Lord of Lords, cast down all the gods, save Helm, into mortal bodies until the Tablets were returned.~
@753  = ~Four adventurers: Adon, a cleric of Sune, Cyric, Kelemvor, and Midnight were successful in finding the Tablets and returning them to Ao. Three of that company were raised to godhood in place of the slain gods - Bane, Bhaal, Myrkul and Mystra.~
@754  = ~Other gods had perished as well - Torm, Waukeen and perhaps Leira.~
@755  = ~If I were this Adon, I would be very unhappy - he is the only one who was not granted godhood for the deed! Even that madman Cyric was!~
@756  = ~Wait! Torm is not dead!~
@757  = ~Why was Helm spared?~
@758  = ~So who did what to whom and when?~
@759  = ~But Mystra is not dead!~
@760  = ~Four adventurers: Adon, a cleric of Sune, Cyric, Kelemvor, and Midnight were successful in finding the Tablets and returning them to Ao. Three of that company, excepting only Adon, were raised to godhood in place of the slain gods - Bane, Bhaal, Myrkul and Mystra.~
@761  = ~If I were this Adon, I would have been very unhappy - he is the only one who was not granted godhood for the deed! Even the madman Cyric was!~
@762  = ~Quite right. Thank you, Dynaheir, for recounting the old lore to me yet again.~
@763  = ~Labelas Enoreth clashed with Silverbeard at Ruathym over a misunderstanding and slew Clangeddin's avatar. But indeed, the Seldarine showed little of themselves during the Time of Troubles.~
@764  = ~It was left to the humans to end the Godswar.~
@765  = ~Indeed, the Seldarine showed little of themselves during the Time of Troubles.~
@766  = ~Yes, some gods had perished - Bane and Myrkul, Mystra, Bhaal, Torm, Waukeen and perhaps Leira.~
@767  = ~But mortals were granted godhoods as well. Four adventurers: Adon, a cleric of Sune, Cyric, Kelemvor, and Midnight were successful in finding the Tablets and returning them to Ao.

@768  = ~If I were this Adon, I would have been very unhappy - he is the only one who was not granted godhood for the deed! Even that madman Cyric was!~
@769  = ~*sadly* All things must end. Thou art right.~
@770  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, I have started this conversation, but I... I wish to reflect a while. In solitude.~
@771  = ~As you wish, Dynaheir.~
@772  = ~Please, continue, Dynaheir. I think... I think it is important that you tell me what you wished me to know.~
@773  = ~I think that thou know it already, but I will repeat the lore to make sure. Gods had been destroyed and made anew during the Year of Shadows, until Ao restored order after the Tablets were recovered.~
@774  = ~Do not rush to judge, <CHARNAME>. It takes a greater strength sometimes to reject divinity than to accept it. Think on it.~
@775  = ~True. The noble deity had fallen defending the city of Tantras from Bane. Since he had been true to his duty, Ao raised him as a god again, after the Godswar was over.~
@776  = ~Helm was appointed to defend the Celestial Stairway against all other gods. His power of persuasion, though, was not remarkable, for he had to slay Mystra, instead of avoiding the conflict.~
@777  = ~Bane went to the City of Tantras where He was slain in battle with Torm, but Torm had perished as well. Bhaal was slain by Cyric, who wielded the magical sword Godsbane at Boareskyr Bridge. He also had betrayed his companion, Kelemvor, and killed him, but Ao judged it fair to elevate Kelemvor to godhood and give him the Realm of the Dead. Myrkul was destroyed atop Mount Waterdeep by Midnight, who had the power of Mystra. Mystra herself was dead by Helm's hand, but Midnight chose to keep the mantle and name when she ascended.~
@778  = ~Mystra is dead, killed by Helm while trying to challenge him at the Celestial Stairway. Her servant Midnight wears her name and her mantle now.~
@779  = ~'Twas my pleasure. Remember that the lore of the olden oft come to life in the events of the present.~
@780  = ~<CHARNAME>... *quietly* Thou need a healer. Thou art not hale.~
@781  = ~It's a scratch, woman. I am surprised you even noticed it!~
@782  = ~*give Dynaheir a lopsided smile* It's a scratch... Do not worry about it.~
@783  = ~*cringe* I can go for a while longer without having to drink bitter brews or ask a healer to poke my flesh...~
@784  = ~*cringe* I am... fine. Do not worry about it.~
@785  = ~*cringe* I can go for a while longer without healing.~
@786  = ~*cringe* I *know* when I flaming need to be healed!~
@787  = ~My lady's concern touches me. Or does my look simply scare m'lady?~
@788  = ~
The lady-roses all turn white
At the sight of spattering blood
they're greedy for it nonetheless,
wooing heroes bleeding to death...
but my rose o' wild in bloom
won't fade, but instead she'll fume
And without losing her cool
she'll make me look like a fool!~
@789  = ~Thou art right, of course. I do need respite and cure for my hurts. But how dost thou know it, Dynaheir? I trust that I uttered no complaint, nor acted unmanfully.~
@790  = ~Doth a wound need to threaten thy life afore thou take help?~
@791  = ~Thou art hurting badly... I know it.~
@792  = ~And just how do you know it? Did I unknowingly utter a complaint in a most unmanful way?~
@793  = ~I appreciate your concern, miss D, but I am really fine. As in not hurting at all.~
@794  = ~What came over you, Dynaheir? It is not the first time I've taken a wound.~
@795  = ~Aye, I wish you were a healer, not a witch. On the other hand, then I'd run to you every time I splintered my little finger or bruised my toe.~
@796  = ~Dynaheir! Watch your language!~
@797  = ~And the Dragonmere is a puddle left after the last rainfall! I do not even recognize thy smile... in that grimace.~
@798  = ~O, but thou didst walk a while longer - all this time thou spent on arguing with me. Now, get thyself healed!~
@799  = ~Thou art *half-dead*, thou impertinent boil-brained flap-dragon!~
@800  = ~'Tis not surprising that I have noticed it, but surprising that thou hast not.~
@801  = ~Thou knowest the art of healing, and thou ignore thine own pain. If 'twas one of us, thou would have shown more... skill than that.~
@802  = ~Skill was not what you meant to say, was it?~
@803  = ~Right. Do you think that insulting my aptitude as a healer will make me feel better or something?!~
@804  = ~I do not treat the ones I heal as soulless slabs of meat that I have to put back together. I guess I should not do that to myself, as well.~
@805  = ~I am not overextending myself, Dynaheir. Please, calm down.~
@806  = ~Aye, I wish we could switch places sometimes. On the other hand, be you a healer, I'd run to you every time I splintered my little finger or bruised my toe.~
@807  = ~Is this a scratch? And this? This is not thine enemy's blood on thy sleeve - 'tis yours, and 'tis fresh.~
@808  = ~Crawling - mayhaps, but walking upright... I doubt it very much!~
@809  = ~Then why didst thou not have done it back then?!~
@810  = ~I have seen enough not to feel faint at the sight of blood, <CHARNAME>, mine or my comrade's.~
@811  = ~'Tis concern, then. Thy tender care for my condition and thine attention heal me already, my gentle friend.~
@812  = ~*growl* Then stop whining, woman, and leave me be!~
@813  = ~Ah, I think I know what might both heal me and make you faint, my non-dainty lady. *You catch Dynaheir's chin and plant a kiss on her lips.*~
@814  = ~Whatever you say, miss D. I am really fine. As in not hurting at all.~
@815  = ~I thought so, but what came over you, Dynaheir? It is not the first time I've taken a wound.~
@816  = ~Plus I actually look better with my feathers ruffled, no?~
@817  = ~I would appreciate the tune much more were thy voice not hoarse with pain.~
@818  = ~Thy tender care for my condition and thine attention heal me already, my gentle friend.~
@819  = ~Ah, I think I know what might heal me, my merciful lady. *You catch Dynaheir's chin and plant a kiss on her lips.*~
@820  = ~That's as close to complimenting my singing as I've ever gotten out of you! You must be really worried... but why? It is not the first time I've taken a wound.~
@821  = ~No, thou didst not, and I imagine that thou would topple into the road dust quite manfully as well...~
@822  = ~As for how I know of thy condition... I simply do.~
@823  = ~Oh, no, you can not get out of it that easily! How do you know?!~
@824  = ~O, stubborn beef-witted death-token! I can *feel* thy pain, thou...~
@825  = ~One would sooner fill a bottomless barrel than hear some sense out of thee!~
@826  = ~No... 'tis not, alas. But to<DAYNIGHT> I can feel thy pain, <CHARNAME>... quite vividly. And I cannot stand thy being hurt so badly. Wait... I think I can try something...~
@827  = ~I am not a healer, <CHARNAME>, but if I am the only one from whom thou would accept help... I must at least try to...~
@828  = ~I would not even try to! Thou deserve a tongue-lashing for thy... impossible mule-headedness!~
@829  = ~Indeed, I meant to say kindliness...~
@830  = ~And you think that I am not a kind man?~
@831  = ~Why did you say "skill" then?~
@832  = ~Right. But you thought that insulting my aptitude as a healer instead would make me feel better or something?!~
@833  = ~No... I did not aim to offend. I know that thou art talented in what I consider the most complicated art of all.~
@834  = ~I envy thee the ability to alleviate others' suffering. 'Tis a precious gift. It must be... it must be such a pleasure to hold a hurting comrade and see his pain dissipate under a simple touch... I feel now how badly hurt thou art, I wish I could... *Dynaheir thoughtfully strokes your torn flesh.*~
@835  = ~Indeed, thine own heart is not crusted over and unfeeling yet. Thou dost not allow thy compassion to, and horror at, the sight of blood to inhibit thy work. 'Tis part of the gift, I suppose.~
@836  = ~But I am not trained like thee. I see thee bleed, and as of late I know when thou art in pain. And I cannot stand it... I just cannot.~
@837  = ~I envy thee the ability to alleviate others' suffering. 'Tis a precious gift. It must be... it must be such a pleasure to hold a hurting comrade and see his pain dissipate under a simple touch... I feel now how badly hurt thou art, I wish I could... *Dynaheir thoughtfully strokes your torn flesh.*~
@838  = ~I am worried, not hysterical.~
@839  = ~Dost not mock my impotency, <CHARNAME>!~
@840  = ~I am no flirt-gill... I know better than to imagine that mine attentions make thee feel better. I would much prefer to be able to aid thee in a less... airy way.~
@841  = ~I wish I could... *Dynaheir thoughtfully strokes your torn flesh.*~
@842  = ~Do that next time we meet a bear! Thou would likely find a soul-mate in it!~
@843  = ~How canst thou stand it, thou stubborn...~
@844  = ~*Dynaheir seems to be reluctant to struggle out of fear of hurting you more. Yet her lips are pressed tightly together under yours until you let her go.*~
@845  = ~*Dynaheir wipes her mouth with her sleeve.* I am no flirt-gill... I know better than to imagine that a stolen kiss would make thee feel better. I would much prefer to be able to aid thee in a less... airy way.~
@846  = ~No, thou dost not. Thou look thy best in a clean tunic and well-rested.~
@847  = ~Right now it takes heart out of me to see thee...~
@848  = ~I wish I could take pain away from you. *Dynaheir thoughtfully strokes your torn flesh.*~
@849  = ~*weakly* Now... now that's better...~
@850  = ~Dynaheir, are you yourself alright?~
@851  = ~HOW?! I thought you cannot heal?~
@852  = ~Thank you, love.~
@853  = ~Witch!~
@854  = ~Thou art full of surprises, Dynaheir. Next thing we know thou would tame snakes or stride onward with a greatsword.~
@855  = ~I will be in a moment. I suppose that now I know why mages should not attempt to use the Weave to do gods' work. Mine tutors warned me against it, when it was discovered that I have no talent for healing, unlike many of my sisters. But art thou better my lo... lord?~
@856  = ~I am, thank you.~
@857  = ~*smile privately* Yes, my lo... lady.~
@858  = ~I think we better rest for... for my sake, of course.~
@859  = ~I... I cannot.~
@860  = ~I suppose that now I know why mages should not attempt to use the Weave to do gods' work. Mine tutors warned me against it, when it was discovered that I have no talent for healing, unlike many of my sisters. But art thou better my lo... lord?~
@861  = ~*waves at you tiredly* O, stop this... nonsense.~
@862  = ~I suppose that now I know why mages should'st not attempt to use the Weave to do gods' work. Mine tutors warned me against it, when it was discovered that I have no talent for healing, unlike many of my sisters. But art thou better my lo... lord?~
@863  = ~*sighs* At least thou art well enough to yell.~
@864  = ~If need is great enough, <CHARNAME>... There is nothing a person cannot do, they say... Yet... 'tis quite taxing to do things that one is not trained or destined to do.~
@865  = ~*smile privately* Yes, my lo... lady.~
@866  = ~In my travels I observed that 'tis easy to divulge the most intimate details of one's life to a stranger.~
@867  = ~That comes as no surprise. Truly, people who travel all too often belong to the same adventurous type, so it's to be expected that they have a lot in common and often will take to each other instantly.~
@868  = ~Travelling is a lonely business, Dynaheir. But even a loner needs to talk from time to time. So when we get a chance to finally satisfy that need... it's like the flood gates of a dock opening and releasing the pent up waters... Funnily enough, we all seem to have it imbedded in us to seek approval for our actions from others of our kin.~
@869  = ~Now, you have presented me with a dilemma, lady. I wish to know more of you, yet if your confidence cannot be given but to a stranger... I hope that you will never tell me much of yourself.~
@870  = ~Easy to lie, yes. To boast. To trick... But it is needful to tell things in earnest to a trusted friend's ear.~
@871  = ~No, what sends us away from home is different. And 'tis a different road each of us treads, even if our boots leave their prints in the same mud. Dost... dost thou understand what I mean?~
@872  = ~Not a clue! Your usual nonsense, I suppose. But I like the sound of your voice... so please, continue.~
@873  = ~Perfectly. *smile privately* Thou walk beside me, but what is thy road, Hathran? Where did it start? And why didst thou come this far?~
@874  = ~O Rashemi, I only wish I understood you. Perhaps I would if you told me more of yourself.~
@875  = ~Your graceful foot should have never touched the mud of the road, my lady. I would have carried you in my arms, if only you would have allowed me...~
@876  = ~Thy words ring true. *sighs*~
@877  = ~Dynaheir... you will find a better listener in me than in your loyal companion. More... sensitive. Would you... would you try me?~
@878  = ~I have learned it the hard way, Dynaheir. Often I am scribing my thoughts into my journal and wish for a living word instead of a written one.~
@879  = ~Perhaps you can spin a tale or two that happened long after the fall of Netheril and which concern a wizardess who does not yet rival Elminster.~
@880  = ~I asked you before to tell me more of yourself, and you have avoided the subject. Did you have a change of heart?~
@881  = ~My friend... Thou hast succeeded in showing me in a gallant way that the course I was taking was unwise. Indeed, how else would one call a person who'd open her heart to a chanced stranger whilst keeping a friend ignorant?~
@882  = ~Very unwise indeed, m'lady. Would you correct this flaw?~
@883  = ~I do not know, Dynaheir. The worst betrayal comes from the most trusted friends. The stories about backstabbers are enough to make one wish that he had confided in his enemies...~
@884  = ~Thou just called me a friend... But my friendship is a dangerous thing, Hathran. Dost thou want it?~
@885  = ~Art thou a friend?~
@886  = ~My friendship is a dangerous thing, Hathran. Dost thou want it?~
@887  = ~Yes I am. Always. Do not be afraid to tell me of yourself. I will never use your trust against you.~
@888  = ~Let us call it comrade at arms, Dynaheir. But to none I trust more than the people who walk into the fray by my side. I wish for this to be mutual. So... trust me, Hathran. Tell me of yourself.~
@889  = ~Not really. As far as I am concerned, you are paying off the blood debt to me. It is not imperative that we become friends.~
@890  = ~Yes... *a roguish smile* For now.~
@891  = ~Mayhaps 'tis better that I do not.~
@892  = ~I was just teasing! See how little we know each other! We should make an effort to correct this... Why don't we start with telling a bit more about our past? You go first, since you already know more of my story than I of yours...~
@893  = ~Yes, it is for the best.~
@894  = ~There is not much to tell, <CHARNAME>. I was born in a settlement called Borovsk at the shores of the Lake of Tears. My father was a local warlord - a fyrra. As I told thee before, I was tested by the Hathran when I was five years of age and proved worthy of becoming one of them.~
@895  = ~So you were taken away?~
@896  = ~Have you ever returned to Borovsk?~
@897  = ~I see a certain similarity. I, too, lost my family and was adopted by a mage who taught me everything I know.~
@898  = ~At least, you were allowed to know who your father was... unlike me.~
@899  = ~I walked roads enough to be upset at the muddying of my shoes, minstrel.~
@900  = ~And that is exactly why I wish to be the one who would lift you from the mud to the clouds.~
@901  = ~Tell me of these roads, Hathran.~
@902  = ~I am growing weary of your snapping at me. I'd think that a Hathran might have been taught more courtesy and the way to accept compliments graciously...~
@903  = ~Minsc is a slow thinker, yet not insensitive, <CHARNAME>. Why, with this... rodent, I am afraid he is more sensitive than needed.~
@904  = ~Minsc is... well... Minsc. Now, tell me of thyself, lady.~
@905  = ~You have the right of it, Dynaheir. *grin* Entertaining as it is to chat about your bodyguard, we must go.~
@906  = ~Whatever you say. But we digress. You were going to tell me of yourself, if I am not mistaken.~
@907  = ~Thou feel lonely sometimes, <CHARNAME>?~
@908  = ~Stop looking at me as if I were a peculiar artifact brought for you to examine, Dynaheir. Godspawn or not, I have feelings.~
@909  = ~Yes, I do. In Candlekeep library Gorion perhaps sought to make a monk out of me, a man who knows neither his kin, nor his native land. But I was not born passionless. I have a normal desire to be surrounded by my soul mates, my people, even if they are not of the same blood as I.~
@910  = ~Solitude makes me feel lonely, yes.~
@911  = ~And we, the monsters green of face, should not?~
@912  = ~Only because I look particularly cute when melancholy overtakes me. A true image of poetic sorrow, you know...~
@913  = ~Lonely? Nope. My journal is too blunt. I can write about the greatest deed, and see naught in response but the pages covered with script. But if I tell it to a person...~
@914  = ~But could'st one live without faith in one's friends?~
@915  = ~Yes. Or one simply does not acquire friends. I have resolved myself to such a fate.~
@916  = ~No, and if I had to die for it, I would.~
@917  = ~I would not know, Dynaheir. I never tried.~
@918  = ~I guess. If needed to. But it would be a cold existence. Now that we have established the value of friendship, perhaps we can make the first step down this road. Please, tell me of yourself, Dynaheir.~
@919  = ~I am not a dainty sort, <CHARNAME>. Otherwise I would not have sought thee out.~
@920  = ~Thou art not afraid of me? Prove it then. Trust me. Tell me of thyself.~
@921  = ~I guessed that Dynaheir would answer thus, and I was not disappointed. Still, I wish to know more of you.~
@922  = ~You sought me out... Yes, of course: I am a peculiarity. I was stupid to think that you might... care for me.~
@923  = ~*shakes her head in amusement* Thou art -~
@924  = ~Irresistible. I know. Now that you've finished praising me, do tell me about yourself.~
@925  = ~*sigh* More scorn? I think not.~
@926  = ~No, no, lady - do not tell me what I am! I do so like being an enigma... even to myself. But if you want to chat more - I am disposed to hear the lady's story.~
@927  = ~Yes.~
@928  = ~*Cover Dynaheir's hands with yours and press her fingers gently.* Thou art sad, lady.~
@929  = ~I did return. I was warned against it by the Hathran, yet I did.~
@930  = ~I walked the muddy streets, past the log houses and the self-important roosters on the barn tops, hunting for mine childhood memories. At times, I recognized carved horse-head ornaments, white windowsills or a bunch of stubborn flowers struggling in the dust by the well.~
@931  = ~Lilacs wert in bloom, leaning heavily on the fences, both purple and white.~
@932  = ~The wooden temple of the Three still studied its own reflection in the blue waters of the Impresk Lake; I counted its domes... they wert still twelve, built in the liking of the fabled temple of Kitej-grad, which they say once grew invisible and descended to the bottom of the Lake of Tears rather than be destroyed by the Thayvians.~
@933  = ~'Twas all as I remembered it, yet 'twas different.~
@934  = ~Lilacs and wooden fences? You should have sought out your family!~
@935  = ~What was not the same, Dynaheir?~
@936  = ~It sounds... beautiful...~
@937  = ~I wonder how Candlekeep would appear to me?~
@938  = ~*under her breath* He should have taught thee not to carry thine heart on thy sleeve... but maybe 'twould have been an error, too. The Three help me, for I do like what I see... and 'tis too late to break what Gorion hath built...~
@939  = ~But thou didst not mourn thy sire and felt empty hearted for not knowing him.~
@940  = ~I learnt of Borovsk's devastation when I returned from my first dajemma... None of my family lived, save for the boy who was given to my parents to raise in my stead. He fought bravely by my father's side and was gravely injured - and yet I could not even go sit by his sickbed. Hathran's duty is to all of her peoples... she is a sister to all of them...~
@941  = ~I am sorry, Dynaheir... I am truly sorry. But I think you did recover some of your family... Minsc... is he not your step-brother?~
@942  = ~I cannot believe that you had never returned to Borovsk to see your parents, before your hometown was destroyed!~
@943  = ~Thou art a cold woman... though 'tis not all of thine own fault, since thou wert trained to place thy duty above all things that humans hold dear... I... I do not know how to judge thee. 'Tis best if we discontinue this conversation for now.~
@944  = ~*embrace Dynaheir* I am sorry, Dynaheir, I am so sorry...~
@945  = ~Thou art nothing if not well-spoken, <CHARNAME>...~
@946  = ~That's why I am a bard by trade. *wink* But even the greatest skalds grow tired of their own old tales. Tell me yours, lady... be my muse this <DAYNIGHT> ~
@947  = ~I am many more things besides, I assure thee. I hope that thou would discover it... soon.~
@948  = ~Thou need but to give me the smallest encouragement, my lady, and I shall serenade thee sweetly all night long, and during the morning I will tell ballads of thy beauty, whilst in the lazy afternoon I shall-~
@949  = ~Dost thou take me for an idle courtier, <CHARNAME>, or for a harlot? I must assure thee, that I am neither.~
@950  = ~Thine anger, my lady, is misplaced. I merely-~
@951  = ~Until today, I did not believe in no win battles! But I must concede that this one is.~
@952  = ~Thou dost not credit me with having a heart. I would do the same, should I be in thy shoes. *Dynaheir sighs and whispers.* Truly, 'tis for the better.~
@953  = ~Yes, it is.~
@954  = ~Dynaheir, Dynaheir... the more we talk, the more we are hurting each other. Let us just sit in silence for a while... *you get a hold of Dynaheir's hand and caress her fingers*~
@955  = ~No it is not! I *know* that there is more to you than a hound of your Othlor. You know that I am more than a seed of Bhaal. Let us talk... tell me of yourself, for instance... of your life before you became a Hathran.~
@956  = ~What are you talking about?~
@957  = ~You are mumbling again, witch, and I have no time right now to try to make sense out of it.~
@958  = ~I know it, thy solitude...~
@959  = ~I was born in a settlement called Borovsk at the shores of the Lake of Tears. My father was a local warlord - a fyrra. As I told thee before, I was tested by the Hathran when I was five years of age and proved worthy of becoming one of them. Then I was taken away from my family.~
@960  = ~Oh, stop it. I will not indulge myself in self-pity, and won't let you do it, either!~
@961  = ~But there is more to it, is there not?~
@962  = ~Thy deeds have proven thee a man of honor, <CHARNAME>. Thy race and coloring matters not - the way thou feel and act does.~
@963  = ~*Dynaheir looks at you intently and adds quietly after a short pause.*~
@964  = ~I am guilty myself of expecting thee to be an otherworldly creature I would never be able to understand. Forgive me, <CHARNAME>, for thy kin inspires suspicion and awe in me. I should try to look past the slant of thine eyes and into thy heart instead.~
@965  = ~*A small smile comes to Dynaheir's lips.* She would call thee a liar... unless thou hast indeed committed those great deeds.~
@966  = ~Then thou art greatly to be pitied.~
@967  = ~This sentiment dost thou credit.~
@968  = ~I guess. Now that we have established the value of friendship, perhaps we can make the first step down this road. Please, tell me of yourself, Dynaheir.~
@969  = ~I feel greatly honored by your compliment. Since you have learned something new about me to<DAYNIGHT>, it is my turn - so tell me of yourself.~
@970  = ~Of course. But I have other sentiments that are generally considered a flaw. Impatience, for one... Either you tell me something fun about your adventures, or I am going to go find some goblins to kill!~
@971  = ~Right you are! But I am growing restless. Let us resume our adventures!~
@972  = ~I had the memory of the city, yet it had no memory of me. My father passed by, a strong and likely lad at his heels, and bowed respectfully to my Hathran's gown.~
@973  = ~My mother I dared not seek out. Foolishly...~
@974  = ~It is sad...~
@975  = ~Foolishly... why? There is something more to this tale, is there not?~
@976  = ~Some people stay put, while others fly away from their parents' nest. It was your destiny, lady. And I guess, mine also.~
@977  = ~'Twas... beautiful.~
@978  = ~Thou can tell me if we come there again... I would listen...~
@979  = ~Thou should return time and again, <CHARNAME>, for one never knows when 'tis the very last time one hath seen her own people and her own home...~
@980  = ~Thy eye is sharp! Indeed, Minsc is the boy that my parents raised in my stead. I recognized him when I met him on the road - the wounds he had received defending Borovsk stole his memories and his wit. But... he is mine brother nonetheless.~
@981  = ~*Dynaheir looks at you cautiously.* 'Tis against the unwritten laws of mine land that I travel with him...~
@982  = ~Thy secret is safe with me, lady.~
@983  = ~To the Nine Hells with the laws! You did the right thing.~
@984  = ~*Dynaheir is quiet in your arms, as if she is indeed comforted. She lifts her head to face you and touches your chin momentarily.* This world hands out grief generously. Thou hast drunk of it no less than I.~
@985  = ~*It is so easy at that moment to tip your head and kiss Dynaheir's parted lips that you do it almost instinctively.*~
@986  = ~And we are both stronger for it. I respect that in you, lady - do not disappoint me.~
@987  = ~*smile at her gently* We should not make a competition out of it, alright? Let us go now, my friend. Perhaps we can save others the heartaches evildoers left us with.~
@988  = ~That is why we should never decline when it serves us sweeter brews. Like love...~
@989  = ~I am old enough to know what thou art doing, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps even better than thou know it thyself. And let me assure thee - no good will come out of it.~
@990  = ~Now, I was going to tell thee of mine early years, I think...~
@991  = ~*Dynaheir looks at your twined hands almost in surprise.*~
@992  = ~Nothing... nothing really.~
@993  = ~When I returned from my first dajemma... I learned that Borovsk was destroyed by Thayvians. Burned to the ground... None of my family lived, save the boy who was given to my parents to raise in my stead. He fought bravely by my father's side and was gravely injured - and yet I could not even go sit by his sickbed. A Hathran's duty is to all of her peoples... she is a sister to all of them...~
@994  = ~Yes, but one flies freer when one knows that there is a place to return to...~
@995  = ~Thou art luckier in that than I am.~
@996  = ~*Dynaheir closes her eyes and sighs.* By the Three... by the Three, 'tis sweet to think that 'tis real... *She frees herself from your arms gently.* We have forgotten ourselves, <CHARNAME>. 'Tis normal for a man of thine years, but I should'st have known better.~
@997  = ~*Dynaheir's back stiffens.* Thou art a commander I would not wish to disappoint.~
@998  = ~Nobly spoken, <CHARNAME>. Know that in me thou hast a staunch ally.~
@999  = ~Look a' the ribbons, 
m' gentle ladies,
I've every pattern
an' color an' length
Silks o' the Orients, 
Cormyrian velvets
purpl' o' Chessenta,
an' Amnish lace...'~

@1003 = ~Khalid!~
@1004 = ~*Whispers something to Jaheira.*~
@1005 = ~My eyes? *blushes* Alright, then.~
@1006 = ~I bet that the white one with golden vines would become you, Safana.~
@1007 = ~Darling, you will never know... unless you try it on me.~
@1008 = ~The suspense is killing me. Let me put it on you, temptress...~
@1009 = ~Phew, you *paid* for it... Maybe later, if the elf is good.~
@1010 = ~O! Look, Eldoth, dear! My mother used to put exactly the same purple ribbons in my hair when I was a girl! Stupid Brilla threw them all away...~
@1011 = ~Yes, dear, I am sure it was awful.~
@1012 = ~Er... lady Skie? Allow me to-~
@1013 = ~Eldoth!~
@1014 = ~Yes, dear?~
@1015 = ~*Her eyes water.* E-e-eldoth...~
@1016 = ~I see. *sighs* How much for the purple one? And don't you dare overcharge me, harpy!~
@1017 = ~Fer yer lady - only five gold, sir. Ya won't find a better price on Chessentian satin anywhe'er.~
@1018 = ~Oh, shut up, crone.~
@1019 = ~A purple ribbon of Chessentian satin for you, my precious flower bunch...~
@1020 = ~O, Eldoth... you are so romantic!~
@1021 = ~Look, Boo, pretty ribbons! Yes, I know you have not met any girl-hamsters recently... Oh, do not be sad. Let us get one for our witch, right, Boo?!~
@1022 = ~I need no ribbons, Minsc.~
@1023 = ~Every good Rashemi girl needs a lot of ribbons to put in her hair to dance at Midsummer Festival!~
@1024 = ~I do not-~
@1025 = ~Ah, the Midsummer Festivals! Minsc misses them a lot! Minsc drank more sweet meads than everyone else and jumped the highest. What, Boo? O, jump over the tall bonfires, holding a nice girl by her hand...~
@1026 = ~Minsc, folk traditions art quite similar across Faerun; <CHARNAME> dost not need to know Rashemi's particularities.~
@1027 = ~Besides, we should let this good merchant lady go, if we are not buying anything.~
@1028 = ~Actually, I find it fascinating! And Boo seems interested. Tell us more, Minsc.~
@1029 = ~I think I should buy a ribbon for you just in case, Dynaheir. What if I were to venture into Rashemen on Midsummer Day? I would be the only man with a girl who does not wear ribbons on my arm. Not good.~
@1030 = ~
Other maidens spend hours
Talking of ribbons and gems
But the wild rose o' mine
Would not hear any of that...~
@1031 = ~Dost thou claim to know what 'tis that <CHARNAME> wants, Dynaheir? Tell on, Minsc.~
@1032 = ~*softly* I thought you wished me to know more of other's customs and histories, Dynaheir. Has that changed?~
@1033 = ~Dynaheir, I wish to know more of my own people.~
@1034 = ~It reminds me of the Midsummer Festival in Rashemen, when maidens put ribbons in their hair to dance and jump over the bonfires with likely lads.~
@1035 = ~Ah, but folk traditions art quite similar across Faerun; I should not bore thee with Rashemi's particularities.~
@1036 = ~Actually I find it fascinating! Tell me more, Dynaheir.~
@1037 = ~I think I should buy a ribbon for you, Dynaheir. What if I were to venture into Rashemen on Midsummer Day? I would be the only man with a girl who does not wear ribbons on my arm. Not good.~
@1038 = ~Dost thou claim to know what it is that <CHARNAME> wants, Dynaheir? Tell on.~
@1039 = ~*softly* I had thought you wished me to know more of other's customs and histories, Dynaheir. Has that changed?~
@1040 = ~Mead is drunk by the barrelful, and the songs of old are sung until skalds lose their voices. 'Tis also a time of betrothals. The weddings take place in the fall, when the harvest is done, and the winter is coming.~
@1041 = ~Mmgh... quite interesting. But we should get moving, and besides, we should let this good merchant lady go, if we are not buying anything.~
@1042 = ~I wish to buy you a ribbon, Dynaheir. What if I were to venture into Rashemen on Midsummer Day? I would be the only man with a girl who does not wear ribbons on my arm.~
@1043 = ~But 'tis more than a season's travel to Rashemen, and should we come there, it would not be for festival.~
@1044 = ~And if I asked you to accompany me? I would be a foreigner in your homeland, you know.~
@1045 = ~Why? Would you be ashamed of my 'lovely' face?~
@1046 = ~You are right as usual. Besides, I can always get you one once we are there. No need to argue about it now.~
@1047 = ~I am getting you a ribbon, and that's the end of it. You can either participate in choosing the one you like, or throw yourself on the mercy of my taste.~
@1048 = ~I would not believe for a second that thou would rather have me chattering about dresses and ribbons than practicing the arts arcana, Master Bard...~
@1049 = ~No, but it would hurt no one if you practiced it with a pretty ribbon in your hair. The one I am going to give you right now.~
@1050 = ~Of course I would not! But on the other hand, right now we do have to discuss ribbons. A ribbon. I would not want to be the only man with a girl who does not wear ribbons on my arm, should we venture into Rashemen on Midsummer Night. So, I am going to get you one, to spare myself a major diplomatic embarrassment in the future!~
@1051 = ~Indeed, why would I want to corrupt my precious mage by getting her ribbons? Maybe it is because I just imagined you with that red band in your hair. It was so delightfully beautiful! But of course I had to weigh in my mind the potential risk that Dynaheir might well spend the whole of two minutes in front of a mirror putting it on instead of studying her scrolls. Then I told to myself: "Wait! You are the man to set that aright! You would go and weave the ribbon in Dynaheir's hair with your own lily-white hands."~
@1052 = ~Ah, you are right. If I had wanted that, I'd have gotten myself a magpie as a familiar and left her for a day or two in some good mistress-seamstress' keeping.~
@1053 = ~I have no need of a ribbon, <CHARNAME>.~
@1054 = ~I think I should buy a ribbon for you, Dynaheir. What if I were to venture into Rashemen on Midsummer Day? I would be the only man with a girl who does not wear ribbons on my arm.~
@1055 = ~If you do not, then you do not.~
@1056 = ~*laughs* Thou art impossible, minstrel! And I am sure that for mine every word thou would have ten to disprove me!~
@1057 = ~Very well...~
@1058 = ~A churlish word for a churlish word. Fair enough trade.~
@1059 = ~I think you have a story to tell.~
@1060 = ~No matter! We should get moving, and besides, we should let this good merchant lady go, if we are not buying anything.~
@1061 = ~A churlish word for a churlish word. Fair enough trade. I apologize for interrupting thee, Minsc.~
@1062 = ~Now, that's better! Please, continue, Minsc!~
@1063 = ~And I apologize in my turn. Minsc is the only one who has not done any wrong. But he still has a story to tell. Please, go ahead, Master Ranger.~
@1064 = ~*coughs uncomfortably* So I did.~
@1065 = ~Then, please, continue. And do not worry, you do not bore me at all.~
@1066 = ~I have not thought of this, <CHARNAME>. Indeed, thine interest is quite natural.~
@1067 = ~Then please continue. And do not worry, you do not bore me at all.~
@1068 = ~No matter! We should get moving, anyways, and besides, we should let this good merchant lady go, if we are not buying anything.~
@1069 = ~I would have no choice but to escort thee. A tender flower like thyself would need a chaperone.~
@1070 = ~You would have nothing of me, would you? Very well then, let us go. I should never bother you again.~
@1071 = ~Blast it! Let's get moving!~
@1072 = ~Of course, I do, o mighty protector. Now, which ribbon?~
@1073 = ~The people of thy race are not shunned in Rashemen as here. My people have heard of half-orcs fighting valiantly against Tuigans...~
@1074 = ~So it's not my appearance you dislike. It's my personality.~
@1075 = ~Then I see no problems whatsoever. Now, which ribbon?-~
@1076 = ~If thou must, I would have thee choose. 'Twill be dearer to me that way. *smiles* But beware. They say that it might tell what thou think'st of me.~
@1077 = ~Mistress Setta, a blue ribbon, please.~
@1078 = ~Mistress Setta, a green ribbon, please.~
@1079 = ~Mistress Setta, a pink ribbon, please.~
@1080 = ~Mistress Setta, a purple ribbon, please.~
@1081 = ~Mistress Setta, a red ribbon, please.~
@1082 = ~Mistress Setta, a white ribbon, please.~
@1083 = ~Mistress Setta, a yellow ribbon, please.~
@1084 = ~I thank thee, <CHARNAME>. 'Tis the color of peace, and a symbol of the infinite, and some say even of the soul. I will wear it as a sign of our friendship.~
@1085 = ~Well... yes. I thought it suited you, that's all.~
@1086 = ~Thou art welcome, my friend.~
@1087 = ~Thou art welcome, my soul.~
@1088 = ~A suitable color for a witch. It means both wisdom and madness, good fortune and bad luck.~
@1089 = ~Well... I thought it suited you, that's all.~
@1090 = ~Indeed, a color for a witch. *You bite off the last word in disgust.*~
@1091 = ~And I have heard it means hope and immortality. And love.~
@1092 = ~Pink?! I would not have thought thee to be a lover of pink.~
@1093 = ~Imoen is a girl. Imoen loves pink. Therefore, all girls love pink.~
@1094 = ~Hey, quit whining! I am trying to express tender love here!~
@1095 = ~I... I never was! You affect me negatively, Dynaheir. It's better that I stay away from you.~
@1096 = ~Didst... didst thou give it to me for a reason or unknowingly?~
@1097 = ~It suits me to leave you guessing, Dynaheir.~
@1098 = ~It means a discreet confession of a deep and sincere feeling... So let us keep it discreet.~
@1099 = ~The color of life and fire. Thou thinkest it mine?~
@1100 = ~It warns of danger and forbids. You did it so many times with me, Dynaheir, that I believed you.~
@1101 = ~Of course. What else could I have given you? Passion and seduction - it holds it all.~
@1102 = ~But I thank thee, <CHARNAME>. I am glad thou thinkest well of me: white is beauty and perfection.~
@1103 = ~I admire you, yes. And you are forgetting that 'tis also the color of beginning...~
@1104 = ~I think well of thee indeed. But white hath a rarer meaning, Dynaheir - the color of ending.~
@1105 = ~I thank thee, <CHARNAME>. We all need joy in our lives. I shall wear it as a reminder of that simple truth.~
@1106 = ~Wear it as a reminder that I still expect lies and betrayal from thee. I have not forgotten that thou hast concealed the truth of my heritage from me. And I never will.~
@1107 = ~Thou art welcome, my joy.~
@1108 = ~Minsc, <CHARNAME> is just... he is joking.~
@1109 = ~Well, if you do not want to marry me, let me at least buy you a ribbon!~
@1110 = ~Am I? Right, right... I guess I am. Dynaheir, you are perfectly impossible... I do not know why I am even trying!~
@1111 = ~*smile* I was. Sorry, Minsc. But we should get moving, and besides, we should let this good merchant lady go, if we are not buying anything.~
@1112 = ~Thou'rt right. We are battle-companions only.~
@1113 = ~It is great fun for all good folk, <CHARNAME>! But the crones always try to find Minsc a betrothed afterwards. They say that no big and strong man like me should be without a good woman to look after him. I had to go to my dajemma before that. A married man cannot travel far from his home, and no berserker is a berserker, if he does not go to a dajemma. I think they would have me wed the first Midsummer after I return. Minsc looks even bigger in his armor than naked.~
@1114 = ~That's indisputable, but how did 'naked' come into this all of a sudden?~
@1115 = ~I think I should buy a ribbon for Dynaheir, Minsc. What if I were to venture into Rashemen on Midsummer Day? I would be the only man with a girl who does not wear ribbons on my arm.~
@1116 = ~Minsc does not understand... my witch never- What, Boo? O, alright! Er... let me just continue then.~
@1117 = ~Ah, if little <CHARNAME> buys Dynaheir a ribbon, and Minsc gets Dynaheir a ribbon, and Boo, too! Then Dynaheir will have many ribbons in her hair. But if you want to take Dynaheir to the festival, <CHARNAME>, be careful of the crones! They like marrying men off!~
@1118 = ~O, I am willing to take that risk. Now, which ribbon should I-~
@1119 = ~Er... I see. Well, I can always get a ribbon, once we are there. If Dynaheir needs one, and all that.~
@1120 = ~And I would be a fool to refuse!~
@1121 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, I thought you were a smart one. But let Minsc explain, then. A man cannot very well jump over bonfires in his clothing. It can catch fire and-~
@1122 = ~O... I see. I think I should buy a ribbon for Dynaheir, Minsc. What if I were to venture into Rashemen on Midsummer Day? I would be the only man with a girl who does not wear *even* one ribbon.~
@1123 = ~O! <CHARNAME> is a mightier man than he looks. He wants to marry my witch!~
@1124 = ~My lord <CHARNAME>-~
@1125 = ~<CHARNAME>, Dynaheir. It's <CHARNAME> to you.~
@1126 = ~Don't you ever 'my lord' me, Dynaheir. Ever.~
@1127 = ~What will my lady Dynaheir wish?~
@1128 = ~Is aught amiss?~
@1129 = ~Thou art my liege lord. I swore to serve thee in return for my rescue.~
@1130 = ~I do not consider you my sworn wizardess. I consider you a friend. More than a friend. I hoped that you did the same...~
@1131 = ~If it pleases thee... Though I see not why thou should insist on such formality all of a sudden.~
@1132 = ~Burn Oghma's scroll! So much pomp for killing a few stinking gnolls!~
@1133 = ~True. Let us maintain this distinction then. You were saying?~
@1134 = ~My lord, I have served thee well and true. Now I desire to leave thy service.~
@1135 = ~Carrion crawlers eat my eyes! But why?!~
@1136 = ~Wh-what?! Why?!~
@1137 = ~Have I offended thee somehow, lady? If that is so, please, forgive me, for 'twas done unintentionally.~
@1138 = ~I have need of thee, but thou may'st go, if that is in truth thy wish...~
@1139 = ~Very well, you may go. Perhaps we shall meet again.~
@1140 = ~Naught but my heart. It failed me, m'lord. It failed me as swiftly and surely as if I were a maiden of thirteen years who had first come to a castle and seen a knight in bright armor, or a learned man so unlike anyone she had seen before. I am in love with thee, my good lord, and I find no remedy for that.~
@1141 = ~It's... it's so sudden... Good gods! What am I saying! Now *I* am acting like a girl of thirteen before her dream knight.~
@1142 = ~And I am in love with thee, my good lady, and have not even thought of seeking a remedy for that.~
@1143 = ~What would you have me do about it?~
@1144 = ~Ouch! That bad?~
@1145 = ~'Tis what they make songs about, is it not? But I cannot make a song. I do not even want to sing a song. I want to marvel at you in silence... to kiss you wordlessly... to-~
@1146 = ~Amiss? Naught, save that I love thee.~
@1147 = ~Ah, I see. There were times when falling in love with me did not scare a girl half-witless. But now, I guess I should get used to it. Thanks, Dad!~
@1148 = ~And I am in love with thee, my good lady, and I have not even thought of seeking a remedy for it.~
@1149 = ~I know.~
@1150 = ~'Tis what they make songs about, is it not? But I cannot make a song. I do not even want to sing a song. I want to marvel at you in silence... to kiss you wordlessly... to - ~
@1151 = ~So I did, my lord. But I overstepped the boundaries of propriety. I have fallen in love with thee, my lord, and I found no remedy for that.~
@1152 = ~And I am in love with thee, my good lady, and have not even thought of seeking a remedy for it.~
@1153 = ~This is not entirely accidental. I have served thee well and true. Now I desire to leave thy service.~
@1154 = ~Carrion crawlers eat my ears! But why?!~
@1155 = ~I believe that my own life hath a dear price, as is common amongst all human beings.~
@1156 = ~My lord, I am most grateful to thee for my rescue, I shall always be. I have served thee well and true to repay my blood debt, but now I ask to leave thy service.~
@1157 = ~'Tis because my heart has failed me, m'lord. It failed me as swiftly and surely as if I were a maiden of thirteen years who had first come to a castle and seen a knight in bright armor, or a learned man so unlike anyone she had seen before. I am in love with thee, my good lord, and I find no remedy for that.~
@1158 = ~It's... it's so sudden... Good gods! What am I saying! Now *I* am acting like a girl of thirteen in front of her dream knight.~
@1159 = ~Ah, I see. There were times when falling in love with me did not scare a girl half-witless. But now, I guess, I should get used to it. Thanks, Dad!~
@1160 = ~No, my lord, through no fault of thine have I come to this resolution. The only thing that hath failed me is my heart. It failed me as swiftly and surely as if I were a maid of thirteen who had first seen a knight in bright armor... so unlike anyone she had seen before. I am in love with thee, my good lord, and have found no remedy for that.~
@1161 = ~It's... it's so sudden... Good gods! What am I saying! Now *I* am acting like a girl of thirteen in front of her dream knight.~
@1162 = ~*with an almost inaudible sigh* Such is my wish, indeed.~
@1163 = ~May I at least know the reason?.~
@1164 = ~I doubt that we shall meet again.~
@1165 = ~Fare thee well, my lo... <CHARNAME>. Fare thee well, <CHARNAME>. I will... I shall watch over thee from afar. That at least I promise.~
@1166 = ~Thou dost indeed. Now gather thyself and bid me a fond farewell, as befits a man of thy station and years.~
@1167 = ~No, I would not. I neither understand, nor support your decision. If you leave now, you will break your sworn oath to me.~
@1168 = ~Will you stay? I love you.~
@1169 = ~*embrace Dynaheir lightly* Fair winds and good luck, Dynaheir.~
@1170 = ~Thou didst not have to, for I did. But 'tis a knot that can be undone only by cutting it asunder. I beg my leave of thee.~
@1171 = ~Why does it have to come undone, Dynaheir?~
@1172 = ~You are right. Go. Perhaps we shall meet again.~
@1173 = ~I have been around for long enough to know that going our own ways will not stop me from loving you. And your dreams would not cease, no matter how far you ran. So why resist?~
@1174 = ~I love you, and you - me. You want to leave. This does not make sense, Dynaheir.~
@1175 = ~Stay. Just... stay with me, Hathran, and let us see what happens.~
@1176 = ~Because thou dost not see the danger, not yet... I beg to take my leave of thee.~
@1177 = ~I see it. I just hoped that we could fool fate. But you are right - nobody can trick the fates. Go. Perhaps... perhaps we shall meet again, when I am more in control of my destiny.~
@1178 = ~And what do you see, Hathran?~
@1179 = ~If you are afraid of me... then go.~
@1180 = ~I want thee to let me go, my lord. If thou dost not love me - do it out of pique. If thou dost - do it out of love.~
@1181 = ~Stay. Just... stay with me, Hathran, and let us see what will happen.~
@1182 = ~Not many choices hast thou offered me, Hathran.~
@1183 = ~Come the morrow, thou wilt understand... As thou wilt understand why I ask thee to release me from thy service. Now gather thyself and bid me a fond farewell, as befits a man of thy station and years.~
@1184 = ~I have been around for long enough to know that going our own ways will not stop me from loving you. And your dreams would not cease, no matter how far you ran. So why resist?~
@1185 = ~Thou see'st much. 'Tis good. Thou dost not need me now as thou didst before.~
@1186 = ~I want thee to... let me go, my lord. If thou dost not love me - do it out of pique. If thou dost - do it out of love.~
@1187 = ~I would not put it so... but if thou wishest... aye, 'tis "that bad."~
@1188 = ~'Tis bad enough for me to ask of thee... to let me go, my lord. If thou dost not love me - do it out of pique. If thou dost - do it out of love.~
@1189 = ~Thou hast put thy wish for silence in too many words, bard. Suit them now, and let me speak. Our love is a knot that can be undone only by cutting it asunder. I beg my leave of thee.~
@1190 = ~Go, if that will make you happy. Go. Perhaps we shall meet again.~
@1191 = ~Very well. I shall stay as my solemn vow demands. I will do my best to serve thee, my lord.~
@1192 = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, but all I want of thee is to let me go. If thou dost not love me - do it out of pique. If thou dost - do it out of love.~
@1193 = ~Because I love thee.~
@1194 = ~For the love of magic, wizards lock themselves in tall towers, exhausting themselves with studies... And paladins die in hopeless battles for their love of justice. A druid gives her own life for her love of all the living things.~
@1195 = ~I wish to protect thee from being hurt, because I love thee. So I must leave thee, <CHARNAME>.~
@1196 = ~No love cometh without a sacrifice. This one is mine to make.~
@1197 = ~Nothing could wound me deeper than thy departure.~
@1198 = ~I rely on your opinion, witch. If your departure will keep me safe - then go.~
@1199 = ~And I wish to protect you from being hurt, Dynaheir. Only, it would be quite a feat if you go.~
@1200 = ~You cannot protect me from afar, woman. Listen to reason, if you are afraid of listening to your heart.~
@1201 = ~You see trouble brewing if we stay together? What do you see, Hathran?~
@1202 = ~It doth, <CHARNAME>.~
@1203 = ~I wish to protect thee from being hurt because I love thee. So I must leave thee, <CHARNAME>.~
@1204 = ~Nothing can wound me deeper than thy departure.~
@1205 = ~I rely on your opinion, witch. If your departure will keep me safe - then go.~
@1206 = ~I feared that thou would say that. Indeed, 'tis the most tempting thing - to stay together and let the tide overtake us.~
@1207 = ~No love cometh without a sacrifice.~
@1208 = ~This sacrifice is mine to make.~
@1209 = ~*sharply* 'Tis not for thee to know. For knowing, thou would seek to prevent. And when one tries to catch and stop the hand of fate, one is dragged through the sands of time, misshaping and breaking what was written. I would not risk thee.~
@1210 = ~*She stays quiet for a few moments.*~
@1211 = ~*murmurs to herself* But is that not what I sought to do?~
@1212 = ~I will stay, <CHARNAME>. Whate'er will be, will be.~
@1213 = ~Sometimes you scare me, witch...~
@1214 = ~I... I am glad that you are staying.~
@1215 = ~Do not be afraid of what the future has in store. We shall yet drink mead and feast in the tall halls! Together.~
@1216 = ~O, no, witch. You know the future... If your departure will keep me safe - then go.~
@1217 = ~Not thee... for thee.~
@1218 = ~'Tis because I have none to offer.~
@1219 = ~*smiles at you fondly* Silly boy. Thou dost not know-~
@1220 = ~That's right... thou would try to protect me... always.~
@1221 = ~*Murmurs something, and all you can catch are 'omens' and 'fate'.*~
@1222 = ~I will... I will stay, <CHARNAME>. Whate'er will be, will be.~
@1223 = ~Do not be afraid of what the future has in store. We shall yet drink mead and feast in the halls! Together.~
@1224 = ~O, no, witch. Seems to me that you *know* that your departure will keep me safe. Go, woman, and stay away from me!~
@1225 = ~Both reason and heart tell the same tale. But they both lie.~
@1226 = ~I am afraid that 'tis now too late to make amends with destiny.~
@1227 = ~An old tale just came to my mind.~
@1228 = ~Not now, Dynaheir, please. It has been a tough <DAYNIGHT>.~
@1229 = ~I am glad you have spoken. You have been awfully quiet, my love.~
@1230 = ~I thought I was the minstrel here and in charge of tale-telling... But I can see how someone would want to talk instead of listening to me. Though, barely. *smile indulgently* Go ahead.~
@1231 = ~A tale? I'd like to hear it, Dynaheir.~
@1232 = ~This is the time for tales to come to mind. The day is done, the meal is not ready yet, the mending of cloaks and polishing armor occupies our hands, but not our minds. Care to share the tale with thy comrades, m'lady?~
@1233 = ~<CHARNAME>, before thou turn'st to thy rest, I would have thee hear this tale.~
@1234 = ~'Tis no mistake that 'destiny' and 'destination' are near the same; a man can delay his arrival, but never avoid it.~
@1235 = ~Remember that and blame not thyself when what thou seek'st to prevent yet cometh.~
@1236 = ~I say, that if fate means for you to lose, give him a good fight, at least!~
@1237 = ~You worry needlessly, Dynaheir. I have been raised listening to the Chant of Unfulfilled Prophecies in Candlekeep. I know the works of fate when I see them, and I know it laughs at our designs.~
@1238 = ~If there is one thing I have learned in my past travels, it is that bad fortune is simply a combination of horrible planning and ineptitude.~
@1239 = ~In olden times, there lived a mighty warlord, Helg the Brave.~
@1240 = ~In the high noon of his glory, Helg and his retainers rode out. They happened upon a witch, who hobbled by the way. The lord reined in his horse, telling the witch to have no fear of him or his mighty companions...~
@1241 = ~"Tell me how I shall die," Helg commanded. "And as a reward, thou may'st have any horse that thou likest. But beware if thou should'st lie to me." The witch looked up at Helg and replied, "The witches have no fear of mighty lords and no use for their gifts. My tongue is true; from thy horse will come thy death."~
@1242 = ~Helg sat silent for a time. Like every warrior, he loved his horse. At last he left the saddle and placed the horse in the care of his retainers. "My friend and loyal servant," he said, "never shall I ride thee again."~
@1243 = ~I have a feeling it was not as simple as it seemed.~
@1244 = ~Dynaheir, I am too tired to appreciate the tale properly. Tell it to me another day.~
@1245 = ~I am all ears, o wise woman.~
@1246 = ~*embrace Dynaheir's shoulders nonchalantly* If the moral is that every warlord should get a wise woman of his own, I wholeheartedly agree.~
@1247 = ~They say in my land that silence is golden, and words but silver...~
@1248 = ~I'd starve in your parts, then. I make money by filtering the wind through my throat and releasing it out of my mouth... in other words - by singing. I know, I should have become a gleeman!~
@1249 = ~Right. Such is the quality of proverbs that for each praising a virtue, another denounces it. How about... "Silence is a virtue of fools"?~
@1250 = ~*Nod your head in agreement, keeping silent to show that you have no desire to speak, ever again.*~
@1251 = ~Quite wise. Why open your mouth and prove yourself a fool, when you can deceive everyone by keeping quiet?~
@1252 = ~So, you broke your silence to tell me that you value silence above all?~
@1253 = ~I know thy spirit is fiery, <CHARNAME>. I love thee for it. But do not let it consume thee. Do not burn thyself for something thou can'st not change.~
@1254 = ~I would not surrender absolutely to fate. Each of us can bargain. That is the only reason life is worth living. Else thou shalt become kin to the elders who cannot walk and so sit by the road and watch until death cometh to them.~
@1255 = ~Fight if thou must, <CHARNAME>, but pick thy battles with care. And learn to recognize when the battle endeth.~
@1256 = ~Indeed, 'tis often so. Yet - do not burn thyself for that which thou can'st not change.~
@1257 = ~Thy guess is right.~
@1258 = ~Helg thought the woman meant the horse would fall on him, or fail in battle, but 'twas not her meaning.~
@1259 = ~Some years passed. Between battles and feasts, Helg was long away. At last, he returned. The lord asked after his horse and was told that the noble animal lay dead.~
@1260 = ~"I should not have heeded the mad crone's words!" Helg cried, and demanded to see the resting place of his steed.~
@1261 = ~He was led to where the bones were laid, on a high hill, washed clean by the rains. He knelt in sorrow, and at that moment, an adder crept out of the skull and struck the lord's hand, giving him a mortal wound.~
@1262 = ~So death came to Helg from his horse, and he was known thereafter as Helg the Foretold, or Helg the Fated...~
@1263 = ~Snakes... I hate snakes.~
@1264 = ~The next time a crone predicts a horse will be my death, I will not approach it without an antidote!~
@1265 = ~Why didst thou tell me this tonight?~
@1266 = ~*whistle* Clever!~
@1267 = ~Thou knowest 'tis not so. *pats your hand with hers*~
@1268 = ~Well, tell me the rest, then.~
@1269 = ~Would you kiss me?~
@1270 = ~What is?~
@1271 = ~Your tale tells me that when fate means for you to lose, it is worthwhile to give him a good fight!~
@1272 = ~I have heard tales like thine, witch. I was raised listening to the Chant of Unfulfilled Prophecies in Candlekeep. I know the works of fate when I see them, and I know it laughs at our designs...~
@1273 = ~Well, Helg should not have gone to look at the bones - it was unhealthy. If not for the snake, he'd have caught a chill on top of that hill or have broken his neck in a tumble or something. It's not 'destiny'! They always blame everything on bad fortune, while in truth it's a combination of horrible planning and ineptitude.~
@1274 = ~Nay, we cherish our bards, and I do know thy talent.~
@1275 = ~But for to<DAYNIGHT>, allow me to usurp thy place and tell thee the tale. 'Tis important.~

@1277 = ~*smiles* Thou art always trying to please me, <CHARNAME>, and I cherish it. Yet...~
@1278 = ~'Tis not that I tire of thy words, 'tis that this tale is one thou must hear.~

@1285 = ~When in love, lady, even a half-orc raises his eyes to the sky.~
@1286 = ~Sword Coast is the *only* land I have ever seen, Dynaheir...~
@1287 = ~Or of the foes that might be training their black arrows on us even as we speak. This starlit land is called 'Sword Coast', my dear Dynaheir. And it is known by that name not because of a distant memory of the battles long past.~
@1288 = ~Thou art a sweet liar, <CHARNAME>.~
@1289 = ~Neither liar, nor sweet, princess. But I love you.~
@1290 = ~Perhaps I should have said - most desirable?~
@1291 = ~Thy people dost have years enough to marvel at every star and every tree they pass.~
@1292 = ~And thou dost not approve?~
@1293 = ~Because we cherish every minute given to us. That's infinitely better than spending the short days in quarrels and wars.~
@1294 = ~In this world, my race faces the winter of its days, Dynaheir. Why won't you humans allow us to pass beyond the mists unchanged and unchallenged by your sprouting culture?~
@1295 = ~I ne'er thought a man would make my heart flutter at his words.~
@1296 = ~And it does? I trust 'tis not fear that speeds it on?~
@1297 = ~You humans never expect any beauty from me. Why? Because my skin is green? Drow are blacker than the cooking pots in the Feldpost Inn and meaner than the orcs. Yet, I have seen humans marvel and sigh after them. They fear the drow, true, but that very fear adds to their fascination. How is it that black skin is more beautiful than green?~
@1298 = ~If it flutters, I say - let it flutter.~
@1299 = ~But not the last, if foresight deceiveth not. And when thou'rt under the unfamiliar sky, thou shalt look up, and thy heart will go small with longing.~
@1300 = ~Since thou hast spoken of hearts, should we not speak more of my heart... and thine?~
@1301 = ~And then I would hide my face in your hair and feel right back at home again. My people, Dynaheir, think that a lover's embrace is a mansion...~
@1302 = ~What does your foresight tell you of events not so far removed? Will you be mine tonight?~
@1303 = ~I admire thee for thy caution, but I would take the worry from thy face. *she kisses you*~
@1304 = ~*You hold Dynaheir and caress her back.* Will you be mine tonight?~
@1305 = ~Dynaheir! I am not kidding! There could be enemies all around us, and you are kissing me? Have you sent your wits back to Rashemen?~
@1306 = ~Dynaheir, I am not a man of barbarian instincts, but if you continue teasing me with kisses, while we are alone in the night, I will stop behaving like an old tree stump.~
@1307 = ~My lady, 'tis becoming increasingly difficult for this man of flesh and blood to sustain a polite conversation.~
@1308 = ~I feel nigh mad standing here, listening to thy talk of love... When I believed myself to be thy friend and advisor, I thought thou might speak to me of thy love for a young girl who had captured thy imagination.~
@1309 = ~I can do that, but would you like it more than... this? *Kiss Dynaheir and caress her back.* Will you be mine tonight, Counselor Dynaheir?~
@1310 = ~You are still my adviser and friend, Dynaheir. That never changed.~
@1311 = ~Be silent, woman. Our foes might be training their black arrows on us, even as we speak. This starlit land is called 'Sword Coast'. And it is known by that name not because of a distant memory of the battles long past.~
@1312 = ~I'd rather you stop expressing surprise and outrage at every turn, Dynaheir. You love me. Learn to live with it.~
@1313 = ~Sulk not, <CHARNAME>. I know but little of courting. I will kiss thee rather than speak more.~
@1314 = ~I sought no fault. 'Tis but that I find it difficult to understand thy people. Where'er I go, humans are moved by the same desires and dreams. Thy people are different.~
@1315 = ~Dynaheir, I was raised by a human. I am an elf only by blood. You should not treat me like some outlandish wonder. Especially if we are to become lovers.~
@1316 = ~Let's not turn this starry night into a cultural debate. I love you. Isn't that enough? Do you have to understand how it happened, and why your lips tremble with desire?~
@1317 = ~I am tired of counting differences. But if you are such an adept of the 'like takes pleasure in like' maxim, let us count similes. We are both wizards, both young, both adventurous and both madly in love with one another... is not that enough?~
@1318 = ~So why are you standing here with me, and not with a shaggy-haired human?~
@1319 = ~I understand. But I thought that my love cured you of both the excessive awe and fear of me.~
@1320 = ~I am glad the night hideth my blush... Thy speech stealeth my balance and my peace.~
@1321 = ~But I sigh after thee. I am surprised, yes, but the root of my surprise is not in thee. Thou'rt a man of many virtues which only the shallowest of women would overlook.~
@1322 = ~'Tis the passion in my heart that I cannot explain...~
@1323 = ~What response can a woman give to such words?~
@1324 = ~None but open arms and an inviting smile... I would very much like it if you did just that.~
@1325 = ~I am sure you can come up with something. You are the smart one after all. Meanwhile, how about this to help you along? *Kiss Dynaheir and caress her back.* Will you be mine tonight?~
@1326 = ~Well, think on that. Good night.~
@1327 = ~*Dynaheir takes your face in her hands and fixes you with an unreadable stare. Her eyes glisten like two dark lakes in the moonlight, holding your gaze. The pause lasts as her warm body is pressed against yours. You realize that she wants you to remember whatever words are yet to be said this night.*~
@1328 = ~Stop tormenting me, wizardess... Yes or no?~
@1329 = ~I... I love you, Dynaheir. I love you more than I have ever loved a woman. And I want you to be with me in body and spirit.~
@1330 = ~It is your chance to prove that your interest in me is not an assignment from Othlors... I know you, Dynaheir. You hold Rashemen's interests high, but you would not dishonor yourself by bedding a man your heart rejects.~
@1331 = ~*Without taking your eyes away from Dynaheir's face, you start undoing the lacing of her robes.*~
@1332 = ~*pull away* I cannot abide your intensity. Nine Hells, I am simply asking you to sleep with me, not give me your life-blood or descend after me into the Abyss!~
@1333 = ~Thou art not a man to rise from the lovers' bed and go about the day's labors as if nothing had passed between us. I am not a woman to lie with a man as his concubine. I will whisper in thine ear even as we lie together. But that will not always be tender nonsense. Wil't thou be strong enough to take it as a sign of love, or wilt thou condemn me as a manipulator?~
@1334 = ~I understand. Thank you for warning me. In this case it is for the best if we remain what we are now.~
@1335 = ~Let us play it by ear, Dynaheir! One cannot know such things in advance. It all depends on circumstances.~
@1336 = ~You know me well. But consider that I have observed you as well, my love. That I have studied the way you kiss and listened to the way you sigh. That I have written a treatise on your ways in my heart. Of all women, you are the one who would never be able to fool me with pretend love. Have no fear of me wrongly mistrusting you.~
@1337 = ~Whatever you do, Dynaheir, I would always remember that the choice is mine and mine alone. Now I choose to seduce you... or try to. What do you have to say to this?~
@1338 = ~Another human thou claimest to be. Yet I have only to look at thy proud jaw; I have only to listen to thy voice or to hear thy breath when thou'rt in reverie or to put a strand of thy hair behind thine ear to know the difference. And even after I dismiss these things, I see that thine eyes do not just tilt, but that they look past me and into the centuries to come.~
@1339 = ~And yet when I say that I love you, I mean what every human means by that. Or halfling, or dwarf, or gnome... or for that matter - anyone who has a heart. But if you are unsure - let me explain. When I say that I love you, I mean that every time I see you, a glad smile creeps on my lips. When you turn away, some sudden sadness grips me. Your words I drink in as if they are water in a desert. And, if that is not prosaic enough to qualify for a human woman... well, I dream of you nigh every night. And trust me, in these dreams we are not walking hand in hand in the blooming gardens.~
@1340 = ~You are repeating yourself, my dear. It is clear that whatever I say or do, my race will always trouble you.~
@1341 = ~So why are you standing here with me and not with a shaggy-haired human?~
@1342 = ~I understand. But I thought that my love had cured you of both the excessive awe and fear of me.~
@1343 = ~Because I love thee, <CHARNAME>, not a shaggy-haired human.~
@1344 = ~The question is not whether I can learn to live with it. I can. The question is, can you come to do the same?~
@1345 = ~*Breathes in deeply as if preparing to dive.* Yes.~
@1346 = ~From this hour, I am thine, my beloved.~
@1347 = ~And I think thee to be a man too honorable to bed a woman simply to prove her loyalty to thy cause.~
@1348 = ~Thou think'st well of me, and I shall not disappoint. Allow me to prove that when I lie with thee, thy loyalty is the last concern in my heart.~
@1349 = ~Actually... actually it's not exactly right.~
@1350 = ~Of course I am! Yes or no, Dynaheir?~
@1351 = ~*Without taking your eyes away from Dynaheir's face you start undoing the lacing of her robes.*~
@1352 = ~*pull away* I cannot abide your intensity. By the Nine Hells, I am simply asking you to sleep with me, not give me your life-blood or descend after me into the Abyss!~
@1353 = ~Allow me to help thee.~
@1354 = ~*In one smooth move, Dynaheir frees herself of her robes, and they fall to the ground.*~
@1355 = ~*She is naked as on her name day in front of you. She traces her body's curves with one hand.*~
@1356 = ~Is this thy desire?~
@1357 = ~Yes, that's what I want. Yes or no, Dynaheir?~
@1358 = ~*swallow hard* Among other things... Gods be good, but you are beautiful. So beautiful I cannot think straight.~
@1359 = ~'Tis for the best then that we do not become lovers. I place no restrictions on my love.~
@1360 = ~By the Three, thou hast finally exhausted thyself! Must I shake thee awake or wilt thou rise on thine own?~
@1361 = ~Other maidens woke me with kisses... and... uh... my wild rose... To the hells with it! Just kiss me, Dynaheir.~
@1362 = ~It is not entirely my fault for being so tired, my dearest. You, of all people, should know that.~
@1363 = ~*smile sleepily* Neither, sweetling. Nest here, and we will sleep the day away together.~
@1364 = ~Do not shake me, wizardess; then I should be stirred not shaken.~
@1365 = ~*Lean on your elbow and kiss Dynaheir's temple.* Was I such a bad boy last night that the wicked witch has come for me?~
@1366 = ~Here is thy kiss. *kisses you*~
@1367 = ~What other maidens? If thou'lt allow me such enquiry?~
@1368 = ~*wink* I am not one to boast about my past victories.~
@1369 = ~To tell the truth, you are the first woman whom I took to my bed.~
@1370 = ~Dynaheir, I was the only young lad in Candlekeep, a place full of mature, intelligent women who sometimes got bored with their studies. You get the picture, right?~
@1371 = ~Imoen, of course. We were of an age and locked in the Keep with old folk.  We have... experimented.~
@1372 = ~O, you would be surprised just how many ladies are ready to comfort a lonely lad who can sing a song or two. I can't be sure of their names, though, love.~
@1373 = ~I, of all people, should have known better yestereve. But what is done is done, and thou hast gotten what thou wished. Get up now. Thy destiny awaits thee.~
@1374 = ~Dynaheir! What have I done wrong?~
@1375 = ~Women! All right, all right, I'm getting up!~
@1376 = ~My destiny can wait, beloved.~
@1377 = ~We cannot while away our days between the sheets, O hero.~
@1378 = ~The illustrious deeds await thee.~
@1379 = ~My destiny can wait, beloved...~
@1380 = ~No deed is more illustrious than loving each other. I suggest we start our day with that.~
@1381 = ~Did you... did you have a good night, Dynaheir?~
@1382 = ~I see... well, there is nothing to it but to get up then. Destiny! Here comes <CHARNAME>!~
@1383 = ~So I am wicked, and thou art bad. A fitting couple, indeed.~
@1384 = ~Yes, let us cook up a world domination plot! Or breakfast.~
@1385 = ~A very fitting one, my love. At least I thought so. Did you... did you have a good night, Dynaheir?~
@1386 = ~You talk too much, lady. I liked it much better when I kept you... otherwise occupied. You surely kiss like no other woman.~
@1387 = ~I think that I have heard enough of thy conquests for one morning.~
@1388 = ~Thou wert a virgin, then. *smiles* I hope 'twas all that thou expected.~
@1389 = ~Nothing. *Thou* hadst done nothing wrong. *Thou* hast done nothing wrong. But if thou continue to speak so, thou wilt...~
@1390 = ~Women! All right, all right...I am getting up.~
@1391 = ~I was impatient last night... impertinent if you will. For that, I apologize. But I expect an apology in return for your rudeness just now. It is no way to treat a lover, Dynaheir.~
@1392 = ~I am no boy to shush into obedience when it pleases you. I am a respected man along the Sword Coast, and I am your lover, lady Dynaheir.~
@1393 = ~Than thou hast learned nothing from my teaching. Destiny waits for no man. Thou might as easily ask a tidal wave to stay its course. Ride it, <CHARNAME>, or be drowned.~
@1394 = ~*softly* Frightening things art happening even as we speak, and thou must oppose them now. Do not tempt thyself to tarry for a woman's kiss when it might prove thy undoing. There... there will be other nights for thee, my love.~
@1395 = ~*A teasing smile appears on Dynaheir's lips.* I would say 'eventful'.~
@1396 = ~And how was thine, if I may inquire?~
@1397 = ~*return her smile* As eventful as yours.~
@1398 = ~It was horribly, horribly bad! The only remedy for it would be a witch's body applied liberally to mine. Right now.~
@1399 = ~It was wonderful, Dynaheir. But you have come to wake me... and I am awake. Let us go.~
@1400 = ~I brought thee some bread with cheese and olives. Dried meat too. Not much of a breakfast, my love, but 'twill have to do.~
@1401 = ~*She looks at you attentively.* Thou speak'st differently today - firmly and fairly. Mayhap, thou art one of those men who mature when a woman cometh in their life.~
@1402 = ~Very well then. I accept thine apology, and thou hast mine.~
@1403 = ~Now we must be away. The illustrious deeds await thee.~
@1404 = ~I will tell thee what thou art - thou art full of thyself. Let the Sword Coast respect thee, for that is what we strive to achieve, but if thou hast a lover, her name is not Dynaheir.~
@1405 = ~There is blood on thy sleeve.~
@1406 = ~Is it? Then it's not mine, Dynaheir.~
@1407 = ~Is it? Most of it is not mine, Dynaheir.~
@1408 = ~*grimly* At least not all of it is mine, Dynaheir.~
@1409 = ~Darn! They do not mention laundry bills in bard's tales! And the washer women charge double for dealing with blood! And TWO times that again for orc's blood!~
@1410 = ~I am glad thou hast noticed. Doth the blood of my foes make me appear stronger?~
@1411 = ~Yes. What of it?~
@1412 = ~How doth the blood of thy foes make thee feel?~
@1413 = ~Enraged.~
@1414 = ~Glad, how else? I only live as long as I am able to crush my foes.~
@1415 = ~Tired, Dynaheir. There have been so many. And I still have not gotten the man who started it all...~
@1416 = ~Nothing. I don't really care...~
@1417 = ~Nothing. I don't really care.~
@1418 = ~And to think that I worried for thee. If thy common sense remaineth, thou'rt truly strong.~
@1419 = ~But tell me...~
@1420 = ~Thy looks mean but little. I would know one thing.~
@1421 = ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, how dost thou *feel* about it?~
@1422 = ~Do not furrow thy brow. I did not intend to scold thee for uncleanliness.~
@1423 = ~I looked at thee, and I thought first that it was thine, and then... then I thought it might have been the blood of thy foes.~
@1424 = ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, did'st thou think on't?~
@1425 = ~Dost thou hear the voice of thy sire yet?~
@1426 = ~I think that my dreams come from my sire, Dynaheir. But he does not hold sway over me neither in the dream world nor here.~
@1427 = ~Perhaps. I am only alive when I drive my enemies in front of me and hear them scream with the fear of their impending death. Me.~
@1428 = ~It has nothing to do with my sire. I like to measure myself against a foe and crush him. Hating them helps winning, so I hate them all.~
@1429 = ~Can one kill in cold blood? 'Tis a butcher's work we do, save that these are neither oxen nor pigs. I must needs be angry to do it at all - or mad. It is for thee to decide whence the feeling cometh.~
@1430 = ~And the one who killed thy father - is it he who angers thee?~
@1431 = ~Definitely. Just wait until I get my hands on his spiky neck!~
@1432 = ~Him I am not angry with. Him I hate.~
@1433 = ~No... surprisingly no. I feel... curious about him. I have a strange need to understand why he has so much hatred for me, whom he has never met.~
@1434 = ~Very well. Dost thou feel anger toward the man who killed thy father?~
@1435 = ~The man thou hast spoken of. The one who began it all - art thou angered by him? Art thou furious?~
@1436 = ~He must be punished for his crimes. I hate him, as I would anyone who had murdered and conspired against others' lives. I am determined to bring him to justice.~
@1437 = ~I understand thy feeling - no one wants to die... not needlessly. *Her face is clouded for a moment, and she shakes her head as if to chase away unwelcome thoughts.*~
@1438 = ~Dynaheir, art thou well?~
@1439 = ~There was a certain edge to your question, Dynaheir. And it looks to me that you did not get the answer you were seeking. Ask me plainly.~
@1440 = ~Seems to me this conversation upsets you, my dear. Let us talk of something else.~
@1441 = ~*sharply* Every man is tired by his labors; a farmer tires of the plow, a hunter of the chase, a bard of his song.~
@1442 = ~Thy fate is hard, but thou must not lose heart. If thou dost, thou shalt die.~
@1443 = ~The Son of Bhaal and Heir to the Throne of Blood hath not the luxury of indifference; he is fated either to die or to kill his kin in battle.~
@1444 = ~Still, I don't care.~
@1445 = ~I stand to kill Sarevok Anchev, not the brother of <CHARNAME>.~
@1446 = ~Sarevok... there is something about him that fascinates me. To kill him would be a pity.~
@1447 = ~Thou dost not? What about thy main adversary, the one who had killed thy father? Dost thou feel something, at least anger, toward the man, the one who slew thy father?~
@1448 = ~Son of Bhaal, Heir to the Throne of Blood! Ignorance is not thy blessing. Think with me, if thou wilt not do so alone.~
@1449 = ~What about Sarevok? How dost thou feel about him?~
@1450 = ~'Tis thy own brother who is thy greatest adversary now. Tell me truly; do not hide behind 'not knowing'.~
@1451 = ~He must be punished for his crimes. I hate him, as I would anyone who had done murder and conspired against others' lives... I am determined to bring him to justice.~
@1452 = ~*hang your head regretfully* I... I do not know...~
@1453 = ~Would not every man who is not a slave in his heart be angered by his father's killer?~
@1454 = ~My enemy is one, though he hath many faces. In every monster I kill, I hate the one who sent it. Sarevok. 'Tis not beyond reason to hate one man...~
@1455 = ~Thy dreams are worrisome, and I am afraid that thou art right - they come from thy sire.~
@1456 = ~I am yet more troubled by thy self-assurance. How dost thou know what giveth thee that anger?~
@1457 = ~What kind of hero would I be, if I doubted every feeling and questioned every decision?~
@1458 = ~Thou speakest truly, Dynaheir. I should not allow my feelings to distract me. My goal is to bring a murderer to justice.~
@1459 = ~'Tis what I have feared all along. Thou art not the only Bhaalspawn, <CHARNAME>. Sarevok is but the first to show. Thou shalt fight amongst thyselves until but one remaineth, as thy father watcheth and swelleth with thy blood. Then he shall take the winner and be reborn. I cannot kill thee, but I shall not stay to see thy death. It mattereth not to me if thou win or lose. Thy sire hath triumphed over my feeble magic and my weak heart. I wish only to be as far away as I can, so that I will not hear of any misfortune that befalleth thee and be tempted to come to thy aid...~
@1460 = ~Thy self-assurance troubleth me. How dost thou know what giveth thee that hate?~
@1461 = ~What kind of a hero would I be, if I doubted every feeling and questioned every decision?~
@1462 = ~NEVER place responsibility for thy decisions in the hands of another. Listen to counsel, but decide for thyself, and face what resulteth.~
@1463 = ~I love thee more than my life, but as thou hast a head on thy shoulders, thou should'st use it. Tell me, dost thou hear the voice of thy sire?~
@1464 = ~Perhaps. I am only alive when I drive my enemies in front of me and hear them scream with fear of their impending death. Me.~
@1465 = ~I do not know! I just do not know!~
@1466 = ~Thou dost hate him, then. What if thou defeateth him and hath a chance to pardon him? Wilt thou show mercy?~
@1467 = ~If I rendered him incapable of doing harm - why not? I am tired of bloodletting, and his death will not bring Gorion back to life.~
@1468 = ~I think he is beyond redemption, Dynaheir. So, no. I will try to send him to treat with the gods the moment he comes within reach of my sword.~
@1469 = ~Perhaps. I feel... curious about him. I have a strange need to understand why he has so much hatred for me, whom he has never met. Maybe if I spared him, he would... explain what's happening to me.~
@1470 = ~There is no mystery about thy interest. He is successful. More than that, he seemeth powerful and grand, and thou desireth to wear his boots. Such power is seductive.~
@1471 = ~What if thou defeateth him and hath a chance to pardon him? Wilt thou show mercy?~
@1472 = ~*Pats you gently on your shoulder.* I am well, dear.~
@1473 = ~*more gently* I wish that I could heal thy weariness, but instead I must contribute to it. I want to know more of this man.~
@1474 = ~Sarevok - how dost thou feel about him?~
@1475 = ~He must be punished for his crimes. I hate him, as I would anyone who had murdered and conspired against other's lives. I am determined to bring him to justice.~
@1476 = ~An answer worthy of a hero, <CHARNAME>. Live up to it, and I shall never worry about thy future.~
@1477 = ~*Purses her lips in one thin line, and a crease of worry deepens on her forehead.*~
@1478 = ~Deny it if thou wilt, but the name Kinslayer will be thrown at thee many a time, before 'tis over.~
@1479 = ~How could anyone call me Kinslayer *before* this is over, and *before* I actually kill Sarevok?~
@1480 = ~Let them. The main thing is that *I* feel no kinship with him.~
@1481 = ~There are others out there... and I will have to fight them as well, won't I? I will do what a man may, Dynaheir. I will try to judge each of them justly, and I will not allow our blood to blind me to the truth.~
@1482 = ~There is no mystery about why thou findest thy brother intriguing. Sarevok is successful. More than that, he seemeth powerful and grand, and thou desireth to wear his boots. Such power is seductive.~
@1483 = ~But do you *pity* him in truth? What if he is defeated, and thou hast a chance to pardon him? Wilt thou show mercy?~
@1484 = ~If I rendered him incapable of doing harm – why not? I am tired of bloodletting, and his death will not bring Gorion back to life.~
@1485 = ~Do not hesitate when thou must decide, but to decide well, thou must ponder every matter of importance at length, if thou hast the time. Thou hast it now.~
@1486 = ~What if he is defeated, and thou hast a chance to pardon him? Wilt thou show mercy?~
@1487 = ~Thou art not like other men, <CHARNAME>.~
@1488 = ~Indeed. As long as thy hatred doth not lead thee beyond thy reason. Ponder this, <CHARNAME>, and ponder well.~
@1489 = ~A noble answer and a cool-headed one; some might even say too cool-headed.~
@1490 = ~Hmm... 'Tis cautious to pass such a complex matter out of the mortal hands to that of the gods. Yet, I can not help but feel that 'tis almost too cautious. Some might say... 'craven'.~
@1491 = ~*Looks at you attentively and mutters something under her breath. You think that you can hear one word: 'blood'.*~
@1492 = ~Silly boy, think'st thou 'twill be over, once thou hast killed Sarevok?~
@1493 = ~*distractedly* Thou art stately to<DAYNIGHT>, my hero.~
@1494 = ~*comb your still wet hair with your hand* You've noticed that I've bathed?~
@1495 = ~Well, I still have skin on my bones, no flame tongues leap where mine eyes should be, and no scarlet tears stain my cheeks. Considering my heritage, 'tis a grace.~
@1496 = ~*gloomily* You have not even looked up from your journal, Dynaheir.~
@1497 = ~Stately? As in intimidating and haughty?~
@1498 = ~My wild rose, I prefer 'dashing'. *Lean and kiss Dynaheir lightly on the cheek.*~
@1499 = ~I got a whiff of it, yes.~
@1500 = ~*gloomily* You have not even looked up from your journal, Dynaheir. I suspect you would rather not look at me at all.~
@1501 = ~Ah, but I added a couple of special herbs to the bath water. There are fragrances, I was taught, that tickle a woman's nostrils and hint gently that a certain man is irresistible. Now tell me, Hathran, did I do a proper job of it? *Drape your arm around Dynaheir's shoulders.*~
@1502 = ~*grin* I guess 'twas too much to hope for two compliments in a row from the likes of you...~
@1503 = ~
My rose wild got a whiff of mine approach
a quickest puff, a spray, a slightest gust...
Another would have blushed with lust
But thorny one is ready with reproach...~
@1504 = ~A grace indeed. I would have called thee 'strikingly handsome', <CHARNAME>, but I did not wish to over-inflate thine ego...~
@1505 = ~The scrolls claim Rashemi Hathran's power to be 'benevolent', if 'absolute', Dynaheir. My heart knows that the sway you hold over it is both absolute and benevolent... Is it not?~
@1506 = ~*stretch lazily* How could it, dearest, if I hear it from all sides?~
@1507 = ~Have I told you that I am the humblest man on the Sword Coast, Dynaheir?~
@1508 = ~But thou art wrong, Ogre. First, I do love looking at thee, and second, *smiles enigmatically* 'tis thee whom I look at as I look into my journal.~
@1509 = ~*You close Dynaheir's journal firmly.* Come, darling, I miss your kisses.~
@1510 = ~Dynaheir! Stop talking in riddles!~
@1511 = ~You've drawn my portrait, Dynaheir?~
@1512 = ~Well, keep looking, then. I am going to my bedroll.~
@1513 = ~I'll have you know that I am no Ogre, I am an Orc... a Half-Orc!~
@1514 = ~But thou art wrong, hero. *smiles enigmatically* 'Tis thee whom I look at as I look into my journal...~
@1515 = ~I would have called thee 'strikingly handsome', <CHARNAME>, but I did not wish to over-inflate thine ego.~
@1516 = ~'Dashing'? If you will - thou art a minstrel, after all. I would have called thee 'strikingly handsome', <CHARNAME>, but I did not wish to over-inflate thine ego.~
@1517 = ~The scrolls claim Rashemi Hathran's power to be 'benevolent', if 'absolute', Dynaheir. My heart knows that the sway you hold over it is both absolute and benevolent'... Is it not?~
@1518 = ~*nuzzles your neck* Ah, yes, 'tis quite appealing. Quite a change from Eau de Sweat.~
@1519 = ~I only wish I could have captured that, as well.~
@1520 = ~I am afraid that, on the contrary, I have been too spendthrift with my compliments on thy appearance. *Glances quickly at her notebook and smiles enigmatically.*~
@1521 = ~I heard that 'twas the minstrels' custom to exaggerate their lovers' cruelty. But in this case, thou would exaggerate indeed; I have just been complimenting thy appearance - almost excessively. *Glances quickly at her journal and smiles enigmatically.*~
@1522 = ~Perhaps I should have been complimenting thine intelligence, rather than thine appearance. *Glances quickly at her journal and smiles enigmatically.*~
@1523 = ~My humble hero... I am afraid that I but feed thy vanity - indeed, I have just been complimenting thine appearance - almost excessively. *Glances quickly at her journal and smiles enigmatically.*~
@1524 = ~'Tis no riddle. For a fortnight now I have worked on this sketch of thee. 'Tis ready now, and 'tis thine. Tell me later, how thou likest it; my mind is on the model now, not the portrait. *She rips the page out and stuffs it hastily into your pack before kissing you passionately, invitingly.*~
@1525 = ~*ruffles your hair* Yes. For a fortnight now I have worked on this sketch of thee. 'Tis ready now, and 'tis thine. Tell me later, how thou likest it; my mind is on the model now, not the portrait. *She rips the page out and stuffs it hastily into your pack before kissing you passionately, invitingly.*~
@1526 = ~I am glad thou know'st the difference.~
@1527 = ~Wait! Dost not move for a moment! That expression... *scribbles quickly in her journal*~
@1528 = ~For a fortnight now I have worked on this sketch of thee. 'Tis ready now... and 'tis thine. Tell me later, how thou likest it; my mind is on the model now, not the portrait. *She rips the page out and stuffs it hastily into your pack before kissing you passionately, invitingly.*~
@1529 = ~*Wrapped in blankets, Dynaheir props herself against your chest cozily. She has been studying an old tome she must have picked up either in town or in some horde.*~
@1530 = ~*The wizardess suddenly shuts the book with an angry snap and mutters an oath...* Thou clouted flea-bitten... !~
@1531 = ~*lazily* Thou called, Dynaheir?~
@1532 = ~*Run your fingers through her loose hair falling on your shoulder.* Shh... it can't be that bad.~
@1533 = ~*Lift yourself onto one elbow.* What's wrong, Dynaheir?~
@1534 = ~It's just a book, Dynaheir. Besides, I know how it's going to end: the good guys will eventually win, they will get married and have a daughter who will become a dragon-slayer... *yawn*~
@1535 = ~*startled* Dynaheir! Your language!~
@1536 = ~...hedge-pig! Reeky onion-eyed measle!~
@1537 = ~Sorry for waking thee. *she kisses your brow* 'Tis frustrating!~
@1538 = ~*Cup her face with your palms and cover it with light kisses.* This should take away some of frustration, dear.~
@1539 = ~I simply fail to understand an old custom... Why would someone prohibit a branch of knowledge to a learner?~
@1540 = ~Whatever are you talking about?~
@1541 = ~There is always forbidden knowledge, Dynaheir. And if one is to believe sages, breaking the rules often leads to great disasters.~
@1542 = ~There is always a boundary one should not overstep, lest disaster strike, so Mystra limited the mages' power. There are good reasons, Dynaheir.~
@1543 = ~Knowledge is power... if you pardon me for speaking in stale platitudes. As such, I am all for acquiring as much knowledge as I can.~
@1544 = ~What are you forbidden, Dynaheir, and by whom?~
@1545 = ~As a man from Candlekeep, I can only say that a serious student should not be forbidden to learn.~
@1546 = ~Whilst I do read for pleasure, now is not such a time. Dangers abound, and thy quest is becoming ever more urgent, and ever more complex.~
@1547 = ~I was seeking to perfect my knowledge of the arcane, and one area in which I was not trained is enchanting plain items.~
@1548 = ~Well, you can pick it up quickly, I am sure. What can be so difficult about it?~
@1549 = ~I have not been trained in these enchantments either, but I hear that 'tis a complicated subject. Perhaps, with time, we could learn together? We could go to Luskan or Silverymoon, if you wish.~
@1550 = ~That could be useful. I hope it did not prove too difficult for you... what with this swearing and all.~
@1551 = ~I see... But what's so frustrating about it?~
@1552 = ~Enough! *Slaps you lightly with the book on your forehead and laughs.* But it doth feel better after relieving one's frustration in such an artless way.~
@1553 = ~*Run your fingers through her loose hair falling on your shoulder.* Shh... it can't be that bad.~
@1554 = ~*Lift yourself on one elbow.* What's wrong, Dynaheir?~
@1555 = ~*sigh* In Rashemen, men and women both can become wizards. Females, like me, are called Hathran, and males, Vremyonni. The Vremyonni's training is no less stern than ours.~
@1556 = ~One thing that is allowed only to the Vremyonni is enchanting various items.~
@1557 = ~Hathran are forbidden that.~
@1558 = ~There is always forbidden knowledge, Dynaheir. And if one believes the sages, breaking the rules often leads to great disasters.~
@1559 = ~There is always a boundary one should not overstep, lest disaster strike, so Mystra limited the mages' power. There are good reasons, Dynaheir.~
@1560 = ~As a man from Candlekeep, I can only say that a serious student should not be forbidden to learn...~
@1561 = ~I have heard that the laws of our people come from Othlor. They are wise, and must have had a reason for such a prohibition.~
@1562 = ~Ah, yes, I know. But I am no Karsus, to aim to cast Avatar spell and wrestle power from Mystryl!~
@1563 = ~How would my ability to enchant a sword or a staff affect the Weave?~
@1564 = ~You know what? I think that you should try it. We are long way from Rashemen, who's here to forbid you?~
@1565 = ~Dynaheir, in life our "wants" often run into our "musts"... or, in this case, “must nots”. Only a weak person allows her desires to overcome her sense of duty.~
@1566 = ~I feel bad about encouraging you to break the rules, but I would dearly like to see if you can make something magical from something mundane.~
@1567 = ~Just once, surely, would not hurt *anyone* or *anything*. And nobody needs to know, but me.~
@1568 = ~Ah, but unknowingly, thou hast made the most compelling argument. Sometimes the old platitudes are indeed the truth, and one must be reminded.~
@1569 = ~Perhaps the prohibition is there to test the Hathran for pride and greedy ambition.~
@1570 = ~I do not see how a stupid veto on making magic items can be a test!~
@1571 = ~We are long way from Rashemen. Who's here to forbid you?~
@1572 = ~Dynaheir, if everyone always followed the rules and did what had always been done, no new discoveries would ever be made. Greatness lies in overcoming the fear of being out of the ordinary.~
@1573 = ~I guess you are right. Well, let us sleep, before you decide to drop the sky on our heads, since nobody expressly prohibited you *that*.~
@1574 = ~'Tis good to be free to learn what thou wish.~
@1575 = ~I do not see how a stupid veto on making magic items can be a respected law!~
@1576 = ~I guess you are right. Well, let us sleep before you decide to drop the sky on our heads, since nobody expressly prohibited you *that*.~
@1577 = ~*with a small groan* In Rashemen, men and women both can become wizards. Females, like me, are called Hathran, and males, Vremyonni. The Vremyonni's training is no less stern than ours.~
@1578 = ~Othlor, yes. *Her eyes turn to the East as if hoping to see someone coming from Rashemen.*~
@1579 = ~Othlors are far away.~
@1580 = ~But when you return to Rashemen, would they not know?~
@1581 = ~Perhaps you will know when you yourself become Othlor, dear. And one does not become one by breaking rules.~
@1582 = ~Dynaheir, I do not think you would be at peace with yourself, if you break the rules... 'Tis just not in your nature to rebel. Wait until you return, and then you might be able to get permission.~
@1583 = ~Just do it, Dynaheir. You can deal with the consequences when you face them. And if...~
@1584 = ~Sadly, 'tis true. *Her eyes turn to the East as if hoping to see someone coming from Rashemen.*~
@1585 = ~Othlors are far away.~
@1586 = ~Dynaheir, in life our "wants" often run into our "musts"... or, in this case, "must nots". Only a weak person allows her desires to overcome her sense of duty.~
@1587 = ~Dynaheir, I do not think you would be at peace with yourself if you break the rules... 'Tis just not in your nature to rebel. Wait until you return, and then you might be able to get permission.~
@1588 = ~Thou art right. *Kisses you and slides under the blankets.* But since thou art the one who insists that I stay away from this heretical work, thou shalt have to work hard to keep me occupied with other things. To help me fight the temptation, of course.~
@1589 = ~I understand, but thy curiosity and my pride would lead me far astray, and for no good cause.~
@1590 = ~*Kisses you and slides under the blankets.* Would not thou help me fight the temptation? I need much distraction.~
@1591 = ~I will do my best! *Slip under the blanket after Dynaheir.*~
@1592 = ~I think that this is a temptation worth giving in to, Dynaheir... *Turn away from Dynaheir and pretend to be asleep.*~
@1593 = ~I understand it, but still I am tempted to break it...~
@1594 = ~Thou might be right. *Kisses you restlessly and slides under the blankets.* But still 'tis a law... Will thou not help me fight the temptation? I will need distraction.~
@1595 = ~*quietly muses under her breath* 'Tis not 'when', 'tis 'if'... *She notices that you have heard her.* With the battles we fight, 'tis not unlikely that some of us will fall on the morrow...~
@1596 = ~And mortality, as ever, is the greatest ally to temptation.~
@1597 = ~Thou hast a high opinion of me, <CHARNAME>. I value it.~
@1598 = ~And thou art right. *Kisses you and slides under the blankets.* Would not thou help me fight the temptation? I need much distraction.~
@1599 = ~*brushes your cheek* I am afraid that I have failed. *sighs* There was nothing mysterious about it; no grand powers came to me, no new insights. It was not worth it.~
@1600 = ~But this, at least, I have for thee.~
@1601 = ~Yet again thou hast prevailed over thy foes.~
@1602 = ~And you'd rather that I did not?~
@1603 = ~*Look at Dynaheir, puzzled.*~
@1604 = ~Apparently, though I am surprised that we pulled through this time, Dynaheir.~
@1605 = ~We fight on the side of righteousness. It's fair that we win.~
@1606 = ~I did not know you were one of those crows who prophesied failure at the beginning of each new venture.~
@1607 = ~<CHARNAME>, thou knowest that I pray daily for thy victory.~
@1608 = ~They say a man is never truly tested before he hath passed through fire and water and fanfare. I think that the test of failure is no less important.~
@1609 = ~Dynaheir, for me to fail now means death.~
@1610 = ~I have been through worse than fire and water, Dynaheir. I have been through the trial of blood. Have I failed?~
@1611 = ~When they put me out of Candlekeep, I felt as though my childhood home had burned. I have opened the floodgate of the Cloakwood mines, and so drowned both men and monsters. I have heard the songs of my deeds sung in inns and taverns. Do I pass the test?~
@1612 = ~Life and age put us ever on trial and ever judge our actions. Give the trial any name: fire or water, fanfare or failure; find it in any event or as the result of many days. 'Tis never easy, but one cannot avoid it. Every step we take is counted. Have I failed yet?~
@1613 = ~'Tis good that thou dost not take thy victory for granted, <CHARNAME>.~
@1614 = ~Destiny may carry the valiant hero to grand victory. Or the brave, noble, and clever boy may lift his father's sword to take vengeance, and find himself defeated.~
@1615 = ~A righteous cause doth not always triumph, though it may give spiritual strength when catastrophe strikes.~
@1616 = ~Catastrophe, Dynaheir? Why art thou talking of us losing?~
@1617 = ~Is the parallel between this noble boy's circumstances and mine accidental or intentional?~
@1618 = ~I can just see myself, cut asunder by my dark foe, coughing out the last bit of my blood and thinking in satisfaction: "At least I died for the greater good." For me, to fail now means death.~
@1619 = ~By the Three, I swear that thou hast heard me wrong. I do not lament thee before 'tis time.~
@1620 = ~I know that, my love, and my heart grows cold when I think of the price of failure now. Thou may not believe it, but the day will come when it will no longer be a matter of life and death. What wilt thou do then? What wilt thou sacrifice simply to win?~
@1621 = ~Why dost thou look so far into the future, my love?~
@1622 = ~Judge me by my current deeds. Have I failed yet to do what is right?~
@1623 = ~I trust that I know the price of each thing I reach for. I trust that will not change...~
@1624 = ~Sacrifice is always proof. Proof of love, of faith, of devotion. Yet, thou art wary of it.~
@1625 = ~I have never turned away from a challenge. To turn is cowardice. And when I meet a challenge, I intend to be victorious and count not the cost.~
@1626 = ~Hero, I stand too close to thee to judge. Even if I could, 'twere better that thou learned for thyself.~
@1627 = ~A man cannot be a judge in his own case, Dynaheir.~
@1628 = ~*coldly* That was a rhetorical question, Dynaheir.~
@1629 = ~You surely aren't making things any easier, love.~
@1630 = ~And I thought women loved winners. *You smile.* Now, I shall ask the hard questions. What would you do, Dynaheir, if I lost? Would you still love me, if I were defeated and broken?~
@1631 = ~I am a Hathran. I doubt not that thou hast heard that my sisters do nothing without a hidden purpose.~
@1632 = ~Dost thou predict catastrophe for me, then? Why dost thou speak of losing?~
@1633 = ~I can just see myself, cut asunder by my dark foe, coughing out the last bit of my blood and thinking in satisfaction: "At least I died for the greater good." For me to fail now means death.~
@1634 = ~Because I would like thee to think of some things of importance afore the tides turn.~
@1635 = ~Which tides, Dynaheir?~
@1636 = ~I am glad to see that thou art confident.~
@1637 = ~And I am glad that thou art glad. But we have talked enough - it is time to return to earning this victory!~
@1638 = ~Sacrifice is chosen for the sake of a greater gain or good. Too often, it is thought to be the only true heroism. Some throw too much onto the pyre, both that which is theirs and, worse, that which is not.~
@1639 = ~I will not, and let that be the end of it.~
@1640 = ~I see what you mean. But maybe if I ask you this now, your answer will help me be more... level-headed when I weigh my choices. All women love winners. *You smile.* What would you do, Dynaheir, if I lost? Would you still love me, were I defeated and broken?~
@1641 = ~Brave men lived before Tethir the Dragonslayer, <CHARNAME>. Not all of them were mourned when they passed into the distant night.~
@1642 = ~It's but a matter of finding a good bard or *wink at Dynaheir*... a clever historian.~
@1643 = ~'Tis true. Thou art not a self-righteous person, my love. I am glad of that, but I could wish that thou wert more confident.~
@1644 = ~I see. Perhaps thou art a tad too self-righteous, but under the current circumstances, I am glad to see thee certain.~
@1645 = ~'Twas never my purpose.~
@1646 = ~If you wish... Well, we have little time for puzzles. Let us move.~
@1647 = ~*You smile.* Now, I shall ask the hard questions. What would you do, Dynaheir, if I lost? Would you still love me, if I were defeated and broken?~
@1648 = ~Let me tell thee a tale that should answer thy question...~
@1649 = ~Long ago, when Rashemen was a contested ground between Narfell and Raumathar, there lived a warlord called Y'gor. He saw the crops burned every year, honest folk murdered in the lords' quarrels or drawn away to fill the armies of the Empires. He was not the first to see the evil in that, but he was the first to act.~
@1650 = ~Leaving his wife, the Lady Yara, to rule in his stead, he rode across the realm, gathering troops. He planned to battle Narfell and establish a boundary for Rashemen. He fought many battles, but even the best cause doth not always prevail. Y'gor was betrayed and captured and his army defeated. When he saw his death coming, Y'gor released his hawk to carry the news to his Lady.~
@1651 = ~The Lady Yara stood on the castle walls, waiting for news of her lord, and when the bird came, but Y'gor did not, grief overwhelmed her. But her heart told her that Y'gor still lived.~
@1652 = ~The Lady Yara called to the wind, praising its might, but scolding it for carrying the enemy's arrows. She prayed to the Lake of Tears, asking it to nurture her lord and husband, and promising to add her own tears to its clear waters. The sun she scorned for stealing the warriors' strength with its hot rays.~
@1653 = ~The Three heard Lady Yara's laments. Night had fallen early that day, and Y'gor was turned into a quick squirrel, finding his way from the foe's camp. As a falcon he flew over the forests, as a wolf he crossed steppes... So Y'gor had come home, through the love and loyalty of his wife. When he had discovered how well she had ruled in his absence, and how just, he forever left the rulership to her, occupying himself with the military matters.~
@1654 = ~Some say, to Lord Y'gor every Fyrra traces his roots, and every Hathran - to Lady Yara.~
@1655 = ~The tides of Fate, <CHARNAME>.~
@1656 = ~Ah, I see. Well, we have little time for puzzles. Let us move.~
@1657 = ~A good historian doth not lie, even for her lover's sake. And indeed, thine accomplishments art becoming grand enough for more than one account to be made of them. The story that would live for your descendants is not likely to be written by my hand.~
@1658 = ~If you wish... Well, we have little time for guessing. Let us move.~
@1659 = ~*You smile* Now, I shall ask the hard questions. What would you do, Dynaheir, if I lost? Would you still love me, if I were defeated and broken?~
@1660 = ~*Dynaheir wakes you, and the haze of sleep weighs your brow. The Hathran looks fresh and rested, however, and her eyes sparkle brightly. She places a cool finger on your lips forbidding you to speak.*~
@1661 = ~Shh. Do not say anything. Just listen. I put a spell on thee, so that my words come back to thee in the moment of need, when thou art utterly alone, empty, and cold.~
@1662 = ~Hathran are battle mages, <CHARNAME>. We die in battles, despite the powers we wield; maybe because of them, for a foe will target the strongest opponent first.~
@1663 = ~'Tis not new for us to die, but no newer than living, of course. I have a small talent for Divination, and it ever teases me. So I looked, before I set out on this dajemma, to see if I had time enough. Or perhaps 'twas a woman's curiosity.~
@1664 = ~I saw my death in the crystal, and I saw that it was connected with thy continuing to live and staying who thou art. I saw that it was connected with my love for thee. I thought at first 'twas a fate that could be averted, but now I know better.~
@1665 = ~The foe who waits for thee in Baldur's Gate is great, but above him and beyond him looms a shadow darker than night. I looked at it, and I perceived how small I am in front of it - an ant compared to a giant. Neither my magic nor my love can ward it off. But one thing I can, and I shall, do for thee.~
@1666 = ~From the ancient times, it has been known that death can pay for life. It is mine for thine, <CHARNAME>. I have chosen so.~
@1667 = ~I wish thee to know this: I am glad to make this choice, to die for thee, before thy glory cometh to its zenith; to give thee time to fight evil, to save lives, to stop armies and hatred. Thou wert born to do it, and I would not let thy future be stolen from thee. My life will give thee strength to survive the torment, and my love will fill the void that an enemy would try to create in thy soul. I will cling there and fight for thee.~
@1668 = ~But it will also give thee time to live. Dost not fail me by turning bitter, foul or unhappy. Do not forget what I hope I have taught thee.~
@1669 = ~*She slides away, and the sleep grabs at you again. When you wake, you cannot be sure if that was a dream; certainly Dynaheir behaves as if the words had not been said.*~
@1670 = ~The secrecy in which you traveled made me suspect that you had sensed our pursuit, Child of Bhaal. Is that so?~
@1671 = ~And why do you need to know this?~
@1672 = ~Yes, I have felt the chase. I am glad that it is over... Shall we fight, not bandy words?~
@1673 = ~Secrecy? I just like travelling at night. Less heat and dust, you know.~
@1674 = ~Who are you?~
@1675 = ~We are studying you and your siblings; this will add to our knowledge.~
@1676 = ~I will tell you nothing.~
@1677 = ~We need you undamaged, silly boy.~
@1678 = ~I find it commendable that you took good care of yourself.~
@1679 = ~That is scarcely significant. What matters is who, or rather what, you are. We find that useful, and we shall have you.~
@1680 = ~If it pleases you. It will not change the outcome. We shall have you.~
@1681 = ~Starry-eyed fools.~
@1682 = ~And the girl, too.~
@1683 = ~Thou art the shadow that crept in the shadows. Thou art more dangerous than I sensed. I cannot allow thee to hurt him.~
@1684 = ~Run, my love, and fare thee well.~
@1685 = ~Dynaheir, I am not leaving you!~
@1686 = ~Do not worry, we can take him!~
@1687 = ~I do not understand... what's going on?~
@1688 = ~*You move to dive through the portal.*~
@1689 = ~Why, 'twas thoughtful of thee to kiss a maiden who asked for belladonna flowers. It hath another name, knowest thou?~
@1690 = ~Dynaheir, are you jealous?~
@1691 = ~Yes, yes. The deadly nightshade - a poison. I was surprised myself she wanted it. Perhaps she is a witch and needed it for a brew. Do you advise me against kissing witches?~
@1692 = ~Hmm... your tone is rather ominous. What is the other name?~
@1693 = ~*You've missed entirely what Dynaheir had said and sigh, staring after Delainy.* Delainy... such a beautiful name.~
@1694 = ~No. But some would say that I saw what price thou place on thy kiss, my lord <CHARNAME>. 'Tis lower than I thought.~
@1695 = ~That was... an accident. I was just stunned that a girl wanted the deadly nightshade, not roses. Perhaps she is a witch and needed it for a brew. So, you advise me against kissing witches?~
@1696 = ~Oh, Dynaheir, she is just a sweet kid. You must know by now that I am attracted to the grace of older women.~
@1697 = ~I advise thee against kissing strangers, who ask thee for a bouquet of a dangerous herb. 'Tis only common sense.~
@1698 = ~Deadly nightshade. Even a wool-headed idiot like thee could surmise from this name that the herb is a poisonous one.~
@1699 = ~Yikes! And I thought she just wanted to set me a challenge, asking for this... belladonna instead of roses. Perhaps she is a witch and needed it for a brew? So, you advise me against kissing witches?~
@1700 = ~*sighs in exasperation* Why, thou art impossible. Still...~
@1701 = ~I see. I suppose 'tis only natural that thou should'st be attracted to someone closer to thine own years and upbringing.~
@1702 = ~Come awake, <CHARNAME>. I sense evil in thy dreams...~
@1703 = ~I... I did not stab him!~
@1704 = ~*With a yelp, you push Dynaheir aside from the flying dagger, only to realize that it was a dream.*~
@1705 = ~*You mutter.* What am I supposed to learn?~
@1706 = ~Thou didst not stab whom, <CHARNAME>?~
@1707 = ~'Tis not important, Dynaheir. Just a nightmare.~
@1708 = ~Mulahey... I saw him in my dream. He was dead... and I could have destroyed him utterly. I just had to drive a dagger right through him. But I did not. I did not even touch the bloody dagger! And then, or maybe because of it, the blade went for my heart, but never reached me. Afterwards someone... something had said - "You WILL learn"... as though I had done something wrong.~
@1709 = ~*Dynaheir clings to you, trying to restrain you before she notices that your awareness has returned. Slowly she releases you and asks in an unruffled tone* What was it, <CHARNAME>?~
@1710 = ~A dagger, a bloody bone dagger!~
@1711 = ~*You ignore Dynaheir, trying to piece together the fading memory of the dream and mutter* What am I supposed to learn?~
@1712 = ~Thou art supposed to learn many things, but 'twould be difficult without the help of others. Tell me what thou hadst seen, and we might make sense of it together.~
@1713 = ~I wish to ponder it on my own, Dynaheir.~
@1714 = ~If 'tis not important then why art thou sweating? Thou art not easily scared.~
@1715 = ~*thoughtfully* You WILL learn...~
@1716 = ~A strange dream that, and ominous. If I were asked to interpret the meaning, I would say that thou wert called upon to commit a blood sacrifice. Yet, thou resisted, and thy punishment came swiftly. Thy courage is admirable.~
@1717 = ~Yet something dark gropes for thee, <CHARNAME>... something sinister. But when the dark seduces thee, it offers rewards and intimidates. Was anything promised to thee if thou had killed Mulahey?~
@1718 = ~I think... I think I can heal now. 'Twas not promised, I just know that I can. Should I reject this gift?~
@1719 = ~I received a gift, Dynaheir. I can drain other people's strength now.~
@1720 = ~Nope, I do not think so!~
@1721 = ~A bone dagger? Tell me everything, <CHARNAME>. 'Tis important.~
@1722 = ~The nature of it is opposite to the destruction that thou wert pushed to inflict in thy dream. I think thy ability cometh from thy resistance to the dark forces at play, not from them.~
@1723 = ~Or 'tis a clever wrapping to make me accept the gift.~
@1724 = ~You are right. Healing is the art that is opposed to death and I will use it to a good end.~
@1725 = ~*shrug* Well, wherever it comes from it is certainly useful.~
@1726 = ~<CHARNAME>, be cautious with such a gift. Destructive magic often consumes more than the caster intended. Ruined cities and lives all around Faerun art the proof of it.~
@1727 = ~Be careful, <CHARNAME>, and do not take dreams like this lightly.~
@1728 = ~It occurred to me as well, but I would not discount thy own strength and thy own good will. 'Tis good to be cautious, but fear leads to paranoia and paranoia leads to destruction. Which is what this... force, perhaps, wished to imprint on thee.~
@1729 = ~*With sudden tenderness, Dynaheir wipes the sweat from your brow with a silk handkerchief that was previously hidden in the wide sleeve of her robe. With a start, you realize that she is fully clothed in that hour, unlike the rest of your companions: she had been watching over you.*~
@1730 = ~Doth evil haunt thy dreams again, <CHARNAME>?~
@1731 = ~Yes, how did you know?~
@1732 = ~The dagger... I saw the dagger again!~
@1733 = ~*You drop your face into your palms and mutter* Just leave me be, Dynaheir.~
@1734 = ~Whatever it is that sends me the dreams, it keeps insisting that I was made. Made... In the dream, I went through the bandit camp victorious, and the voice taunted me, saying that I do not deserve the credit for this victory. Then I saw a statue, my exact likeness, and it was shattered by that same bone dagger from before. I felt its pain... And I heard someone say: "You were made as you are, and you can also be broken."~
@1735 = ~Thy sleep was not peaceful. Even the exhaustion of battle aches and wounds could not explain thy moans.~
@1736 = ~The bone dagger? Did it strike thee again?~
@1737 = ~Close enough. In the dream, I went through the bandit camp victorious, and the voice taunted me, saying that I do not deserve the credit for this victory. Then I saw a statue, my exact likeness, and it was shattered by that same bone dagger from before. I felt its pain... And I heard someone say: "You were made as you are, and you can also be broken."~
@1738 = ~*A cascade of icy-cold water falls on your head, stealing your breath away. Once you come to yourself, you see Dynaheir in front of you, holding a bucket. She leans forward and lifts your chin up with two fingers.*~
@1739 = ~What hast thou seen?~
@1740 = ~Stop this interrogation!~
@1741 = ~If you insist... In the dream, I went through the bandit camp victorious, and the voice taunted me, saying that I do not deserve the credit for this victory. Then I saw a statue, my exact likeness, and it was shattered by that same bone dagger from before. I felt its pain... And I heard someone say: "You were made as you are, and you can also be broken."~
@1742 = ~*You silently wipe your face with a miraculously dry corner of your blanket and pointedly ignore Dynaheir's question.*~
@1743 = ~Thy nightmares may tell thee many lies, but this one thou should trust the least. Thou art who thou art and thine own man. Thou wert 'made' like every other person. And thou cannot be 'broken' differently than any other.~
@1744 = ~And how do you know all this, Dynaheir?~
@1745 = ~'Tis true. I thank thee for talking to me, Dynaheir. I feel much more reassured.~
@1746 = ~Do you ever talk in anything besides platitudes?~
@1747 = ~Our time for arguing is growing short. Trust that I desire what is best for thee, and that 'tis better if I know what thou hadst seen. But if thou dost not wish to tell, I will not force thee further.~
@1748 = ~*Dynaheir leaves you be, but when you're on the road again, you feel Dynaheir's dark eyes turning toward you, sometimes with pity, sometimes with disapproval.*~
@1749 = ~Nightmares art the revelations of our deepest fears. And fears art grounded in lies, be that the lies of others or of thine own heart.~
@1750 = ~I will always be there for thee... *Dynaheir looks surprised that she had uttered these words.*~
@1751 = ~*coughs* Dost... dost thou feel new powers within thee?~
@1752 = ~I think... I think I can cleanse a body from poison now.~
@1753 = ~I can harm people now... the way the undead do.~
@1754 = ~I do not know yet, but once I have found it out... I will tell you.~
@1755 = ~Thou lookest pensive, <CHARNAME>. Is aught amiss?~
@1756 = ~Is pensiveness such an unusual state for me, Dynaheir, that it deserves noting?~
@1757 = ~O, I merely dreamt of bathing in blood. And enjoying it. What could possibly be amiss?~
@1758 = ~I dreamt another dream, Dynaheir. The dagger was not there, and I was not killed, yet it had the same feel to it as the other nightmares.~
@1759 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, but the red that rims thine eyes worries me.~
@1760 = ~I... I appreciate your concern.~
@1761 = ~*shrug* It's nothing out of the ordinary, so do not worry.~
@1762 = ~I dreamt another dream, Dynaheir. The dagger was not there, and I was not killed, yet it had the same feel to it as the other nightmares...~
@1763 = ~Would thou tell me more?~
@1764 = ~It is difficult to describe, Dynaheir. The world was flooded in blood, and I was thrown about in its torrent. Somehow I felt that I was in my own element.~
@1765 = ~'Twas a scary dream, Dynaheir. I saw blood, it was pouring out of every orifice of the world, and it swept everything away. And I rode the tide of blood and enjoyed every moment. A bad omen, that.~
@1766 = ~It was quite an exciting dream actually. Rivers frothing with blood and flooding the shores, then the whole world. And I was right in the middle of it. It was a lot of fun, now that I think of it. Well, at least, compared to all the other dreams.~
@1767 = ~Thou canst alleviate it, if thou tells me what ails thee.~
@1768 = ~*shrug* Nothing in particular, do not worry.~
@1769 = ~O, I merely dreamt of bathing in blood. And enjoyed it.~
@1770 = ~As thou wish. *She hesitates, then asks stubbornly* 'Twasn't one of thy nightmares?~
@1771 = ~No.~
@1772 = ~Does anything ever elude thee, Hathran?~
@1773 = ~I am not sure. I dreamt of myself bathing in blood, that was all.~
@1774 = ~But now, in the waking world, dost thou accept that blood is thine element?~
@1775 = ~I do not know. I try to think about what these dreams mean - and I cannot find the answer.~
@1776 = ~No, I do not believe blood is my natural element, nor do I take pleasure in the spilling of blood.~
@1777 = ~Yes, of course it is. I rarely go for an hour before my clothes are stained from the blood of my foes. I take a blood bath every day. It is not surprising that I dream of it, as well.~
@1778 = ~'Tis, indeed.~
@1779 = ~*hesitantly* Thou found it exciting?~
@1780 = ~The answers will come in time, <CHARNAME>, if thou chose to keep looking for them.~
@1781 = ~*She nods approvingly.* And neither do I.~
@1782 = ~'Tis one thing to see it in thy dreams, and quite another to wish for it. I have no heart now to ask thee which one thou meant.~
@1783 = ~*Dynaheir's palm is firmly planted on your mouth, but seeing that you are aware, she slowly removes it.* Shh. No need to wake up the sleepers. What didst thou see?~
@1784 = ~Dynaheir... O, Dynaheir. *You shiver.*~
@1785 = ~It is not your business.~
@1786 = ~A childhood memory... I think. With some embellishments.~
@1787 = ~Gorion died because of me, Dynaheir... because of my father, whoever he was; I am sure of it now, and I am more determined than ever to find out the whole of it. We have to go back to Candlekeep with all haste.~
@1788 = ~Dark wings, dark dreams. It seems that I am the son of a crow.~
@1789 = ~
I'm a black-eyed son of a raven, 
or so the dark dreams claim -
but why am I fighting, my lady,
and not circling above the graves?~
@1790 = ~A fountain, a raven and my foster father... *you grin* Sounds like some novel's title, does it not?~
@1791 = ~Do you never sleep? <CHARNAME> sees weird dreams - I think you'd be used to it by now.~
@1792 = ~*She takes you into a timid embrace and waits for you to speak up.*~
@1793 = ~*You never speak, but press your cheek against her shoulder, enjoying the warm comfort of her body.*~
@1794 = ~*You lick your lips.* A childhood memory... I think. With some embellishments.~
@1795 = ~Do let me decide for myself what is my business, and what is not.~
@1796 = ~'Tis thine decision, however, to tell me of thy dream or to keep it secret.~
@1797 = ~Thank you for letting me keep my dreams to myself.~
@1798 = ~
I'm a black-eyed son of a raven, 
or so the dark dreams claim -
but why am I fighting, my lady,
and not circling above the graves?~
@1799 = ~Go on.~
@1800 = ~I dreamt of Candlekeep. I was a slip a lad then, and I did not care for Gorion talking with Ulraunt, the Keeper of Tomes. They argued, and I sat by the fountain, carelessly playing with the water, as children do. Then I saw a reflection of a raven in the water. Ulraunt told my father that we could stay, but that I would be his death. Strangely enough, I was... and I saw him dead. O, and I had the eyes of the raven when I looked into the water of the fountain again. "Like father, like son," my reflection said... and then I woke up. What do you make out of it?~
@1801 = ~Too long to tell right now, but it boils down to the suggestion that Gorion died because of me, Dynaheir... because of my father, whoever he was. I am more determined than ever to find the whole of it. We have to go back to Candlekeep, and soon.~
@1802 = ~That is a wise course.~
@1803 = ~'Tis... inspired, but tells me little of the essence of thy dream, <CHARNAME>.~
@1804 = ~Half-truth is as deceitful as a lie. Tell me the rest, or keep it secret.~
@1805 = ~Too long to tell right now, but it boils down to the suggestion that Gorion died because of me, Dynaheir... because of my father, whoever he was; I am sure of it now, and I am more determined than ever to find out the whole of it. We have to go back to Candlekeep with all haste.~
@1806 = ~I should tell thee in advance that I would never get used to thy dreams. Now tell me the rest, or keep it secret, as thou will.~
@1807 = ~I think 'twas meant to confuse thee and scare thee, but by oversight or by benevolent fate it also gave thee a guidance. An answer to many of thy questions may be hidden in Candlekeep with thy foster father. Perhaps thou could find out more about thy origin from his records and journals, if he kept any.~
@1808 = ~Thou look... determined.~
@1809 = ~Thy face is as hard as if carved of stone. What made it so, hero?~
@1810 = ~Too long the dreams have haunted me and made me doubt. Finally, the dream came untainted and true. In it I saw myself for what *I* am, and for what I must become.~
@1811 = ~It is time for me to fight the murderer of my foster father. It is time for me to kill the closest relation that I have in this world. Sarevok. I must strengthen my heart to do that.~
@1812 = ~*You smile.* Not kissing you for far too long.~
@1813 = ~And that would be?~
@1814 = ~Myself. With righteous will, I have turned the dark forces within to good purpose. I have remade myself in my own image, despite the taint in my blood. I am not like Sarevok.~
@1815 = ~I am the antithesis to Sarevok. I shall destroy him and Bhaal within him.~
@1816 = ~You will see, my witch. You will see.~
@1817 = ~Indeed. My foresight tells me that Sarevok will not die easily. In the distant future, the threads of thy fate will be interwoven with his again.~
@1818 = ~But for now thou hast to fight him. There is no other way.~
@1819 = ~*She kisses you sweetly.*~
@1820 = ~But is that all, hero?~
@1821 = ~Of course not! A hundred more will not be enough!~
@1822 = ~You see much, Dynaheir. I saw a dream that came untainted and true for a wonder. In it I saw myself for what *I* am, and for what I must become.~
@1823 = ~This... bravado worries me. Those art the words that a flatterer would whisper in thine ears. Be wary, <CHARNAME>, for there art many ways one could take and arrive at the Realm of Evil.~
@1824 = ~The promise of glory and self-righteousness is one of the shortest and swiftest.~
@1825 = ~A good intent, for however often Bhaal or the forces of evil should rise, there must be someone to oppose it, if the world is to have any hope.~
@1826 = ~Sarevok, however...~
@1827 = ~*She hesitates.* My foresight tells me that in the distant future the threads of thy fate will be interwoven with his again.~
@1828 = ~But for now thou must fight him. There is no other way.~
@1829 = ~*Dynaheir grows somber.*~
@1830 = ~What is it, Dynaheir?~
@1831 = ~*Ignore Dynaheir's distress.*~
@1832 = ~Are you sulking because we met Tamoko, Dynaheir?~
@1833 = ~I am not Sarevok, Dynaheir. I stay true to the one I love.~
@1834 = ~'Tis nothing. No, I lie. 'Tis the woman we just met, Tamoko. She made me think of how thou art different from thy brother in thy love for thy companions.~
@1835 = ~And for you. I am loyal to you, my friend... my love. And I will always remain loyal - despite anything that fate might throw our way.~
@1836 = ~I beg your pardon, my lady, but my 'brother' belongs on a midden heap for his treacherous mind and vile deeds.~
@1837 = ~You flatter me, lady.~
@1838 = ~Of course. *A tiny grin twists your lips, and you mutter.* Women are so naïve...~
@1839 = ~*Gradually Dynaheir's mood returns to normal, but it seems that a worry crease settled permanently between her brows. You missed your chance to erase it.*~
@1840 = ~Indeed. She made me think of how thou art different from thy brother in thy love for thy companions.~
@1841 = ~I know. Loyalty and duty art qualities that he neither possesses himself, nor strives to cultivate in his followers. He even rejected the woman who sincerely loved him. That is why I believe that thou, not Sarevok, will win in the end.~
@1842 = ~And alongside him the woman who loved him? *She raises her palm to stay your objections.* No, dost not say anything. But delay thy judgment of thy brother, until he himself would call for it. Consider then what Tamoko said. No man who had inspired such love in a woman's heart could be entirely evil or gone beyond recall of honor.~
@1843 = ~Complimenting thy beloved is a wonderful moment of love. A wise woman is never afraid of it.~
@1844 = ~Or am I mistaken? *Dynaheir sighs.* Love hath no use for forethought.~
