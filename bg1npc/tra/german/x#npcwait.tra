@214 = ~Together we shall enforce the laws of nature with the ruthless vigor they deserve.~
@215 = ~Very well, I shall wait here. Mind though that my patience is only as long-lasting as your eagerness to defend the Great Mother.~
@216 = ~Maybe this is for the best. I have no patience for your weaknesses.~
@217 = ~How can you ask me to linger in this unclean place, awaiting your return, when my rage can be spent on bettering the Nature's cause in her bullyragged glades and forests?~
@218 = ~If one day you would once again seek my assistance, look for me in the sacred forest of Cloakwood. Hurry up, though, for very soon the Great Mother might need my strength elsewhere.~
@219 = ~I cannot tolerate the noise and filthy stench of cities. If one day you would once again seek my assistance, look for me in the sacred forest of Cloakwood. Hurry up, though, for very soon the Great Mother might need my strength elsewhere.~

@222 = ~A wise choice. Lead on.~
@223 = ~Agreed. I shall wait.~
@224 = ~Certainly. I am glad to rid myself of such untrustworthy companionship.~
@225 = ~<CHARNAME>, I cannot wait for you here. My life is worth very little, but my vengeance cannot be postponed to appease your fancy. Tazok lives still.~

@229 = ~On second thought, Coran, I want you to stay with the group.~
@230 = ~A wise choice, my friend!~
@231 = ~Sure, I can spend a few minutes dawdling here. Hurry up though, for Lady Luck frowns upon the slothful and the dull.~
@232 = ~You want us to part ways now, just like that? I should have known not to have joined you in the first place.~
@233 = ~Do you take me for a fool, <CHARNAME>? *whistles* I follow your orders, but only when they are sane.~
@234 = ~A friendly lass on my lap and a glass of decent wine in my hand... *laughs* Sounds like the perfect way to spend a stormy afternoon! You've got yourself a deal, <CHARNAME>. I'll wait for you in Nashkel's Belching Dragon.~

@240 = ~Hmm, it seems that all northerners are as mindless as they are impotent. Do as you wish, I will find my own way.~
@241 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. I shall definitely not wait for you here. This place is too dangerous to linger in alone.~
@242 = ~Fine. You can try looking for me in Nashkel's Belching Dragon. Not that I promise to be there, mind you.~
@243 = ~Fine. You can try looking for me in the Elfsong tavern. Not that I promise to be there, mind you.~
@244 = ~I will fight you to mine last breath, Vremoni!~
