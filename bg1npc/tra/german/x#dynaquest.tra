@1    = ~Thy graciousness in rescue is appreciated. Hast thou also rescued mine journal? It was taken away by the gnolls.~
@2    = ~I'm afraid we haven't seen anything like that.~
@3    = ~We will not waste our time searching. The gnolls have probably used it for kindling their fires.~
@4    = ~We will keep our eyes open as we travel. Perhaps someone has already found it.~
@5    = ~Good hunting, friend. I found a peculiar scroll on one of the bodies of some Gnolls who accosted me. It appears to be a page torn from a larger volume, and I do not recognize the language. Maybe it is some kind of cipher? A bad sign that is. Perhaps, the gnolls in the area serve someone more formidable and that is the way they communicate?~
@6    = ~Boo says it looks like Dynaheir's handwriting! My witch will make sense of it in no time!~
@7    = ~Witch? Well, my enthusiastic friend, you are welcome to keep the parchment.~
@8    = ~If you have a learned scholar, perhaps they could take a look at this. It might be important and shed light on some intrigue.~
@9    = ~Dynaheir! Look! We have found writing!~
@10   = ~*squeak*~ [GAM_48]
@11   = ~Minsc, where did'st thou find this parchment, torn from mine journal?~
@12   = ~With this dark looking elf! Boo says he is a great warrior...~
@13   = ~Ah, I see that you are a Hathran scholar. Perhaps you can help me.~
@14   = ~I have the solution to thy puzzle, good elf. This page was torn from mine journal. I was a captive of gnolls for a time, and they have stolen it from me. Hast thou found but one page?~
@15   = ~Just one, m'lady. But the presence of one page is the indication that the whole journal might be nearby or carried off by someone of their number who escaped.~
@16   = ~<CHARNAME>, 'tis quite important to recover the journal.~
@17   = ~We cannot forsake our mission for long to engage in a wild goose chase, Dynaheir. We will only lose time...~
@18   = ~Of course, let us give the thieves a chase!~
@19   = ~And what will I get for doing this?~
@20   = ~I said before, that I have naught to offer in return for mine rescue, save for mine services. However, if thou canst recover mine journal, there art some scrolls magical amongst the pages that I would give thee. Thou canst do with them as thou pleases.~
@21   = ~That sounds like a fair offer. We will do it.~
@22   = ~Dynaheir, I am not interested. It will take too much time, and we are on a tight schedule with our mission.~
@23   = ~We can search the area quickly enough, if we split forces. What say you?~
@24   = ~Maybe you can search for the journal alone?~
@25   = ~Sounds like a good plan! Let's do it!~
@26   = ~I guess I should do it, lest I get fire-balled! Have it your way, Dynaheir. But we will search alone. The matter is small enough. There is no need to involve a Hero of the Realms.~
@27   = ~<CHARNAME>, I will gladly help, as you have helped me earlier. I was going to patrol hereabouts, regardless. We can search the area quickly enough, if we split forces. What say you?~
@28   = ~Nay, the matter is small enough. But thank you for your offer.~
@29   = ~I will gladly help, as you have helped me earlier. I was going to patrol the area, regardless. If I find the journal, I will gladly return it to the rightful owner. I shall meet you here in two days.~
@30   = ~Dynaheir's Journal

Drizzt the Ranger found a page from Dynaheir's journal. He thinks the rest of it could still be in the area on one of the stray gnolls. Dynaheir wants to get it back. Since Drizzt is patrolling the area, he agreed to look for the journal. I wish all my problems could have been solved with such ease. Alas, onward I go... Before I forget! Drizzt will meet me outdoors somewhere around here in two days to report on the progress of the search.~
@31   = ~Well met! Let us convene here after a day of searching.~
@32   = ~Dynaheir's Journal

Drizzt, the Ranger, found a page from Dynaheir's journal. He thinks the rest of it could still be in the area on one of the stray gnolls. Dynaheir wants to get it back. Since Drizzt is patrolling the area, he agreed to join in the search for the journal. Drizzt will meet me here in one day to report on the progress of the search. I am impressed that the notorious Drow is willing to work with us. I may need to search this area after a day has passed to find him again.~
@33   = ~Indeed, I can. If I find the journal, I will gladly return it to the rightful owner. I shall meet you here in one day.~

@36   = ~Dynaheir's Journal

Drizzt, the Ranger, found a page from Dynaheir's journal. He thinks the rest of it could still be in the area on one of the stray gnolls. Dynaheir wants to get it back, so we will search this area.~
@37   = ~Here, boys! We do not fight. We came to warn the witch that the Old One is hunting her. He sent out others - many more than us to find her and bring her back in.~
@38   = ~Stay thy hand, <CHARNAME>. I do not see malice in these creature's eyes.~
@39   = ~Gnolls! Minsc hates gnolls! Right, Boo? They took Dynaheir!~
@40   = ~Stand easy, Minsc. <CHARNAME>, if thou art willing, allow me to trade a few words with the gnolls.~
@41   = ~Listen carefully. You - gnoll. I - <RACE>hero. I will kill you now, gnoll.~
@42   = ~The Old One... Aren't Rashemi male wizards called the Old Ones?~
@43   = ~Very well, Dynaheir. But if they make a single gesture, we will cut them down immediately.~
@44   = ~"Old One"? Who is this "Old One" you are referring to?~
@45   = ~Dynaheir, let me handle this. We must destroy these foul creatures on sight. We can search their bodies for your journal later.~
@46   = ~Indeed, <CHARNAME>, a Rashemi wizard is called Vremyonni - the Old One, but I know not why a countryman of mine would'st orchestrate mine demise. 'Tis either a renegade, or the name is but a coincidence.~
@47   = ~I guess. Well, what does the Old guy want? Does he want to talk to you, or kill you?~
@48   = ~Let us just kill the gnolls and worry of the mighty wizards, Rashemi and otherwise, when we see them.~
@49   = ~Or your Othlor decided that your mingling with Bhaal's Child is a crime.~
@50   = ~No... the Othlors art wise. They would'st not use gnolls to bring me in... or thee. Mayhap the gnoll knoweth what is afoot. Tell me, my good gnoll, who is the Old One and what doth he want?~
@51   = ~The Old One is a sorcerer of great power. He wants the witch. I do not know any more of him.~
@52   = ~The witch's book shows us that the killing is wrong! The Old One is not following The book.~
@53   = ~Curious. Tell me, my good gnoll, how hath it come to pass that thou and thy companions acquired that conviction?~
@54   = ~The Old One ordered to find the witch. Hound said - we sooner find her by scent, and all we had was the witch's book. So Hound ordered me to rip it apart and divide between others... I did. Then me and my pack saw the light. Instead of hunting the witch we came to warn her.~
@55   = ~'Tis as I have suspected. A priest of Mystra blessed my journal, <CHARNAME>, and placed a ward on it that any creature of evil disposition would'st turn around for a time in its nature should'st it try to open it without mine permission. Breaking the journal must have made the enchantment more potent as the foursome was affected, and it still did not wear off.~
@56   = ~Uhm... well, thank you, Gnoll, I suppose. Do you happen to know where we can find Dynaheir's journal? Does the Old One have it?~
@57   = ~So, are we getting Dynaheir's journa- er... witch's book back? She needs it, you know.~
@58   = ~Hand over Dynaheir's book, or we will take it from you.~
@59   = ~The witch's book shows us that the killing is wrong!~
@60   = ~Uhm... well, thank you, gnoll, I suppose. Do you happen to know where we can find Dynaheir's journal? Does the Old One have it?~
@61   = ~Well, Dynaheir, it is your call. How should we deal with this?~
@62   = ~The Old One? 'Tis strange, <CHARNAME>. A male wizard in Rashemen is called Vremyonni - the Old One ...~
@63   = ~Mayhap they seek to question me, or thee... but no.~
@64   = ~It would not be the first time I have witnessed people turn against me.~
@65   = ~You do not believe these foul creatures mean you harm?~
@66   = ~Perhaps you are right. But I do not trust a gnoll, even ones pretending to come in peace.~
@67   = ~We keep the book - when we find it. Others have it. It showed us the light - maybe it shows the light to others? Or protects us against the Old One?~
@68   = ~No it won't. It's not some holy text, just some notes. Give it back to Dynaheir, creature!~
@69   = ~If you have faith in it, the book will help you. Go in peace.~
@70   = ~Right. Got it. Well, good gnoll, keep the journal if you find it and be a good boy. Ta-ta!~
@71   = ~Good luck, gnoll - I wish you well, but we seek the book for Dynaheir. Leave this area now. Do not stray, for we will be watching you carefully...~
@72   = ~I sense that you have done many villainous deeds - murder and worse - in the past, creature. But all I see now are good hearts. I will not execute you to correct the past wrongs, but will order you to live and to make amends for all the ills you have caused. Stray off this course - and my blade will find you. Go now, convert such foul creatures as you may and stop wrongdoing that you see. So I, <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, charge thee.~
@73   = ~Whatever your story, I just do not like your muzzled face, gnoll. I am going to kill you all!~
@74   = ~If you want to kill us, we will defend ourselves. We will not raise our weapons otherwise.~
@75   = ~I thank thee for the warning, good gnoll. Go in peace.~
@76   = ~Hold on for a second with the hugging and tears of gratitude, Dynaheir. You are going to let these creatures walk away, when they enslaved you, and were going to eat you?~
@77   = ~I cannot help but doubt that the ward is permanent. I better kill the gnolls off... to be on the safe side.~
@78   = ~Verily. To do otherwise would be wrong.~
@79   = ~We do not have the book. We search for it.~
@80   = ~And we shall search as well. If thy journey dost meet again with ours, we shall discuss this further. Until then, go in peace.~
@81   = ~Very well. Go in peace.~
@82   = ~I smell the witch! The Old One will be pleased. Kill them!~
@83   = ~Tis my journal! Thank thee, <CHARNAME> I had a scroll carefully hidden amongst the pages - 'tis thine.~
@84   = ~<CHARNAME>, I trust that you understand that I cannot let a journal by a Rashemi witch slip past me. The well-being of Thay may depend on whether I am given a chance to inspect it. Give it to me, simian, and you shall be rewarded.~
@85   = ~Edwin, I cannot betray Dynaheir's trust! Besides, she already has the journal.~
@86   = ~You will have to kill her to get to the journal, Thayvian. On your own.~
@87   = ~I'll ask her to lend you her journal in the interests of establishing truce between Rashemen and Thay.~
@88   = ~Now, now, Edwin. I am sure it's all personal stuff. Do you really want to hear of Dynaheir's first love or some such women adore writing down in every detail?~
@89   = ~Stop sulking, my precious. Trust me, there is nothing to impede Thay's glory in those notes. Love life, recipe of Vassan cloudberry six-layered cake most like...~
@90   = ~Short of doing it yourself, you will never get rid of the witch. I seem to always fall upon people who are either brain dead or born without brains.~
@91   = ~And why should I do *your* job? Trust imbeciles to kill a witch...~
@92   = ~It sounds so lawful-stupid, that it can actually work. (Of course the witch would think that I will not crack the code.) Go ahead, ask her.~
@93   = ~Dynaheir, Edwin here expressed a concern that the information in your diary might be of a dangerous nature. He requests your permission-~
@94   = ~Dynaheir, surrender your journal to Edwin!~
@95   = ~Erm... Dynaheir... oh, nevermind.~
@96   = ~Do you seriously think that even such a primitive person as Dynaheir would throw a tantrum about her pink pages?~
@97   = ~*hisses* Permission! I asked for no-~
@98   = ~Thou art plotting again, Edwin? *Sighs* As thou command, <CHARNAME>. See if thou indeed art sufficiently intelligent to read the code. I expect the return of mine journal tomorrow, <CHARNAME>.~
@99   = ~I would not. And I recommend thee to speak to me with more deference.~
@100  = ~What? You ate your tongue, or just forgot what words are for?~
@101  = ~Edwin, thou art at thy plotting again?~
@102  = ~I, Edwin Odesseiron, command you to surrender me this journal, witch!~
@103  = ~I will do no such thing, Edwin.~
@104  = ~I am most concerned, <CHARNAME>. The Thayvian does seem to make much demand on thy goodwill... and mine.~
@105  = ~Let me tear him limb from limb, and Boo will feast on his eyeballs!~
@106  = ~Silence! You are here only because I wish it. (Where did I put that wand... perhaps if I back away slowly...)~
@107  = ~That is enough from both of you. We have more pressing problems right now.~
@108  = ~Edwin, silence. You can watch Dynaheir, but not fight with her.~
@109  = ~Dynaheir, silence. You can watch Edwin, but not fight with him.~
@110  = ~I have had enough of this fighting. Perhaps all of you should leave. I will think about this, and talk to you privately if I need you to leave the group.~
@111  = ~I am glad to see you again, my friend. I have recovered your companion's journal.~
@112  = ~A vicious group of gnolls had it. I do not know if it makes more sense to you than to me, but they were claiming fealty to someone they called 'The Old One'.~
@113  = ~Here is the journal.~
@114  = ~I am most grateful to thee, Drizzt Do'Urden. Allow me to offer thee this scroll as a token of mine gratitude.~
@115  = ~I was glad to assist. Fare thee well!~
@116  = ~<CHARNAME>, can I have a word in private with you?~
@117  = ~I am talking to Drizzt Do'Urden, Edwin! Drizzt Do'Urden! Not you.~
@118  = ~I'll be right back, Drizzt. *after moving aside with Edwin* What is it, Edwin?~
@119  = ~Edwin, I have no secrets from my companions. Say what you have to say in front of the others or shut up.~
@120  = ~Drizzt Do'Urden can talk? (Likely, he has found a potion of genius. That is the only way I see him becoming capable of putting words into coherent sentences. AND without Cattie-Brie's help. Remarkable.). Well, go talk to Drizzt then.~
@121  = ~Thy day hath expired, Red Wizard. I would have my journal back.~
@122  = ~Here it is, witch. I... I have inspected it. (I would be damned if I let the witch know that I could not read it. It's gibberish anyway.)~
@123  = ~*loudly* I have noticed that mine journal hath left my backpack. I would want to announce that I have renewed the ward on it.~
@124  = ~Ye wizard be better payin' me mine due afore ye read the bloody-~
@125  = ~*Giggles* I would not wanna to name names, but y'all know that it was Edwin... If I were a Red Wizard I wouldn't peek into it!~
@126  = ~A woman with such a foresight will never find herself a lover...~
@127  = ~Daaarling, why waste your time on preserving some dull notebook? How about an enchantment to keep skin moist and silky-smooth?~
@128  = ~Well, I think it's not morally right to take away the years' work of a scholar. But... er... sometimes things that are immoral are a fun challenge.~
@129  = ~Here it is, witch. I... I have inspected it as my duty to Thay dictated. (I would be damned if I let the witch know that I could not read it. It's gibberish anyway.)~
@130  = ~Greetings, <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep. I am Winski Perorate of Rashemen. A Wychlaran that travels with you is under investigation. The Othlors ordered me to bring Dynaheir back to Rashemen.~
@131  = ~I will see first the Othlors' letter, ordering me to obey thine command. Otherwise, a Hathran is free to do as she pleases, and I wish to stay with <CHARNAME>.~
@132  = ~Do not defy me, Wychlaran, or I will take you by force.~
@133  = ~If that is what thou wish... to send me away... I will obey.~
@134  = ~Minsc and Boo will not let their witch to be spirited away again!~
@135  = ~Then you shall come along, beserker.~
@136  = ~Just to be sure that you do not follow, enjoy these creatures, my little playthings. AWAY!~
@137  = ~Dost not threaten me, wizard. No good will come out of it.~
@138  = ~Oh, no... Not another fight! Go with him, Dynaheir, I have no desire whatsoever to meddle in Rashemi affairs.~
@139  = ~*You step between Dynaheir and Winski grimly, yet resolutely, weapon in hand.* Are you trying to steal from *me*? What gall! Well, go ahead, pal. Skewering wizards is fun in my book.~
@140  = ~*You step between Dynaheir and Winski with an easy grin on your face, weapon in hand.* Now, that's a song in the making. One more step her way, and I shall fight you to the death to save my lady love from your clutches.~
@141  = ~*You step between Dynaheir and Winski squarely, drawing your weapon menacingly.* The lady said she stays with me. So step back or I will introduce you to my blade. Trust me, not many survive the experience.~
@142  = ~*You step between Dynaheir and Winski squarely, trying to act as courteously as anger bubbling within you would allow.* My lady Dynaheir's request for an appropriate order is a just one, sir. Until such time as you can produce it, lady Dynaheir is under my protection and will not be whisked away against her will. I will defend her with my life if need be. ~
@143  = ~*You step between Dynaheir and Winski looking at the man darkly from under the hood of your cloak* Listen, friend... no paper - no lady. You try anything and I will fight you.~
@144  = ~*You step between Dynaheir and Winski resolutely, opening yourself to your deity to lend more power to your words. Indeed, your voice turns out worldly and impressive when you begin to speak.* By the divine grace that I am given, I swear to defend Dynaheir, should you try to force her to go with you.~
@145  = ~*You step between Dynaheir and Winski and begin to speak softly yet firmly.* I answer not to an Othlor, but to Silvanus and the Great Mother and I do not care what scroll you have or have not about you. If lady Dynaheir does not agree to be taken away, I will ensure that she won't be.~
@146  = ~*You step between Dynaheir and Winski, quick as a cat and just as ready to pounce at the wizard. Yet your voice is calm and collected.* Your failure to produce appropriate documentation coupled with an immediate threat, moves me to conclude that you are false. Lying is a dishonorable thing, stranger. I hope you fight nobly, for I am prepared to fight you, should you dive to the very bottom of dishonor and try to kidnap Dynaheir.~
@147  = ~*You step between Dynaheir and Winski, probing the Weave. The magical energy starts shaping about you.* I answer but to my conscience and my heart, Vremyonni. And they both tell me to defend Dynaheir with every spell I've got and my life if need be.~
@148  = ~*You step between Dynaheir and Winski, probing the Weave. The magical energy floods you, warm and powerful. It speeds up the flow of blood in your veins and burns your throat.* They say you are a sorcerer, Vremyonni; let us see whose blood runs thicker with magic. I will not surrender Dynaheir against her wish!~
@149  = ~Finally, there is someone who would take the witch off my hands!~
@150  = ~Finally, there is someone who would take the witch off my hands! Any chance that you'd grab her retarded bodyguard with the hamster in the bargain?~
@151  = ~Thousand gold - and she is yours!~
@152  = ~I can find another wizard, but I will never find another Dynaheir. She stays.~
@153  = ~Give me a solemn vow that Dynaheir would be returned to me unharmed -~
@154  = ~Vows can be broken, <CHARNAME>. The man hadth had gnolls to capture me, and only happstance made it possible for me to avoid torture and dishonor.~
@155  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, you are too significant for the gods' struggle to die... I have witnessed you eluding death again and again, and I do not see it as a simple coincidence. I will not risk the divine favor by slaying you... by mischance. But I need the woman.~
@156  = ~*Snaps his fingers*~
@157  = ~Here, creatures, get the dark woman for your master. Kill everyone but her and the boy.~
@158  = ~Here is your money.~
@159  = ~Are you in love, fool? With the witch? Then gods love fools, indeed.~
@160  = ~On the graves of my ancestors I swear to return Wychlaran Dynaheir to you unharmed. Gnolls did not touch her on my orders.~
@161  = ~I would not entrust my companion to a man who conspired with gnolls! Dynaheir is right - your word is nothing! You want her - you will have to cut through me! ~
@162  = ~Did you just call her Wychlaran again? 'Tis not how one who respects the witches of Rashemen calls them! You'd have said Hathran if you were a true Rashemi Vremyonni! You are an imposter and I will not surrender Dynaheir to you!~
@163  = ~I am unsure whether to be relieved for thine success in driving away the wizard, <CHARNAME>, or worried.~
@164  = ~Fear not, Dynaheir! Minsc and Boo will not let their witch be spirited away!~
@165  = ~We have little to worry from so weak a spellmumbler. (I curse this day, and these fools. The witch is not dead, and an unknown faction competes with Thayvian plans.)~
@166  = ~Don't worry, <CHARNAME>, we took him this time. Y'all know we can take him again!~
@167  = ~It would be wise to watch for this Winski Perorate.~
@168  = ~I do not believe that thy path is safe from this countryman of mine. We ha'st best continue with care.~
@169  = ~So, you have come for me, witch. *His bitter laugh becomes a wheezing cough.*~
@170  = ~I do not know thee, wizard. I came from Rashemen to find Bhaalspawn Sarevok of whom I heard in Sembia... And of late my labor has become helping <CHARNAME> to stop Sarevok Anchev's war. Thou hast never been my task, whoever thou art.~
@171  = ~Do not lie! *clutches his chest* The Othlors... the Hathrans... they were looking for me ever since I... fled Rashemen. They sent you to kill me so I would not reveal their puny secrets. They did not think much of me to send one puny Wychlaran...~
@172  = ~I repeat again that 'tis not my task. Thou art an exile then, one of the Vremyonni who chose to leave, but bear the responsibility of the craft?~
@173  = ~I have not heard of anyone do that in the past eighty years. ~
@174  = ~It had been more... than that for me. I hate your kind, and I hate Rashemen! What cruelty is it... to force a man into the Arcane craft by the sole virtue of him possessing a talent? How fair is it that he has to become a landless exile if he... does not want the duty? You were not after me... makes little difference I suppose.~
@175  = ~Rashemen may have driven me into the shadows, but I have had my revenge. I was Sarevok's mentor, and tutored him in the blackest of rituals. If he were to succeed there is no doubt I would be among the dead, but my name would live on in his wake.~
@176  = ~There are things beyond death if you die in the right fashion, and how could there not be a place in history for the architect that shaped the actions of the ascending Lord of Murder? You would not understand; you were born to affect the Realms. The rest of us must carve our own place by whatever means necessary.~
@177  = ~Let the Three judge thee for whatever harm thou hast done Rashemen... Or Othlors. Help me in mine task, and thou might yet gain their forgiveness. Tell me of Sarevok, thy master, and we will heal thee.~
@178  = ~You would heal me so I can be taken to Rashemen and tried as a Bhaalist? No...~
@179  = ~You cannot heal me... even if I agreed to that... travesty of justice you'd offer me. I extended my life magically, using Vremyonni's magic... the healing cannot bring the borrowed years back... I am dying, witch. With you for a mourner.~
@180  = ~Dost not thou want to die in peace? To help the goodness thou hast denied for many a year as a Bhaalist?~
@181  = ~Bhaal has abandoned me as did the Three. Nobody loves traitors. Neither would you, witch, and your comrades. I do want to die in peace... In peace, witch, not spitting out all I know of my master to his foes. I can still send you all to your graves... ~
@182  = ~I call on your blood contract, nabassu, tanar'ri. By your true name, get rid of them, "Aravaata"!~
@183  = ~Ah, the call of foolish flesh... And looking very frail, even by the puny standards of mortality! Ha, stupidity such as this could amaze even I.~
@184  = ~Ki... *Winski feebly grabs his throat and convulses*~
@185  = ~To dare call on the mighty Aravaata while on the brink of death... Truly, 'tis a waste of my talents extinguishing such a flimsy candle.~
@186  = ~Yet of course, the sheer indignity of this summoning demands nothing less. I will deal with these other wandering slabs of meat, but your soul will be my personal trophy, weakling!~
@187  = ~I do not pity the vremon his fate. I hope that... perhaps one of thee can send a message to Rashemen about his demise?~
@188  = ~We shall tell all of Rashemen together!~
@189  = ~*glances your direction quickly* We shall tell Rashemen together if we can, but death stalks this land.~
@190  = ~You are wise to send a message now, forstalling its loss in our inevitable demise.~
@191  = ~Ye silly fool, Winski's dead and gone. Ye be better payin' attention t' Sarevok, not dust!~
@192  = ~Never fear, but there is much more life to live. We can all visit Rashemen after this business is over.~
@193  = ~Daaarling, why waste your time with silly thoughts of death? Winski is gone, we are here, and my hair is not even in disarray.~
@194  = ~Dynaheir, your cause is my cause. By Helm, I will swear to deliver it.~
@195  = ~Yes, yes, of course we will... deliver your message. (Fools... my work here is nearly done, and I will soon leave these morons behind.)~
@196  = ~We have friends to send the message through, but you worry needlessly.~
@197  = ~Y-y-yes, my d-dear lady, worry not. We can send a message quickly.~
@198  = ~Ooohh, we just won! Death may be stalking us, but we have won every contest so far. Let's go finish this!~
@199  = ~Aye, now, we can handle this. Travelin' together seems t' agree wi' us~
@200  = ~<CHARNAME> an' I, we'll take ya there, an' deliver the message personal!~
@201  = ~Death may stalk this land, but now we stalk Death.~
@202  = ~*quietly* I thank thee all. If thy wills demand, then I shall say no more of death. Thy promise of aid should I fall is enough, if needs demand.~
@203  = ~Boo says, enough talk! Onwards! We have Evil to butt-kick!~
@204  = ~The gods may be contesting, but our faith will bring Sarevok down, Dynaheir.~
@205  = ~Nothing will stand before our weapons and survive, Dynaheir.~
@206  = ~With both of us spellweaving, Sarevok will fall as did Winski.~
@207  = ~We will dance our way to Rashemen together, Dynaheir. Let's just finish this quest together!~
@208  = ~We will make our way to Rashemen together, Dynaheir. Let's just slip in quietly, get this done, and be on our way.~
@209  = ~Dynaheir, do not worry. Death has no hold on us.~
@210  = ~Dynaheir, we will send a message when we can. We need to get to Sarevok quickly.~
@211  = ~We won. Stop being defeatist. Let's go give Sarevok a quick introduction to the Grim Reaper.~
@212  = ~We have but to continue forward into the Undercity to find our fates. Perhaps these items from the fallen vremon can serve us with more success.~
@213  = ~In pursuit of Sarevok

I found Winski Perorate near the entrance to the Undercity. Apparently he was Sarevok's mentor, but he was cast aside as a traitor for daring to rescue Sarevok instead of killing the Grand Dukes as he was supposed to. Dynaheir may not have been tracking this Vremyonni, but he had had a guiding hand in both our quests. War, slaughter, and wholesale death to become a god. I must stop this before Sarevok flees to try his scheme anew.~
@214  = ~Enough bickering. I can use both your talents. Leave your private battles for another time.~
@215  = ~If he wishes to travel with you, perhaps I should travel with you as well.~
@216  = ~Idiot! You do not know what you are asking! (There are too many of these monkeys to attack now. Prudence.)~
@217  = ~I will accompany you, <CHARNAME>. I would not trust your life to a Red Wizard without allies.~
@218  = ~If you will not kill the witch immediately, then so be it. I shall remain with you, to stop her evil lies from poisoning you. (There will be opportunities for her disposal. The fool will be easily manipulated.)~
@219  = ~We should be moving along now. I think you both need to rest and recover your spells as soon as possible.~
@220  = ~Rescue Dynaheir from the gnoll stronghold.

I have rescued a mage by the name of Dynaheir, over the objections of Edwin. They will both be valuable assets to my group, I am sure. Or they will rip us apart by fighting eachother. I am not sure which one is more powerful, but we shall just have to see.~
@221  = ~And just to be clear, I am leading this party. Your differences will remain secondary to our goals.~
@222  = ~Good. That is settled.~
@223  = ~Dynaheir's Missing Journal

Dynaheir has asked after a missing personal item. If we find it, she would appreciate our help returning it to her.~
@224  = ~Dynaheir's Missing Journal

We have retrieved Dynaheir's missing journal. She has decided to keep close watch on it in the future.~
@225  = ~Meeting Drizzt

Drizzt is a wandering sort. He mentioned that we might see him later somewhere along the Sword Coast. Perhaps we will meet again.~
@226  = ~Farewell.~
@999  = ~Dynaheir's Missing Journal~
