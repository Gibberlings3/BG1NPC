//@0    = ~Ya been smarter as a stone!~
//@1    = ~Stop yapping, dog. I have come to punish you for your treachery, for your sniveling ways! Tempus is with me!~
//@2    = ~I hoped you'd smarten up some, big wench, before botherin' me again. But I see that ya didn't. Ya think I'd be afraid of you and these boors that freed ya from my spell?~
//@3    = ~Stupid cow. If ya'll ain't outta my face in the next five seconds, I'll blast ya to kingdom come!~
//@4    = ~No! <CHARNAME> gave you <PRO_HISHER> leave, but you don't have mine! Raise your weapons!~
//@5    = ~You are disgusting, wretch... Kill him, <CHARNAME>. One who begs for his life has no honor. He will betray you to Tazok if you let him go.~
//@6    = ~No, I won't, I won't... *under his breath* Harpy!~
@7    = ~Seawolf venerates Umberlee, <CHARNAME>. She rules the waves and sea winds from her flooded layer of the Abyss. She is worshipped out of fear, not adoration. Mariners throw gold and gems into the ocean when caught by the storms in hopes to appease the Bitch Queen. Her followers are as violent as their patron. It will be a good battle, <CHARNAME>, but if you ever plan to sail the seas... I know that you can fight men, but could you fight the tall waves?~
@8    = ~Hahaha! Again, again! *claps*~
@9    = ~Our prim and proper <CHARNAME> on a bearskin rug. A thought I will not forget anytime soon.~
@10   = ~Ah, <PRO_HESHE> is still a cutie!~
@11   = ~It's good to see SOMEONE is making a profit off of my misfortune. I suppose.~
@12   = ~Er... Gotta go!~
@13   = ~If only that one were gifted to wield a blade half as well as he wields his tongue, he'd be truly a wondrous creature.~
@14   = ~Aye, I wish that too sometimes. Then I could be an adventurer.~
@15   = ~Filthy, vermin-ridden pig spawn! Tempus knows your treachery and will grant me the strength to strike you down!~
@16   = ~Kill them, but leave the big wench to me!~
@17   = ~Honestly, cannot you people take care of yourselves? Has the brat not been taught to hold a sword, at least? This display of abject cowardice against mere worgs is pathetic.~
@18   = ~'Tis a valiant deed these two have attempted, though all for naught 'less we grant them aid. I respect their forthrightness; let us lend them our strength.~
@19   = ~Please. What say you, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@20   = ~This one has confidence in his bearing, but his hands do not bear the calluses of a skilled swordsman, and his eyes are dim and lazy. Let us show him what a true warrior is like in battle.~
@21   = ~Ah, my pretty, I'd rather you show me what you like between the sheets, but if you doubt my skill...~
@22   = ~I like not the looks of this, <CHARNAME>. This one has a furtive manner, and I trust not the suspicious set of his face. He would not be so cautious 'less he had something to hide from Tempus' sight.~
@23   = ~Don't ya be standin' there all day! Come on!~
@24   = ~A basilisk! Stonegazers, slayers with sight... I have known what it is like to be stone, and greatly desire to take vengeance for the memory out of the hide of this creature!~
@25   = ~Bored, foolish and have a score t' settle. You qualify. Now, get in there and kill the critter already!~
@26   = ~A miserable, undignified little errand, but so long as it grants us the chance to battle once more...~
@27   = ~Listen ta tha lady.~
@28   = ~This priest is out of his mind. Perhaps a hearty stroke with a hammer will put him back in it again.~
@29   = ~You are mad yourself, sister, but you will be cured shortly...~
@30   = ~Give up all our iron?! I would sooner give up my maidenhead first!~
@31   = ~Your iron and your life!~
@32   = ~I fail to see the need for such an act. Can we not simply slay all who dwell here and oppose us, and leave the place a tomb? Pah, we should bring ruin to our enemies with the fair and forthright might of our sword arms! Not by trickery and sabotage. *spits*~
@33   = ~Rill! Please go talk to Rill!~
@34   = ~Infant wyverns? Pathetic. I'd rather find an enemy more worthy of gutting, but as Tempus wills it.~
@35   = ~*laughs unkindly* Nobody laughs at my students!~
@36   = ~A man so cursed with madness as to be berserk? I almost envy him his clarity of vision.~
@37   = ~You envy a man who has slain everyone he loved?~
@38   = ~In truth, that mageling is too rude for my liking. I'm tempted to teach him how to be more mannerly and hospitable. But Tempus forgive me, what is the point in challenging someone so obviously weak?~
@39   = ~FINALLY, a warrior with real potential! Though he COULD use a good dose of enthusiasm.~
@40   = ~Are we to be hired by this foul-smelling, weaselly little man to attempt petty theft?! Come now, this is beneath all of us!~
@41   = ~Excuse me, miss, but I have bathed only yestereve, and I am quite confident that you did not.~
@42   = ~Are we to be hired by this foul-smelling, weaselly little man to attempt petty theft?! Come now, this is beneath all of us! Even Xan.~
@43   = ~Are we to be hired by this foul-smelling, weaselly little man to attempt petty theft?! Come now, this is beneath all of us! Even Montaron.~
@44   = ~Are we to be hired by this foul-smelling, weaselly little man to attempt petty theft?! Come now, this is beneath all of us! Even Viconia.~
@45   = ~<CHARNAME> here acts like a proper bandit. I suppose I should be grateful that <PRO_HESHE> accepted my services as a payment for un-petrification.~
@46   = ~Have basilisks sneaked up on you also?~
@47   = ~No, it was a dishonorable dog, a mage who traitorously turned me into cold stone.~
@48   = ~That is horrible!~
@49   = ~It's a thing of the past. The foul enchantment is dispelled, thanks to <CHARNAME>. Fare thee well, Tamah, and go with Tempus' blessings. It's as much as I can do for you.~
@50   = ~Thank you.~
@51   = ~<CHARNAME> has made it <PRO_HISHER> habit to turn stone to flesh, my good woman. For I was rescued by <PRO_HIMHER> from the same unnatural state.~
@52   = ~It's a thing of the past. The foul enchantment is dispelled, thanks to <CHARNAME>. Fare thee well, Tamah, and go with Tempus' blessings.~
@53   = ~Don't blame <CHARNAME> - <PRO_HESHE> must be acting out of habit: for I was rescued by him from the same unnatural state and I offered my services as a way to repay for <PRO_HISHER> kindness.~
@54   = ~It's a thing of the past. The foul enchantment is dispelled, thanks to <CHARNAME>. Fare thee well, Tamah, and go with Tempus' blessings.~
//@55   = ~The dishonorable dog is dead! Tempus, your will is done! Come, let's drink to Tempus and to victory, <CHARNAME>!~
@56   = ~*shivers* There is a foul smell about this place... something cold and rank, and somehow... it seems familiar. Tempus, give us the fortitude to find the source.~
@57   = ~Ah, there's nothing like the smell of fresh blood to bring a tingle to the nose and a smile to the face. Scalps make good trophies. Ugh, this one could have stood to have washed his hair once a tenday.~
@58   = ~At last, a battle worthy of my mettle! COME TO THY DOOM, FIEND! TEMPUS WILL SEE THY BLOOD BOIL!~
@59   = ~Arise, sluggard! If I must slink so low as to be a mere robber, I will not deprive my victims of a chance to retain their wealth fairly! DEFEND THYSELF!~
@60   = ~Well, 'tis about TIME. This is more like it!~
@61   = ~Riddles. I HATE riddles. Can't we just slay them all instead?~
@62   = ~Zzzzz... wha... wait a minute. I don't own a cat. Who's there?~
@63   = ~Your death, if you don't keep still and quiet! I'll take my fill, and you will live another day!~
@64   = ~The jig's up! Out, we must get out!~
@65   = ~I'm a stray, go back to sleep. Shhhhhhhhhh...~
@66   = ~*shakes his head at Branwen* But you have not come here to talk about Brage at length. Do you have need of supplies that the Temple of Helm can procure?~
@67   = ~Here we go!~
@1001 = ~You're too late. She is stone no longer.~
@1002 = ~The statue has come to life?! Gotta go!~
