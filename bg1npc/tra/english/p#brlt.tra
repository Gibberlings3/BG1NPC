@0    = ~Your skills are well honed, <CHARNAME>, and your technique is impressive. That could have only been accomplished through years and years of constant study, no less. Who trained you, and where?~
@1    = ~I do not want to talk about it. The memories, the wounds... they are too fresh, yet.~
@2    = ~I was tutored in fighting arts by the soldiers of Candlekeep.~
@3    = ~My foster father, Gorion, arranged my training in the secluded fortress, not far from here. I may show the place to you, if you wish.~
@4    = ~Branwen, I am your leader, not a boy in need of praise or scorn! Leave me be with your questioning!~
@5    = ~That reminds me, Branwen: you are a warrior priestess of Tempus. Can you give me a few lessons?~
@6    = ~'Twas not my intent to re-open your festering wounds, <CHARNAME>. The deed is done, but as a healer, I know of a remedy: to treat the like with the like. A careless phrase caused you pain and aggravation, but mayhap a soothing balm of comrades' banter would whisk away your hurts and worries? Tell me, what happened to you?~
@7    = ~Nothing that would interest you.~
@8    = ~My foster father was brutally murdered, Branwen. It is not something I can speak of lightly.~
@9    = ~I miss Candlekeep. I miss its stables, its library halls, its armory - and I cannot go back.~
@10   = ~Candlekeep? Where is that?~
@11   = ~It is a library fortress west of Beregost.~
@12   = ~Branwen, have you ever seen anything besides your Northern isles?~
@13   = ~Never mind. It is time to march on.~
@14   = ~I come from Norheim isles, <CHARNAME>, and yes, I deem myself as having seen and done much. You, on the other hand, are not being wise by offending those who spill their lifeblood by your side.~
@15   = ~I am ready, <CHARNAME>. Let us bring Tempus' wrath upon our foes!~
@16   = ~Tempus willing, we might see it together some day. I must confess that I am somewhat envious of you, <CHARNAME>. My own home is much farther than a day's march away, and memories of it grow paler and dimmer with every fortnight. But what of your training?~
@17   = ~It was good while it lasted. I learned much, but I lost much, as well, when my studies were rudely interrupted by my foster father's violent death.~
@18   = ~I did well, but I think that I will accomplish more on my own.~
@19   = ~My training? Why, a man in spiky armor gave me a nice lesson some time ago. His technique was perfect, too. Just one minor detail, though: he killed my foster father, and I was forced to tread the roads, unsheltered and alone.~
@20   = ~You are akin to the sleeping volcano: one moment 'tis smoldering quietly, the next moment it explodes with fire, ashes and molten lava. Answer me or not, as you will. But you are mistaken: I do not think of you as a boy, yet.~
@21   = ~Yet?~
@22   = ~I thought otherwise.~
@23   = ~Yes, Branwen, I am a warrior, and a skilled one. Young I may be, but I am no longer a boy.~
@24   = ~<CHARNAME>, you are a warrior of your word, and I am proud to fight by your side. But no man stands a chance in battle on his own, and no wise leader shirks a hand of friendship. You would do well to remember that.~
@25   = ~'Tis better to perish from the hand of the worthy foe than to shrivel and wither in your own bed. Tempus does not have any respect for the latter.~
@26   = ~Do you wish to tell me how he died? Was it in an honorable battle, or was it a coward's death?~
@27   = ~Aye, a battle it was. We were attacked by a group of five, not far from my former home. A woman nailed me with a fire spell, and two ogres leaped at Gorion. He saw clearly that we had no chance, and ordered me to run. I obeyed.~
@28   = ~I defended him to the last, Branwen! I killed two ogres and a woman, and a fearsome warrior ran away from me as he saw their corpses! But I could not save my foster father.~
@29   = ~I do not wish to discuss it further, Branwen. It is time to march on.~
@30   = ~Hold your tongue, priestess! Gorion was no coward; he fell, defending me. It was... it was I who fled the battlefield.~
@31   = ~I am glad that you are determined to become a proper warrior, and I look forward to see your future glory. The path of arms is the brightest of all!~
@32   = ~You ran? You turned tail and ran? How could you! How could you forsake your elder in the hour of need?~
@33   = ~Branwen, I had no choice! You said that I fought well, but it was not enough to defeat those brigands!~
@34   = ~I always obeyed Gorion's command, and so I did on that day.~
@35   = ~I do not know. Perhaps, it was a spell of some kind, and not my will alone.~
@36   = ~Does it matter? I am alive, and he is dead! That's all that needs to be said.~
@37   = ~After Tranzig's wicked magics, I have started to doubt my own battle prowess, <CHARNAME>, so I cannot help you in this matter. But what of your own training?~
@38   = ~You... you lie, <CHARNAME>! Are you a foolish boy or a drunkard, to indulge in storytelling that easily? No matter, it seems that I cannot trust you with my thoughts.~
@39   = ~Perhaps. You have displayed your valor in battle, and I have no reason to doubt your strength and courage. Still, it leaves me uneasy.~
@40   = ~<CHARNAME>, I am sorry that I yelled at you so. If your father fought gloriously, then he is content in whatever afterlife awaits him. And I... am content with your explanation.~
@41   = ~You are hardly better than Tranzig.~
@42   = ~I must admit, I feel more at ease with you, now that I sated my curiosity about your younger years. But I think 'tis most unfair if I do not tell you of mine.~
@43   = ~Please, continue, Branwen.~
@44   = ~Yes, I would like to learn more of you.~
@45   = ~Another time, perhaps.~
@46   = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@47   = ~You are not interested? It is a pity. I have truly started to see a leader and a comrade in you.~
@48   = ~And so have I, but there is no time for idle talk right now.~
@49   = ~I did not mean it this way, Branwen. If you want, tell me of your own training.~
@50   = ~I am sorry, but I have not.~
@51   = ~As I said, it is a pity. Mayhap next time your mood will be less somber and sour.~
@52   = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>, I shall.~
@53   = ~As I said, it is a pity.~
@54   = ~Every youngling in our village learned to wield a club or a dagger early enough. The pirates of the Nelanther were not to be trifled with; they exhausted the land by their plunders more than once in my memory. I got my first lessons on the art of warfare and mastered my first mace before I even started to mature.~
@55   = ~...~
@56   = ~Branwen? Is anything wrong?~
@57   = ~Continue, Branwen. I am listening.~
@58   = ~Is that it? Thank you for the story, then.~
@59   = ~Yes, it is best that I stop here. Lead us, <CHARNAME>, lead us to victory.~
@60   = ~'Tis not fitting for a warrior to become limp and overwhelmed with memories. But if you truly wish it, I will continue.~
@61   = ~For as long as I remembered myself, I worshipped the Lord of Battles. The Norheim Isles harbored a temple of Tempus, but only men were allowed into the priesthood. A mistake, it was: oft good young men come to the temple with the most devout faith, but an immature character. Still, I bear them no grudge.~
@62   = ~The rumors of my desire to become a priestess had soon reached the Battleguard, and I was driven out from the village, much as a stray scavenger: with but a frail stick in my hands. I made a voyage to the mainland and offered my services to local militia. Tempus' grace lingered on me, until I lost his favor by joining a band of brigands and pillagers. But 'tis over now.~
@63   = ~By Auril's knickers, you've listened to the end of my tale! An ale's on me, friend. 'Twould be a shame if I tired you out.~
@64   = ~Yes, well, I didn't have any choice, did I? The only way to shut you up was by caving your head with a hammer!~
@65   = ~You didn't tire me at all. It was an interesting story, Branwen.~
@66   = ~Deal. But it better be a good brew.~
@67   = ~Woman, you have a long tongue! Say, did you consider becoming a bard?~
@68   = ~You should have told me that before. Do not squirm, I will not trouble you with my 'tales' from now on.~
@69   = ~Well good! I'll tell you of my faith next time. Mayhap I'll open your soul to Tempus yet.~
@70   = ~'Twill be, if you choose a good inn. The mark of a decent tavern is its liquor, and, by Tempus, I'll not settle for a poor one!~
@71   = ~I would gladly have become a skald of virtue, to sing ballads and inspire heroes, but 'tis unfitting to hail two deities at once.~
@72   = ~You pursue your enemies with ardor, but I wish that the zeal you display in battle was matched by equal daring of your soul and spirit. Without faith, you are but a husk of a man.~
@73   = ~You are mistaken, Branwen. I have faith.~
@74   = ~True. Tell me of your god, then, so I might understand.~
@75   = ~I am uncomfortable talking of such. My sword speaks for me well enough.~
@76   = ~To tell you the truth, Branwen, I do not need faith. Yes, I know that gods exist, but it's not enough reason for me to venerate them.~
@77   = ~Branwen, you shouldn't trouble your pretty self overmuch. A faith is a faith, but I heed other things in my life: weapons, women, wine...~
@78   = ~I put my faith in Tempus, much as you do.~
@79   = ~Truly? My apologies if I have offended you. 'Twas an error to take you for an unbeliever. I'll tell you of my own faith, and mayhap you will understand what caused my desire to share my beliefs with you.~
@80   = ~You are a warrior worthy of Tempus' grace, but you travel a hideous path. Although you are adept and capable, your assaults must be tempered with restraint and discipline that only faith can give, or your fate will be no better than Shar-Teel's.~
@81   = ~You are a warrior worthy of Tempus' grace, but you travel a hideous path. Although you are adept and capable, your assaults must be tempered with restraint and discipline that only faith can give.~
@82   = ~That comes dangerously close to the worst sort of heresy, <CHARNAME>. Weigh and ponder your words carefully, for no deity tolerates such cool disdain and ignorance, and Tempus above all.~
@83   = ~'Tis flattering that you indulge my vanity, <CHARNAME>, but I will not allow you to lead me astray with your jesting. Women and wine soften your body outside the battle, while faith strengthens it.~
@84   = ~Allow me to tell you of Tempus, and then you will see whether your heart listens to what your head does not.~
@85   = ~I will not bother you with long and tedious recitals. Tempus sees true devotion, and does not favor smooth-tongued tricksters.~
@86   = ~War is a force of change, <CHARNAME>, fair and pure, and it should not be feared. Courage, decisiveness and skill is required of a warrior on the battlefield - Tempus does not require that you engage in a hopeless battle, but that if you do, you halt it quickly and resolutely, never underestimating your foe. The goal and challenge of every battle is personal betterment, and thus honorable demeanor is as important to the warrior as mother's milk is to the newborn babe.~
@87   = ~Thank you, Branwen.~
@88   = ~That is the way I live and fight, Tempus or not.~
@89   = ~You are beautiful when you recite Tempus' tenets, Branwen. Could I ask you to do it again? I am anxious for a... private performance.~
@90   = ~What utter rubbish! Do you believe in all that?~
@91   = ~Bah! I am wasting my time with the likes of you.~
@92   = ~Hmm... mayhap we can arrange it sometime. But humor me, first.~
@93   = ~Do you strive to harness the tides of battle, <CHARNAME>? Or do you seek and take the coward's way out?~
@94   = ~I find no fault in my actions. I'm not the type to submit into a berserker rage, after all.~
@95   = ~I do not cower, Branwen. My path is clear, and it is the path of righteousness.~
@96   = ~Kill 'em all, and kill 'em quick, I say.~
@97   = ~Do not dare to judge me, woman. You will regret it.~
@98   = ~A killing arm is but a beast's claw without pride and honor to guide it. Look to faith, <CHARNAME>, before vileness consumes you.~
@99   = ~I am most happy to hear that from your lips, friend. Let us plunge into the next fray, then, and teach the lesson to the faithless and dishonorable!~
@100  = ~I have little liking for cowards, <CHARNAME>, yet I see that you are not one.~
@101  = ~But still, you would do well to ponder my words: it will not hurt you to be more forthright in battle from now on.~
@102  = ~I confess, I almost feel at home in your war party. 'Tis a good thing that we move and grow from battle to battle. In Seawolf, the life was sickeningly still and morbid, much like a dying man's hovel.~
@103  = ~Tell me more of your life on the isles, Branwen. What was it like?~
@104  = ~Seawolf? How did it get its name?~
@105  = ~I would still prefer that 'morbid' life to being hunted and homeless.~
@106  = ~Branwen, we shouldn't dawdle here.~
@107  = ~I mostly remember the sea and marine affairs, rather than tarnished rocks and deepsie moors, <CHARNAME>. My people, Rauthymar, or Northlanders as outsiders call us, came to the isles over four centuries ago. Yet, our lands are mostly wild and untamed, for 'tis not fitting for men of battle to become peasants, even in the times of peace - and these were scarce. We are more seamen than farmlings, and would much rather explore the waves than till the fields. Thus, over the years the ship became as important to the warrior as his weapons, and my people even have a saying: 'the ship is the sword that cuts the waves'. ~
@108  = ~How poetic. Your people are more expressive than I gave them credit for.~
@109  = ~Please, go on.~
@110  = ~Thank you, Branwen, that was enough.~
@111  = ~'Tis an old legend, <CHARNAME>. Some say a great battle and bold unravelled on that shore, and a pack of greater seawolves devoured a tribe of sahuagin, fish creatures. The werewolves succeeded in driving off the interlopers, but, in their own turn, were hunted and killed by my people. Others insist that a great warrior of some renown challenged the beasts' leader to a fight, and killed him in a fair battle, making the remaining wolves scatter.~
@112  = ~Would you care to hear more of my home?~
@113  = ~Yes, please, Branwen.~
@114  = ~No, Branwen. My own home occupies my thoughts entirely.~
@115  = ~'Tis hard for you to be on the run, I know. But surely, you will not choose a mere farmer's life, when a truer path and a worthier destiny lies before you?~
@116  = ~I would, if I had a chance.~
@117  = ~No, I will not. Speaking of a worthier destiny, we should really get a move on.~
@118  = ~We shall see. For now, tell me more of your own home.~
@119  = ~Be it as you wish.~
@120  = ~My thoughts of you were of the able bodied warrior, not of the spineless cattle. 'Tis painful for me to be mistaken so.~
@121  = ~We take the craft of storytelling very seriously, <CHARNAME>. Our minstrels are recognized masters of the art, and we treat them with a healthy level of praise and respect, but just about everyone is called upon to tell a tale now and then. Were I myself a scald, I would deliver a song or recite a poem, but as we say, Kazgaroth stepped on my ear when I was a babe.~
@122  = ~What else should I tell you of?~
@123  = ~Tell me more of your people.~
@124  = ~Tell me of the monsters and beasts that inhabit your land.~
@125  = ~Tell me more of the sea.~
@126  = ~I think that I've heard enough, Branwen. Thank you.~
@127  = ~My people are tall and muscular, fair-skinned and fair-haired. 'Tis hard to become a Northlander's enemy, if you're not a wicked deceiver or a criminal on the run. If you behave properly, speak plainly, and offer a gift of thanks for proffered hospitality, then you will earn my kin's trust and respect. But 'tis unfitting for me to focus on them too much, as 'tis akin to speaking of myself.~
@128  = ~True, the Norheim isles are not without monstrous threats. Trolls are common on all the islands, and while Tunnel Trolls, Kraghanargh, are just a hindrance, for Sea Trolls I harbor a special loathing, as they are fond of sinking boats. One of these boats bore my grandfather...~
@129  = ~Gnolls are making a comeback along the western coast, and Kobolds' kin, Draka, ambush travellers in the moors. Sahuagin attack coastal villages from time to time, and there is many a tale of the Restless Dead as well, but the settlements themselves are well protected. In other words, if you want trouble on the isles, you'll have to go looking for it.~
@130  = ~Sea to us is a friend and a nurturing mother, yet a harsh and exacting mistress, and many boats have drowned at the swish of her fickle and unpredictable hand. She rules all, the climate, even: 'tis rarely possible to go to bed at night with any sort of certainty of what the weather will be like in the morning.~
@131  = ~My ancestors were no simple fishermen, <CHARNAME>. They followed the way of the sea in many a way, raiding as well as trading, and sometimes, I admit, becoming akin to the pirates of Nelanther. But make no mistake: the pirates are much more brutal and merciless in the way they go about their business. When my people raided, if you behaved bravely and with honor, you could be certain your family would be safe and left with enough stores to survive. The Nelanther dogs, on the other hand, demonstrated no such graciousness, and for that, we attack the pirates on sight, and offer no quarter to them.~
@132  = ~Thank you, my friend and steady listener. 'Twas a rare pleasure.~
@133  = ~I was in the wrong when I recounted to you tales and yarns of Norheim with the flair of a cat in heat, or a love-struck youngling. It has obviously revived painful memories within yourself. Your face grows darker by the moment; are you thinking of Candlekeep?~
@134  = ~I am. I am trying to put it behind me, but it is hard, Branwen. So hard...~
@135  = ~Branwen, I am fine. It must have been a trick of light.~
@136  = ~'A cat in heat'? Branwen, are you in love with me?~
@137  = ~Yes, my fair maiden! I shed my tears by pints, and I sigh by night and by day. Only you can relieve me of this unspeakable torment!~
@138  = ~Every warrior has their moments of weakness and doubt, lest they crumble and fall, much as the unyielding rock gives place to the fresh and willowy sapling... Come to me, <CHARNAME>, and let me hold you for a moment.~
@139  = ~Truly? <CHARNAME>, I oft see this expression. 'Tis akin to the one on the faces of seamen, when their wives are hungry, and the waves are high. They know that they're going off to die, but they set sail and row hard, because they must. They never return.~
@140  = ~Branwen, dear, I am fine. Well. Good. What part of this don't you understand?~
@141  = ~I... I feel the same, I guess. I don't know for how long I shall be able to go on.~
@142  = ~You persist in using strange allusions, Branwen. Wives, love-struck younglings - what do you imply?~
@143  = ~Um, <CHARNAME>, I was jesting. I've no doubt that you will make an excellent romp between the sheets, but 'tis not the proper time.~
@144  = ~*snort* Oh, never mind. 'Tis good to see you're well, however.~
@145  = ~I mourn for your loss. Thankfully, all members of my own family are alive and well. Norheim is a mysterious land, <CHARNAME>, mysterious and full of eldritch wonder. My kin are known for putting their trust in various beliefs and myths that are so widespread among us. One of these says that a mother feels whether her born children are alive. I believe that when I parted with my family, my lord Tempus graced me with the gift to feel my parents, brothers and sisters, while their souls still linger in this world.~
@146  = ~Do you have a big family, then?~
@147  = ~Brothers? Sisters? What of your husband and children?~
@148  = ~It is rather nice.~
@149  = ~If only I was able to feel that death threatened Gorion! I would have warned him.~
@150  = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, a big and merry family, and while I was not the eldest of the lot, I oft acted in my mother's stead. 'Tis hard for a Northlander woman to keep both her home clean and her children well-fed and in check. That said, my father was strong and fortunate, and many a beast was slain by his hand. Our stores were full, and we never froze in bitter winters.~
@151  = ~<CHARNAME>, I left my people to serve Tempus. 'Tis unlikely that any of the young men in my village will ever look at me favorably again.~
@152  = ~'Tis better than nothing, in any case.~
@153  = ~'Tis different, <CHARNAME>. No mortal man or woman is capable of seeing their future clearly, and even the prophets' visions are vague. We must make our fates with what we have, and what we are given.~
@154  = ~Now I have gone soft and girlish. Lead me to battle, <CHARNAME>, before I flop on the ground and whine piteously that I want to go home.~
@155  = ~I must admit, <CHARNAME>, I have come to like you, as a companion. You fight hard and well, you are easy to be with, and you have rescued me from a terrible fate. Yet I frown when I think that you may be looking upon me and seeing a damsel in distress.~
@156  = ~I've never thought of you thus. I appreciate your strength and courage, Branwen.~
@157  = ~You are a valiant companion. Don't let these foolish thoughts deceive you.~
@158  = ~Being a damsel in distress is not that bad, Branwen. Any of us could wind up trapped in that stone.~
@159  = ~They say that the woman's strength is in her weakness. It never hurts to seem weak from time to time.~
@160  = ~Why would such a thought come into your head?~
@161  = ~In truth, you could not. Tempus gave me power to fight and heal, but though sometimes I read freely in the hearts of men, I am not one for subtleties. Tranzig's slithering tongue put my doubts to rest easily, as I know he could not have done with you.~
@162  = ~It did, because every song and ballad of my childhood delivered a tale of a fabulous rescue and a magnificent victory. These tales reflected upon a helpless, fragile maiden who is naught but a nuisance and a hindrance to the warrior, but who is saved, loved and treasured for the rest of her life. I did not think her undeserving, but, I confess, for me such a role would turn into the worst imprisonment and shame.~
@163  = ~Wise words, <CHARNAME>, but twisted. You seem to want... to want to see another woman in my stead, because I could never stoop to such unworthy tricks. I shall say no more.~
@164  = ~Mayhap you think I am one of these doppelganger monsters who are said to have invaded Durlag's Tower in the west? I cannot shift my demeanor at will, <CHARNAME>, and won't.~
@165  = ~You're right... <CHARNAME>, you're right. Give me a moment to collect myself, and I'll join you in whatever fray you pick, and steer myself clear of these foolish doubts.~
@166  = ~I thank you for your encouragement, but these cursed itches and irritations of doubt will not leave me alone.~
@167  = ~As we travel, I find my condition harshly and horribly reminding me of some weakling princess, born in an ivory tower: you have saved me, befriended me, and now my mind softens and oft wanders to the thoughts of hearth and family instead of my hammer and helmet. 'Tis disconcerting.~
@168  = ~Yeah, this is bad. I'd like you to pay attention to my own hammer more often, if you get my drift.~
@169  = ~Branwen, you do not have to be strong all the time.~
@170  = ~Thinking of hearth and family is not a sign of weakness, Branwen. The most fearless of soldiers are those who fight for their hearth, and home, and the loved ones.~
@171  = ~You are not losing strength, when you think of family and hearth, you are gaining it. 'Tis a different sort of strength, the woman's one. Do not short-change it.~
@172  = ~But I'd like you to become just such a helpless maiden! In fact, it would be a welcome change.~
@173  = ~You are a warrior, not a whimpering child! Sober yourself, Branwen, and stop this foolishness!~
@174  = ~<CHARNAME>, 'tis not an ordinary doubt. My future course and fortune depend on whether I am resolved to be stalwart or resigned to become soft. Will I recover my former self again, or will I fade and mellow, like a mountain does when it diminishes to a hill?~
@175  = ~*sigh* Um, nevermind.~
@176  = ~Branwen, wait! I know that it must be hard, but I want to help!~
@177  = ~Branwen, are you a priestess of Tempus, or a neophyte of Ilmater? Pull yourself together, and let's go!~
@178  = ~Woe is me, for my lady Branwen is becoming a vapid, delicate ghost of a maiden! When should I expect you to swoon and faint, madam?~
@179  = ~*remain silent*~
@180  = ~Ha, well said! My fine humor wasn't lost on you!~
@181  = ~Let us go, then, friend. You've relieved my heart of its deadly weight yet again, and I am most grateful. *winks* Methinks the hour of inspecting your hammer is not far away.~
@182  = ~Thank you, but I now desire to turn to Tempus for guidance. If I may have a moment undisturbed, I would like to pray.~
@183  = ~<CHARNAME>! Nothing so dishonorable... um, but were you actually expecting me to swoon? In any case, I was not intending to faint on purpose... Ah, to Hades with you! You were speaking in jest!~
@184  = ~My heart beats easier now, but do not speak of such to me again. 'Swoon and faint', by Tempus...~
@185  = ~*snicker*~
@186  = ~I heard you moaning in your sleep another night. It might be that I am intruding, <CHARNAME>, but do you have nightmares?~
@187  = ~You are impossible, Branwen. What I dream of should not concern you.~
@188  = ~Yes, ever since Gorion died, and I was forced to fight for my dear life. I am used to nightmares, Branwen, do not worry.~
@189  = ~I do not have any bloody nightmares, and I was not moaning. It must have been the wind, or a lovesick cat that you have heard.~
@190  = ~If you do not mind, I would rather not discuss it further, Branwen. I took you along to fight my battles, and I am not interested in discussing my private life with you.~
@191  = ~I am a healer, <CHARNAME>, I might be able to help you. You look troubled; you have ill dreams. Even now I see pain in your eyes!~
@192  = ~'Tis awful. I see how these deaths twine into your dreams and wear you down.~
@193  = ~*smile* Of course. A lovesick cat it was. Should you meet that poor animal, do let me know. I might have a potion or two to help the unfortunate beast to sleep better.~
@194  = ~And that is precisely what I am doing: fighting your battles. Fear cuts deeper than swords, they say. I am a healer, and a good healer mends souls as often as mending bodies.~
@195  = ~Mayhap a sleeping draught...~
@196  = ~No, Branwen, no sleeping draught will help. These are visions, not dreams.~
@197  = ~Thank you for the thought, but no, I do not need a potion. I will manage.~
@198  = ~I know you mean well, but I do not require any help. The nightmares leave me bare and bleeding, but they bring me power once in a while.~
@199  = ~Sleeping draught? How about the taste of a sweet maiden's lips, instead?~
@200  = ~No draughts, no potions, and no discussions of my private life. Not with you, anyway.~
@201  = ~Here, take this. Sleep well, <CHARNAME>.~
@202  = ~You sound so sure, <CHARNAME>. So be it. But you need only to ask for my help, should you change your mind.~
@203  = ~Oh, you are one of those who would go through the worst torture to gain even the smallest grain of knowledge or power? Suit yourself, then. But you need only to ask for my help, should you change your mind.~
@204  = ~My kisses are known to wake men up, not to put them to sleep.~
@205  = ~Have it your own way then, you stubborn lout. You will not hear another word from me save a battle cry.~
@206  = ~Ah! You got wounded again in the last battle! <CHARNAME>, be more careful! Scars grace a warrior, but you may well lose an eye or an ear!~
@207  = ~Why, Branwen, do you care about my appearance?~
@208  = ~You are right. I'll watch myself better next time.~
@209  = ~It does not matter. As you said, scars grace a warrior.~
@210  = ~Branwen, stop your cooing! I do not enjoy being mothered.~
@211  = ~Yes, I do, and it puzzles me that you do not. Not in a feminine way, surely, but I would prefer that you resembled a spring ready to uncoil at your foes, rather than a stringy plant kept in a dark and damp cellar. Without proper caution, many a trained man ended up as the latter.~
@212  = ~An able and forthright man does well on the battlefield, scars or not, 'tis true. But a gash on the cheek is one thing, and a grave injury is another. No man can fight properly with stumps for limbs and crutches for swords.~
@213  = ~'Twas not mothering, <CHARNAME>. As a man grown, you do not need a woman to watch your every step, let alone a bitching, nagging harpy to reprove and belittle your moves. But I will step back if you wish it.~
@214  = ~For all your skill and aptitude, sometimes I see a rash, wild, and reckless youth in you.~
@215  = ~I left Candlekeep bare weeks ago. I am just such a reckless youth, Branwen.~
@216  = ~Oh? What about that kobold you've chased all the way to the river shore, singing battle hymns?~
@217  = ~I am a warrior, and I shall crush my enemies as and when I please.~
@218  = ~But whatever happens, you will heal me, won't you?~
@219  = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. But injuries differ by nature. If a vampire gets hold of you, or a bunch of wyverns tears you in two, my skills will be vain and useless.~
@220  = ~*chuckle* That's what my father would inevitably say to my mother, when she became too persistent in her worry over his safety. 'Twill be as you say, <CHARNAME>.~
@221  = ~*blushes* The bugger tried to steal my lucky pebble I've brought from Norheim, a memento of home! 'Twould have been a stain to my honor if I had let him escape!~
@222  = ~Well, I am oft negligent and careless, too, when the tide of battle sweeps me away, I admit. We make a matching pair, <CHARNAME>, hmm?~
@223  = ~<CHARNAME>, sit with me for a moment.~
@224  = ~Certainly, Branwen. What is it?~
@225  = ~Do you feel lonely?~
@226  = ~No, I am too tired.~
@227  = ~'Tis an illness that comes and goes as an uninvited guest. Loneliness, <CHARNAME>, and sadness.~
@228  = ~I'm afraid I do, <CHARNAME>.~
@229  = ~*sigh* I can't blame you for that. May Tempus bless you with healthful and sound sleep tonight, then.~
@230  = ~Our band is a jolly bunch, if a touch strange. Our mission is righteous and just, and I'll be the first to crush down a moaning weakling who dares to disparage our efforts. Yet at times I miss my kin, my comrades in arms, and the plain joy of true companionship.~
@231  = ~Do you mean to say that you don't like it in my group?~
@232  = ~I hoped to have earned your friendship by now.~
@233  = ~You have my support, my trust and my loyalty. Or do you want more than this?~
@234  = ~Can't your musings wait until tomorrow? I am exhausted, Branwen, and wish only to sleep.~
@235  = ~I value your company, <CHARNAME>. Tempus forgive me, if I say that 'tis almost as important to me as my faith and my honor. We have fought, sweated and bled side by side.~
@236  = ~Do continue.~
@237  = ~Here go "Ruminations of Branwen the Wordy, Tome 1". Wake me up when you're finished.~
@238  = ~*yawn* Branwen, you're tiring yourself out, and me, as well. Go to sleep.~
@239  = ~Your jibes went too far. Find yourself another target.~
@240  = ~Yet I find the true closeness lacking. 'Tis good to know that a trusted comrade stands by me as I plunge into battle, but, I confess, with my friends and kin there was no peril so great that it would frighten us, none at all.~
@241  = ~This is akin to what I feel, when I look into your eyes.~
@242  = ~Give it some time, Branwen. We haven't spilled enough blood together, yet.~
@243  = ~Whoever you choose as your ally is irrelevant. The battle itself is more important.~
@244  = ~You should leave us, then. There is no hope for you here.~
@245  = ~You were all too ready to listen; what came over you?~
@246  = ~'Twill be a pleasure to leave your sullen moods for tonight, in any case. Hmph!~
@247  = ~Do... do you? Did you speak in jest, or did you mean it?~
@248  = ~I did. I meant it, I mean.~
@249  = ~I don't know. But we might grow close... in time.~
@250  = ~Branwen, you've read too many romance novels. Go to sleep.~
@251  = ~True enough. I will hold your words close to my heart, <CHARNAME>. Now go to sleep, before you collapse in my lap.~
@252  = ~A butcher could say such, but not a warrior and a hero. I fear that I've judged you wrongly.~
@253  = ~Should I go and seek Tranzig's former cronies? Or wander the Sword Coast aimlessly? No, <CHARNAME>, Tempus' hand brought me here, and unless you commit a dishonorable deed or cast me out, my sword arm and battle chant are yours.~
@254  = ~I had not expected such of you, but, I confess, it warms and gladdens my heart.~
@255  = ~Sleep now, <CHARNAME>. I need to ponder your words, and send a prayer to Tempus for receiving them.~
@256  = ~'Twas Tempus' hand that brought us together.~
@257  = ~You think so?~
@258  = ~Indeed. I am grateful to the Lord of Battles for this... unexpected gift.~
@259  = ~No, Branwen. It was your own hand, and mine.~
@260  = ~Maybe. Let us continue on, shall we?~
@261  = ~Now that you say it, I've noticed that you are oft silent and reclusive. What troubles you?~
@262  = ~Nothing, Branwen. I simply like walking in silence.~
@263  = ~Gorion's death, numerous bounty hunters, my mysterious enemy... Shall I continue?~
@264  = ~Oh, just leave me alone! I am tired of you!~
@265  = ~I'm sorry to trespass upon your thoughts with my flimsy musings, <CHARNAME>. Mayhap tomorrow be a better day.~
@266  = ~Have it your way, then.~
@267  = ~Gods do not rule our lives in every detail, 'tis true. But they have the power to change one's life from within, if one opens up to them. I dedicated myself to Tempus, and thus my soul sparks with his divine grace and greatness. ~
@268  = ~I believe that it was Tempus who made me see you... as more than a friend.~
@269  = ~You have no more doubts, then? I thought you missed your kin too much to pay attention to me.~
@270  = ~'Tis great news, my lady Branwen. Shall we celebrate this happy occasion?~
@271  = ~At last! Now, when do we make the next step?~
@272  = ~Branwen, I am sorry, but I cannot say the same.~
@273  = ~Um... er... Well, I...~
@274  = ~Your stance and courage appeals to me, and so does your... <CHARNAME>? Why do you mumble and stutter?~
@275  = ~Oh, it's nothing. I was overwhelmed by good news, Branwen.~
@276  = ~Branwen, I am sorry. I do not love you.~
@277  = ~I... I, um, don't know...~
@278  = ~I see. I had not expected it of you... but I cannot begrudge your heart its choice.~
@279  = ~Oh, for Tempus' sake! Obviously, you are not able to handle me and my desires. Better that it ends now, then.~
@280  = ~It is rare for me to admit my wrongs, but I do, now. 'Twas bad and harmful of me to dwell on the past, and I was unjust when I compared you to my kin.~
@281  = ~*laughs* As soon as you cease to regard it as just a 'step'.~
@282  = ~I am not proclaiming my everlasting love for you, <CHARNAME>. I said this only because I believed you to be distraught after the other night when I picked at you, and likely challenged our friendship. 'Twas noble of you to handle my words in a kind and mature fashion, and I wish to repay you with words gentle and true. I feel affection for you, <CHARNAME>, and attraction.~
@283  = ~I am honored, Branwen.~
@284  = ~Why, thank you. If only your hammer was as eloquent as your speech, all my foes would have long been dead.~
@285  = ~Now, what was the name of the romance novel I've read it in?~
@286  = ~*Branwen smiles and kisses you on the cheek.*~
@287  = ~*blushes fiercely* <CHARNAME>, thank you... though your compliment seems somewhat strange. But never mind.~
@288  = ~*Branwen stands still for a moment, facing the wind, her blonde locks flying wild around her face. Then she smiles and turns to you.*~
@289  = ~Do you like my new hairdo? I have the best hairdresser in the world.~
@290  = ~Branwen, all I see is you facing gusts of wind. Not that you do not look pretty with your hair flying, but what sort of hairdo is that?~
@291  = ~Wind will be your hairdresser, then?~
@292  = ~Ah? What?~
@293  = ~Why do I get a disturbing feeling that the next thing you will ask me will be whether you look fat in your armor?~
@294  = ~Northern wind hairdo - the style I prefer to any else.~
@295  = ~I like your style, Branwen. I always wanted to meet a woman who looked lovely without making an effort.~
@296  = ~Now, if you only cut your hair, make some of those little curls, whatever they call them, and put some make up on, then I'll say you've improved your appearance. Letting the wind make a mess of your hair will not do anything for your looks.~
@297  = ~*laughs* I noticed that you were watching me, and I was fishing for a compliment from you.~
@298  = ~Oh, a compliment? The lady's desire will be granted, then. I like your style, Branwen. I always wanted to meet a woman who looks lovely without an effort.~
@299  = ~Now, if you only cut your hair, make some of those little curls, whatever they call them, and put some make up on, then I'll say you've improved your appearance. Letting the wind make a mess of your hair will not do anything for your looks.~
@300  = ~Sorry, Branwen. The rough lips of this warrior are unaccustomed to saying gallant nonsense.~
@301  = ~I will not, do not worry. Never again.~
@302  = ~I am afraid we have different ideas on beauty. 'Tis a crucial difference.~
@303  = ~I think you have just presented me with a challenge. I should take some time and help you to brush up your skills in gallant talk.~
@304  = ~You have my permission to tutor me in gallant matters, madam.~
@305  = ~Branwen, I am eloquent enough with ladies who are of interest to me. You are not one of them.~
@306  = ~That will not be needed, Branwen. I prefer to admire you with my eyes.~
@307  = ~I see it as a challenge. I am going to prove to you that I have fine knowledge of the science of tender passion, and of its linguistic applications.~
@308  = ~I will take this task very close to my heart, <CHARNAME>.~
@309  = ~Honesty is one of your finest qualities, <CHARNAME>. Worry not, I shall leave you alone.~
@310  = ~You are more proficient in the ways of love than I have thought.~
@311  = ~I shall be waiting for a demonstration... impatiently.~
@312  = ~<CHARNAME>, stop eating me with your eyes! Come and kiss me, if you so desire!~
@313  = ~Me... to kiss you? Just now? Just like that?~
@314  = ~*grin* Yes! My maiden has made me the happiest <PRO_RACE> in the Sword coast! Nay, in the whole world!~
@315  = ~I shall do so with pleasure, my lady Branwen.~
@316  = ~Branwen, anybody may see us here. Would you mind saving it for later?~
@317  = ~*smirk* This eve, <CHARNAME>. And no excuses.~
@318  = ~<CHARNAME>, you're hopeless! Yes, just like that.~
@319  = ~Alright...~
@320  = ~Branwen, I'd rather not. Anybody might see us here.~
@321  = ~I... I expected to find my zest matched. But you have surpassed all my hopes and anticipations... <CHARNAME>, humor me again.~
@322  = ~It will be a pleasure.~
@323  = ~Of course...~
@324  = ~We could continue it later, if you do not mind.~
@325  = ~Ugh, no. I prefer women with at least the basic notion of personal hygiene.~
@326  = ~If not for my still lasting gratitude, I would have challenged you to a fight, I swear. A slug is less repulsive than you.~
@327  = ~Shall... shall we... again?~
@328  = ~*nod*~
@329  = ~Yes!~
@330  = ~No, Branwen, enough is enough.~
@331  = ~Is your stamina so lacking? Oh, I did not mean to offend, <CHARNAME>. The last battle was bloody indeed, and our current journey is dark and exhausting. But I hope that this eve you will allow me to color your uglier memories of this day with happier recallings.~
@332  = ~*grin* Now I have to ask for your permission to continue.~
@333  = ~That was... quite a kiss. Can I hope for more?~
@334  = ~Woman, you have drained me through and through!~
@335  = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. How could I refuse?~
@336  = ~'Tis shameful, <CHARNAME>. I gave you my word to try and teach you some sweet talk, but your... closeness... is so... distracting... Rest assured, you will receive your first lesson this eve.~
@337  = ~'Tis a pleasing thing to get some rest after glorious battles in Tempus' name. We have done well, the fire is warm, and no danger is near. Come, sit by me, and I shall soothe your hurts and heal your wounds.~
@338  = ~I feel quite well, Branwen. The day's work is done, but did we not decide to exercise in courtly speech? Shall I start my lesson now?~
@339  = ~My wounds are all healed, Branwen. Do you know what I appreciate about a fire the most? It is the way it softens features and makes our hearts gentler. About our lesson in gallant talk, my lady - is there a better time for it?~
@340  = ~It sounds more than promising, Branwen. Will you stay with me this night?~
@341  = ~Branwen, all I need is a good night's sleep. Just leave me where I am.~
@342  = ~Bah! I shall do so gladly!~
@343  = ~There will never be a better time. So lead the way, <CHARNAME>.~
@344  = ~Should I start complimenting you, then?~
@345  = ~I am few of words, Branwen, but I will try. Mmm...~
@346  = ~Of course! Now, where was my "Manual of Indecent Compliments?"~
@347  = ~On second thought, it is too taxing. Can I just kiss your hand and buy you a dozen of crimson rhodelias, instead? My mind is set on... other things.~
@348  = ~*smirk* I would very much like to look at this tome. But I am sorry for interrupting you, <CHARNAME>~
@349  = ~Please do.~
@350  = ~Your eyes show clearly you were born of the sea, but while the sea is cloaked in mists and mysteries, they unravel warmth and love...~
@351  = ~My lady's hair is a magnet for the wary and unwary alike...~
@352  = ~Your lips are as red as the sun in her bed, and just as hot...~
@353  = ~Your hands are a paragon of amazing strength and dexterity...~
@354  = ~Your armpits are as pungent as fresh onions, tart and sharp...~
@355  = ~I cannot think of proper words.~
@356  = ~I think there has been enough talk for tonight. My mind is set on... other things.~
@357  = ~Let me help you, then.~
@358  = ~Your eyes are ever serious and deep, but the sparkle of mirth they hold within warms me more than would the blazing fires in the eyes of another.~
@359  = ~You are an able and determined warrior, and your body bears the honor marks of every confrontation from which you emerged alive and victorious. These signs appeal to me, and do not belittle neither your appearance nor your ability.~
@360  = ~Your wit is a delight to share, but a curse to bear.~
@361  = ~Your hands are a part of you that whispers of ferocious yet gentle storms, and of burning ice...~
@362  = ~Are you ready to continue?~
@363  = ~Yes.~
@364  = ~Could you give me another example?~
@365  = ~True indeed. You may well discover more of this later tonight, <CHARNAME>.~
@366  = ~*chuckle* I wonder, then, how would you describe yourself? Unwary you seem...~
@367  = ~*As Branwen opens her lips to your kiss, her eyes shine.*~
@368  = ~Not only that, <CHARNAME>. They comfort your pains, and still your sad and angry memories. For tonight, I am not only a healer, but a woman.~
@369  = ~*Branwen turns purple and stalks to her bedroll without another word. The angry glance she casts at your direction speaks for itself.*~
@370  = ~Yes... I confess, I wish to be with you, as well. Come to me, <CHARNAME>. Let us partake of each other in full.~
@371  = ~The elflings are known to say "By the sea and stars!" The dwarfs usually grumble in their own language, the orcs grunt, and the halflings prepare a feast. My own people have no words for this occasion at all.~
@372  = ~Good. I don't think we need any.~
@373  = ~And what will my Branwen say?~
@374  = ~Are we talking about the same occasion? The one that took place last night?~
@375  = ~What are you talking about?~
@376  = ~Onward, then. To another battle, another victory... and another night.~
@377  = ~Nevermind. The air is crisp and clear, you look well rested... shall we go?~
@378  = ~Well rested? I hardly slept at all! No, Branwen, I am staying right here.~
@379  = ~Of course.~
@380  = ~But what about last night? Do you feel that you have chosen well?~
@381  = ~Have you suddenly grown lax and unmanful? But I must admit, some true rest is not uncalled-for.~
@382  = ~Last night... 'twas a pleasure, to say the least. You possess what it takes to venture into lands of passion and heat, and I do not find your desire lacking.~
@383  = ~It was a pleasure to me, as well.~
@384  = ~You flatter me, my lady. Shall we go?~
@385  = ~It is not only desire. I love you, Branwen.~
@386  = ~I...~
@387  = ~'Tis unflattering and unwelcome news to you, I know. But I cannot speak to you of love, yet - and I am not sure I will. Give me some time for my thoughts to clear.~
@388  = ~Do you see this weapon, <CHARNAME>? 'Twould take a long time to trace its origin and tell its tale. The dark ore was melted into large furnaces, and was thrown into ice cold water, and was finally shaped into the blade which is strong and noble. And so was I. My flesh lived, and suffered, and turned to stone under blows of life. Yet you have found a way to revive it.~
@389  = ~Are you speaking about your body or your soul?~
@390  = ~What was it like being a statue, Branwen?~
@391  = ~I am happy to see you alive and whole.~
@392  = ~Your heart is not made of stone, my Branwen. Never think otherwise.~
@393  = ~Both suffered equally, <CHARNAME>. The body is but a temple that houses my soul, true, yet 'twas the worst punishment and torture to be rendered helpless and unable to move, yet conscious and capable of thought.~
@394  = ~My faith and your friendship kept me whole, <CHARNAME>. Yet remembrance of horrors past stays, and ripens, and grows bitter. 'Twas a gruesome and appalling fate that lay in store for me, being helpless yet able to think, denied even the shameful bliss of oblivion.~
@395  = ~This I know, <CHARNAME>. But Tranzig did not. He said: "A woman with a stone heart... shall all be stone..." And thus I became the statue you found at the Carnival in Nashkel.~
@396  = ~I will recount the memories of the days I've spent in my sorcerous imprisonment, if you wish, but will you want to listen?~
@397  = ~Yes, Branwen. I am ready.~
@398  = ~No... I am scared of what I may hear.~
@399  = ~Better not risk it, Branwen. Let us go.~
@400  = ~Very well. Walk with me for a while, then. In silence, if you must.~
@401  = ~*Branwen takes a slow, shuddering breath and starts to recite, her eyes darkening by the moment.*~
@402  = ~Sky, forest, tents. People are going about their business as usual. This day is one of many, and it is still mine to watch. I watch mesmerized. Stone eyes cannot cry, why can they see?~
@403  = ~They cannot. You dreamt it, Branwen.~
@404  = ~Why, indeed?~
@405  = ~Were you able to see from within your prison of stone? That's monstrous!~
@406  = ~Sometimes, when a soul dies, the rain cries and mixes the cold sky with cold dirt and blackened embers that are left after the trees are gone. But it happens also that when a soul dies, sun shines on the red, purple and golden leaves, and the universe is at peace with itself. Some weep when her soul dies, some laugh. I can only be silent. What day will it be when my soul ceases to exist? We have had good weather lately, so most probably it will be warm when I shall hear the last faint beat of my heart. My lips are sealed, my lips are white, so I will neither laugh, nor cry. My heart ever so slowly, ever so painfully turns to stone. The last part of me to become marble. The very last.~
@407  = ~It's horrible, Branwen. Please, stop.~
@408  = ~Go on.~
@409  = ~And that gnome stood by your side and did nothing...~
@410  = ~He calls me a Princess of the North. Call me a Queen, a Goddess, a Dragon. Call me anything you want, buffoon. You are running out of time to find a buyer. Very soon, your pathetic scroll will be useless for me. The transformation is almost complete. Will it rain?~
@411  = ~Why have you told me all this?~
@412  = ~I am so sorry... I wish I could rescue you earlier.~
@413  = ~It's over. Nobody will attempt to turn you to stone ever again.~
@414  = ~*Branwen comes out of her trance and smiles at you.*~
@415  = ~These misdeeds are past and gone, <CHARNAME>. I was twisted, yet not broken; cast out, yet not fully abandoned. I pray to Tempus, and my battle cry seems to shatter the skies. I look at you, and my heart is filled with joy.~
@416  = ~Flesh to stone. Stone to flesh. Every trickster and magician is capable of the former, but it takes the master to achieve the latter, and a man to succeed in earnest. A man who stands in front of me.~
@417  = ~Where is this bastard? I'll have his hide!~
@418  = ~My lady Branwen, I am flattered beyond words.~
@419  = ~Whatever, just do not tell anyone. I'm not much into "Stone to flesh", rather "Flesh to shreds and ribbons".~
@420  = ~No, 'twas you I had in mind.~
@421  = ~'Tis I who should be flattered by your care and attention.~
@422  = ~Fervor of bloodlust makes your eyes aglow, within battle or without. However, you malign yourself by insistence 'tis your only passion.~
@423  = ~But the shadows grow longer as we speak. Let us continue on our way, <CHARNAME>.~
@424  = ~The skies here are different from those over Norheims. Do you know what I was doing last night? I was counting stars and giving them names. I even considered calling one after you. Take a guess, <CHARNAME>, and tell me - which star was it?~
@425  = ~Mystra's star? Though it's my preference to think about you while watching it: it is so bright, so beautiful...~
@426  = ~Ieryn - the star of the North?~
@427  = ~Shaundral? An erratic star, brightest before disaster? Like me, whose coming was foretold in Alaundo's prophecies?~
@428  = ~King's Coin? The star of the rulers for Men, and the Kingslayer to Elves? Do you think I am destined for greatness, or great failure?~
@429  = ~I do not know, Branwen. Will you tell me?~
@430  = ~Mystra's star? Its blue soft light is pleasant to behold. Mayhap I would have picked it, if I indeed had to choose.~
@431  = ~Ever present, ever constant? The one guiding my steps when I am lost? I could have chosen it, I admit.~
@432  = ~Some might say that it is indeed a fitting star for you, <CHARNAME>. But I do not see its ominous light reflected in your eyes.~
@433  = ~You are too dramatic for your own good, <CHARNAME>. Whatever your destiny, I hope you won't know a great fall. The darker fame of Kingslayer among the Elves is too sinister to give it to you.~
@434  = ~You are a wise one, <CHARNAME>, for it was a tricky question.~
@435  = ~When I was looking at the sky yesterday, I suddenly realized that every star reminded me of you. Then I thought that everything which is fair and dear to my heart is somehow connected to you. You are in my frosted breath in the early morning, and in the tune I whistle when I wake. You are my sun and stars... I'm afraid you are becoming my world.~
@436  = ~Yes, you should be afraid of your love for me. I know, one day I will harvest simple 'I love you' from your lips, undressed and unadorned. I yearn for that day.~
@437  = ~Too many fancy words, Branwen. Do give me a more material declaration of your feelings for me. The night grows long, and we do need some sleep afterwards.~
@438  = ~Now you have me wondering: what star I should name for you? I guess that I will stay up all night, poring over that task. I wonder, why the poor and rich alike in these parts stock their bookshelves with endless copies of the "History of the North"? I'd much rather fancy to see a "Star Lore" book somewhere...~
@439  = ~And I am yearning for a bedroll right now. Care to join me there? You have not embraced me for far too long, my lazy lover.~
@440  = ~*laughs* It can be as long or as short as you wish, <CHARNAME>. But I remember that on occasion you are prepared to forsake your sleep. So, what are you waiting for? Care to join me? You have not embraced me for far too long, my lazy lover.~
@441  = ~By Tempus, I have created a monster! If you wish to begin your very own star lore book right now, I can help you, I suppose. Alternatively, you may join me in my bedroll. I would like to bring to your attention that you have not embraced me for far too long, my lazy lover.~
@442  = ~This clumsy butchery we're practicing is disgusting! The battle takes finesse and skill, not only the steel and muscle! Why should I have to endure the sight of mangled corpses, when a clean cut separates the head from the body?~
@443  = ~Branwen, what happened to you? You were the first to crush ribs, rip limbs apart, and bring your former enemies to life as animated corpses, all in the name of Tempus!~
@444  = ~I thought you liked bloodshed.~
@445  = ~Agreed. We'll attempt only clean kills from now on.~
@446  = ~I enjoy slaying, maiming, crashing and chopping my enemies to bits, so it will continue.~
@447  = ~Yes... No! <CHARNAME>, this is not what I had in mind.~
@448  = ~Nothing could have been sweeter to me than driving my hammer up an orc's gullet or skewering a stray bandit, 'tis true. But there has come a time for change.~
@449  = ~I confess, my own lust for blood and gore has diminished. I feel softer and gentler by day, <CHARNAME>. 'Tis a curse...~
@450  = ~Tempus is displeased with me, I can tell. I am losing my zest for battle, and I know the reason. We both do.~
@451  = ~Yes, you've mellowed a little. But is it that bad?~
@452  = ~I have noticed it, too. Is it because of me? Of us?~
@453  = ~And the reason is our love, isn't it?~
@454  = ~I have no idea what you're talking about.~
@455  = ~Would you consider ripping your still beating and bleeding heart from your body 'bad'? 'Tis worse than 'bad', <CHARNAME>.~
@456  = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, you guessed wisely. It is.~
@457  = ~I am talking about force mighty but idle. The force inspiring and uplifting, but leading to stagnation and decay if put above all. Love, <CHARNAME>. Our love.~
@458  = ~I was born to serve Tempus; I felt battle cry on my lips more oft than a lover's mouth. Now, however, I am plagued by self-doubt as frequently as an old tree suffers the assaults of insects and worms, crawling and slithering all over its body. These words are harsh, <CHARNAME>, but I'm afraid you would not understand if I spoke in dainty and flowery terms.~
@459  = ~And what are you planning to do? Leave me?~
@460  = ~Do you love me at all, Branwen?~
@461  = ~Branwen, do not lose hope. We shall fight your doubts together, and we'll emerge victorious.~
@462  = ~Your self-whipping is piteous, Branwen. Have some backbone!~
@463  = ~You compared our love with... worms? No, we are through, you and I.~
@464  = ~'Twould be the worst treachery imaginable. No, <CHARNAME>, I shall help you defeat your foes with the same ardor I have displayed before. But... I have doubts about what comes then.~
@465  = ~<CHARNAME>, I desire to spend days by your side in battle, and nights in your bedroll. I would give my life for you in a moment's notice, and I expect neither praise nor sacrifices in return. If 'tis not love, then I do not know what is.~
@466  = ~If you say it, <CHARNAME>. I trust you more than I trust myself.~
@467  = ~*sigh* You are likely correct. Mayhap I tend to see gullibility where I should see steadfast and devout faith. I'll turn to Tempus, and ask for his guidance.~
@468  = ~As you wish. 'Tis for the best.~
@469  = ~But we have tarried here overlong. Come, <CHARNAME>, let us continue on our victorious path. Mayhap the night of quiet reading, prayer and your kisses will ease my doubts and banish my worries.~
@470  = ~*reads to you from an old tome* "And His Grace the King came then upon Sir Knight and the Queen. They were asleep on his cloak shielded by the branches of an ancient oak tree. Sir Knight's great sword lay between them, and so the King saw that his honor was not despoiled. His Grace kneeled and slipped his own ring onto his Lady's finger, and then he rode off..."~
@471  = ~I am not sure I am truly convinced in the efficiency of that sword. Be there a blade between us or not, you will not be safe from my embrace. But I have heard of a ranger who used a dire wolf for that purpose. That might be more efficient.~
@472  = ~Sounds like a thing Kivan would do, if some lady imagined she could replace his dear Deheriana. It would be a hamster in Minsc's case, I guess.~
@473  = ~That sounds dangerous - a sword in the bedroll. Someone could get hurt.~
@474  = ~Ahem, Branwen, do you think we can delay the story's ending till tomorrow night? I am afraid my endurance is lacking, compared to that of Sir Knight.~
@475  = ~That is a tale to warm up a noble heart.~
@476  = ~Does a dire wolf sound better to you?~
@477  = ~At least it is softer. And warmer.~
@478  = ~Depends. Did it work for that ranger?~
@479  = ~I think not. You are all I need this eve.~
@480  = ~Glad I am to hear that, <CHARNAME>. I was wondering how long it would take you to figure out that I had not yet been kissed tonight.~
@481  = ~How about warming up our bed, as well?~
@482  = ~No, it did not. His lady was just as persistent as I am. I hope you will follow his noble example and join me under the covers now.~
@483  = ~The name of a ranger in question was Jon. But do you imply 'tis a typical demeanor for rangers?~
@484  = ~Rangers are passionate lovers, don't you agree?~
@485  = ~I do not know, Branwen. But my own behavior in this situation would differ greatly, I assure you.~
@486  = ~Why, the hero of my dreams, Drizzt Do'Urden, would have done the same!~
@487  = ~Hmm, you were talking about rangers, and I was thinking of those I chanced to meet. No, wait, I forgot Drizzt Do'Urden! Ahem, bad example, I am afraid.~
@488  = ~Absolutely true, <CHARNAME>. Do you think we can delay the story's ending till tomorrow night? And do some serious research on the ways the rangers love?~
@489  = ~'Tis a bad example, <CHARNAME>~
@490  = ~Bad example indeed, <CHARNAME>~
@491  = ~Have you ever heard about the courtesan in Waterdeep who approached him thinking he was sufficiently drunk? Not only did Drizzt politely refuse her nineteen times, but on the twentieth he set his ale aside, pulled out his diary, and started reading her an excerpt on the chivalry and 'honorable' ways of love! They say that poor girl refuses to enter that inn ever since.~
@492  = ~Oh dear. What a fop!~
@493  = ~Branwen, that... that cannot be true!~
@494  = ~Shall we keep talking about that Drow, or delay it till tomorrow night? I am afraid my endurance is lacking, compared to that of Sir Knight or Drizzt.~
@495  = ~Mayhap the tale is a tad embellished, but I have heard it from a very reliable source. But 'tis late already. Could we not forgo this discussion, and do some research on the ways of love, instead?~
@496  = ~'Twill not pass.~
@497  = ~What? Branwen, what are you talking about?~
@498  = ~Is it about your doubts again?~
@499  = ~We've no time for talk now, Branwen. Let us move on.~
@500  = ~I've told you the other day of the malady that afflicted my thoughts. Have you forgotten already?~
@501  = ~Should I ask Tempus for aid and advice, then? Very well, so be it.~
@502  = ~My thoughts turned to our current path, and I found it barren and unsatisfying. Not your path, surely. Your destiny is bright and promising, and foes flee your wrath in most disgraceful and hurried manner. 'Twas my failures I was repulsed with, for I neglected my duties greatly. I no longer revel in righteous battles, and neither do I seek proving myself in Tempus' eyes. I spend hours awake stroking your hair and dreading the moment you stir, because it would mean another march, and another battle. I have come to fear death, while months before, every day was a fine day to die.~
@503  = ~I must flee you, <CHARNAME>. You have damned me with weakness, if unwillingly, and I cannot let it spread and consume me..~
@504  = ~It will only do you good in the long run, Branwen. We shall eventually marry, settle down, have children...~
@505  = ~Branwen, my love, calm down. You are making an avalanche out of a single snowflake.~
@506  = ~Is your heart not big enough to house both your faith and my love?~
@507  = ~Why should it trouble you so? There is place for everything, Branwen, for the hatred in battle as well as for warmth and comfort at night.~
@508  = ~Certainly, Branwen. Do as you will.~
@509  = ~Ugh. No, <CHARNAME>, I would gladly follow the road you open with your words, but 'tis not destined for me, not while I'm still able to hold my sword arm steady and true.~
@510  = ~Tempus grants me wisdom to see things as they are, <CHARNAME>, and I see that I cannot shrug these changes, or wave them away.~
@511  = ~<CHARNAME>, a true follower of Tempus should embrace conflict, not shrink from the challenge; harness the battle and be made stronger for it, not tremble in fear for herself and her lover.~
@512  = ~You are truly a man of noble stance and generous spirit, <CHARNAME>. I thank you most heartily... and I will always remember you in my prayers. Fare you well.~
@513  = ~But no, 'twas a mistake to inflict my troubles upon you. 'Tis time alone I need, to purge my doubts and settle my thoughts. I shall sleep by myself tonight.~
@514  = ~<CHARNAME>, I have come to a decision, and 'tis important that you listen to me. It relieves me to share it with you, for now I am whole and calm, and in a strange way, born again.~
@515  = ~I shall stay with you. Tempus' hand shall guide you through your battles, and my prayer will shield you from most serious injuries and harms. But there is nothing to come between us, save camaraderie, and most likely, I shall depart once bards choir the first ballad telling of the Hero of the Sword Coast.~
@516  = ~I accept this. You are more than welcome to stay, my friend.~
@517  = ~You are a coward, Branwen! You are scared of embracing our love! Now, what would Tempus say about that?~
@518  = ~But I love you, Branwen. I simply cannot go on without you.~
@519  = ~Why, why would you do this?~
@520  = ~I cannot take this. You must leave, Branwen.~
@521  = ~Thank you, comrade.~
@522  = ~'Twas not my intent to torment you, but I see I've done so anyway. <CHARNAME>, if you wish, I shall leave.~
@523  = ~Yes, leave, Branwen.~
@524  = ~No, stay... my friend.~
@525  = ~I only wish I could find words which would make you reconsider...~
@526  = ~I wish you well, <CHARNAME>. Mayhap there'll come a day when we fight side by side, bound by pure and unyielding friendship. Until then, goodbye.~
@527  = ~No, <CHARNAME>. I am unwavering in my decision.~
@528  = ~The Lord of Battles is... a demanding deity. Valor in battle and bravery are the only things which can solicit his favor. There is no fate more appalling for a Battleguard than be rejected by their god, and Tempus has not been answering my call lately, not until I revealed my decision in my prayers. I owe everything to my god, <CHARNAME>. I suffered for my devotion and survived by his will. I've no right to be weak.~
@529  = ~You are a man and a warrior, you will bear it well. Forgive me for causing you this pain and anxiety, but better say this now, so when the time comes for delivering the last blow to the piteous remains of your bitter foes, your mind will be clear and your hand steady.~
@530  = ~Let us continue our travels, comrade, as friends in earnest, if not lovers in full fervor.~
@531  = ~The air here! So healthful and good-smelling! Cedar, sage, salt, water - everything dear, and familiar, and proper. Your home is a delight for my eyes and nostrils, <CHARNAME>.~
@532  = ~There is more to Candlekeep than the smell of the sea, Branwen.~
@533  = ~I am glad you enjoy it. Shall we go down to the water?~
@534  = ~I've never liked it, to be honest. If I had a choice, I would be living as far from the sea as possible.~
@535  = ~There's no time for chit-chat, Branwen. The leaders of the Iron Throne await.~
@536  = ~I shall follow your lead. 'Tis a pity we cannot walk the coast at our leisure.~
@537  = ~'Twas your sheltering haven and the refuge for years, I remember. But surely this vast and untroubled blue expanse, clear and pristine, stirs something in your memory and heart?~
@538  = ~You slept many a year accompanied by the sea's breath and whispers, <CHARNAME>. 'Tis impossible to detest the sea for you now, not more than 'tis possible to abhor a part of yourself.~
@539  = ~'Twill be a pleasure to feel the splashes and breeze on my face, and white sand under my toes. My kind is well known for our devotion to the sea, <CHARNAME>. It almost equals our zeal for bloodlust and battles. Our lands are marked by numerous woods, moors, and soaring mountains, but sea was and is my foremost love, and closest to my bosom.~
@540  = ~Your foremost love? What of your feelings for me?~
@541  = ~Why do you love the sea so much?~
@542  = ~As it should be. Even your village was called Seawolf.~
@543  = ~It is beautiful, but also dangerous, Branwen. It has undoubtedly claimed many of your kin.~
@544  = ~'Tis different kind of love.~
@545  = ~Steep reefs, driving gales, and starless nights are the worst curse of any helmsman, 'tis true. But Tempus tells us to expect no less. The sea is a conflict within and without, beating at the land violently as a fierce and willful maiden pounces at her rejected beau. Through conflict comes evolution and change, <CHARNAME>. Storms may grant us death, but also instill life and betterment.~
@546  = ~Sea is... majestic, and eternal. Neither crystal blue lakes amongst sprawling forests of pine, nor most tender caresses of a devoted lover can compare to its splendor and grace. 'Tis sad but inspiring that her everlasting beauty will gladden someone's eye long after we're gone.~
@547  = ~By Tempus, I'll not let this despicable creature live! 'Tis unthinkable to even envision such a vile deed! <CHARNAME>, on my honor I swear: I shall crush the rat's ribs and chop him to pieces, to reclaim the potion required, and I shall do so in honest battle, not in the lowly and cowardly manner.~
@548  = ~Actually, you're welcome to do it in any manner you like. In this case, the ends justify the means.~
@549  = ~Yes, Branwen. We shall keep our honor, not debase ourselves to their level.~
@550  = ~Let's just find Marek, and quick. I do not wish anything to happen to you.~
@551  = ~Oh, gods, we are to die, aren't we? I'm so scared... I am POISONED! I WILL DIE! NO!!!~
@552  = ~There may be truth in your words, <CHARNAME>, but they fill me with foreboding. Should we stray from the righteous path so easily?~
@553  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I'll restrain myself until then.~
@554  = ~'Tis heartening and inspiriting that you worry so, <CHARNAME>. But 'tis also troubling.~
@555  = ~*cringe* Cease, you nauseate me. How could I take a gutless worm for a man?~
@556  = ~I confess, I am uneasy about the outcome of the oncoming battle. Severely weakened as we are, a stray robber may try his luck with us and succeed, let alone an able scoundrel. Such thoughts are almost dishonorable for a priestess of Tempus, but I yield to them, for I am afraid for you. 'Tis an unfitting and unwelcome change, <CHARNAME>, and frightening.~
@557  = ~Branwen, it is natural that we worry about each other. We are in love.~
@558  = ~It is only temporary, Branwen. When you're cured of the poison, you'll become yourself again, I'm sure.~
@559  = ~You must steel yourself. If I cannot rely on you, how shall we continue?~
@560  = ~Yes, but the hour of battle is not the proper time to think of soft and tender things.~
@561  = ~I must disagree. I am worried that the change is permanent.~
@562  = ~My heart is not set of stone, <CHARNAME>. Were I able to squeeze it tightly and firmly, so it stopped beating so fast and unsure, I would, but 'tis impossible.~
@563  = ~But we speak of ill omens, while the deadly peril is afoot. Let is deliver the blow, boldly and openly, so the craven weakling perceives it before he falls.~
@564  = ~*You come awake and hear Branwen's chant.*~
@565  = ~Tempus, tonight a thousand of young warriors will ask for you to cast your glance their way, a hundred of priests dressed in ritual robes will pray to you, a dozen of sturdy men will roar your name in their bloody toils, hoping for your blessing. And among many words that reach your ears tonight, I, Branwen of Seawolf, ask you to listen to my words. My prayer is not for me, but for a man of valor, a man tormented. He has endured many trials, and I fear he will face many more before he is through. Give him strength, Tempus, such as no other man has.~
@566  = ~Branwen? Were your prayers... for me?~
@567  = ~Branwen, what do you think you are doing?~
@568  = ~You are awake? *laughs* A stupid question, really. Of course you are. I was praying for you. You... do not mind, do you?~
@569  = ~I do not, but it is not necessary. My god watches over me, Branwen.~
@570  = ~No, of course not. Thank you, Branwen. I did not know that you cared so much.~
@571  = ~Branwen, do you not understand? I am not tormented, I am not cursed! I am who I am, a child of Bhaal, and I am ready to face my destiny. I do not need your prayers, or your pity!~
@572  = ~My kind lady. Thank you.~
@573  = ~*Branwen comes near you and brushes hair aside from your forehead gently.*~
@574  = ~Branwen, that's enough! You are acting like a mother hen! I do not need your prayers, or your pity!~
@575  = ~I know that, <CHARNAME>.~
@576  = ~Yes, I do care for you, <CHARNAME>.~
@577  = ~You cannot forbid me to feel. I did not know that the fact that someone is concerned about your wellbeing would upset you so. But have it your own way: I shall say no more.~
@578  = ~<CHARNAME>, do not thank me. I did nothing out of the ordinary. I am a priest, and it is my duty to pray for those I care for.~
@579  = ~*Branwen walks away.*~
@580  = ~But I fear for you sometimes.~
@581  = ~Do you fear for me, or do you fear of me?~
@582  = ~Do not fear for me, Branwen. I am not tormented, I am not cursed! I am who I am, a child of Bhaal, and I am ready to face my destiny. I do not need your prayers, or your pity!~
@583  = ~You know, that's getting too weird. Let me say you a "good morning", and let's forget the whole thing.~
@584  = ~I never feared you.~
@585  = ~Some would say you should.~
@586  = ~I am glad to hear that, Branwen. It is pleasant, for a change. With all those rumors floating around the Sword Coast, I guess that I am mentioned more often in a curse than in a prayer.~
@587  = ~*smile* Good morning to you, then.~
@588  = ~They can say all they want, those others. Sometimes, when I hear old crows trading dark stories about you, I wish to cast a silence spell. But I am no crow. I know you, and I trust my heart. I am not afraid of you, <CHARNAME>.~
@589  = ~The time for battle is nigh, <CHARNAME>. Are you ready?~
@590  = ~Does it concern you? You are not involved with me any longer, Branwen. You said so yourself.~
@591  = ~Yes, I am. Are you still coming with me?~
@592  = ~No, but the time for choice is long past.~
@593  = ~Ready or not, it is time to go.~
@594  = ~To battle, then. To victory!~
@595  = ~True. Both of us have made our choices, and already I feel the consequences of mine.~
@596  = ~I will follow wherever you lead, and give you my unwavering aid and support without hesitation. You know it full well.~
@597  = ~But, as I said, we shall part as soon as this evil, bloodthirsty animal, Sarevok, is brought down by our blades. 'Tis inevitable, <CHARNAME>.~
@598  = ~I... I hoped you would change your mind.~
@599  = ~Is there anything I can do to make you stay?~
@600  = ~I know, Branwen, and I understand.~
@601  = ~I have not. Mayhap I will live to regret it, but until then I am sure 'tis a right choice to make.~
@602  = ~No, comrade. I will have my leave-taking, with your approval and blessing, or without it.~
@603  = ~'Twas my hope you would. Thank you, my friend.~
@604  = ~Many perils and battles lay before you, and you must face them in full strength, not tamed and mellowed as a silly bard in love with a village merchant's daughter. You have the strength, you have the ability and posture to handle whatever is hurled at you.~
@605  = ~I wish you well on your way.~
@606  = ~You're not exactly raising my spirits with your words.~
@607  = ~I will do well, for you and others believing in me. I promise.~
@608  = ~A true warrior does not need mere words to ascertain his victory, and you are of the best and bravest. Be strong, stand steady, and, Tempus willing, your enemies will be in humiliation and defeat.~
@609  = ~I hail you, <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, and I am proud to have assisted you, and to have stood by your side.~
@610  = ~Now, enough said. Let your actions speak louder than words. To battle, <CHARNAME>! To victory!~
@611  = ~*Branwen slowly turns her head, and her gaze falls on you.*~ [X#BLANK]
@612  = ~*She sighs, and her eyes flash back to the trail.* <CHARNAME>, I'm bored. Would that a bloody battle awaited us ahead!~
@613  = ~*Branwen is fumbling with her hammer, trying to attach it to her belt. As you stare, it slips down her hip to her front, dangling there in most indecent manner. She smirks at you before adjusting the weapon back into its place, and her face is definitely redder than normal.* ~
@614  = ~*She elbows you playfully.* You've been glancing in my direction oft, <CHARNAME>. 'Twould do you good to pay heed to the shadows to the front and sides, as well.~
@615  = ~*She takes your hand gently, her fingers and palm robust, but her movements soothing.* You've suffered many losses recently, comrade. May Tempus strengthen your spirit for the battles to come.~
@616  = ~*An almost empty water-skin hangs on her side. Branwen shakes it energetically, and topples it over her generously open mouth. The contents pour between her eager lips, but a single drop traces a line down her jaw and stops, sparkling tantalizingly, at the nape of her neck.*~
@617  = ~*wipe it off*~
@618  = ~*lick it off* ~
@619  = ~Branwen, you've got a water drop on your neck.~
@620  = ~*do nothing*~
@621  = ~Thank you, my friend. 'Tis a curse how clumsy I may be at times.~
@622  = ~*laughs* By Tempus, you are thirsty!~
@623  = ~Let it stay there, <CHARNAME>. 'Tis a hot tenday, and some cool water is a blessing indeed.~
@624  = ~*She hums a slow and beautiful melody, a surprisingly gentle tune. Noticing your attention, Branwen smiles.* 'Tis a Norheim lullaby, <CHARNAME>. I confess, I miss my mother a lot.~
@625  = ~*Branwen reaches out her hand and strokes your forearm, feeling your biceps.* You are a strong warrior. I respect that.~
@626  = ~*She winks and presses close to you for a moment, before walking away.*~
@627  = ~*Branwen frowns, examining your wounds.* Your negligence of your own injuries - 'tis disturbing at best. Stand still, <CHARNAME>.~
@628  = ~*She lays her palms upon your shoulders and starts to knead your tired muscles. Within moments, the warm, relaxing sensation creeps up to the back of your neck, releasing pains so old you're barely aware of them. At last, she kisses you on the cheek and walks away.* ~
@629  = ~*Branwen laughs to herself, her hearty chuckle so catching that you have a momentary desire to join her.* 'Tis an old joke I've just remembered. "You don't argue about the taste - you chop down the scoundrel whose taste differs from yours!"~
@630  = ~*She smiles at you, a strangely shy smile for a loud and outspoken battle priestess.* I have come to enjoy your company. Thank you for letting me travel with you.~
@631  = ~*A single white blossom rests on her palm. Branwen looks at it thoughtfully, then approaches you and attaches the flower to the collar of your cloak.* For luck, <CHARNAME>.~
@632  = ~*Branwen looks drawn, but as she stares at you, her face relaxes into a graceful smile.* I'm not tired as such, my friend. The day has been long and hard, but there are still battles ahead.~
@633  = ~We are not far from the sea, now. If we have time, I'd like to inhale the sea air once more.~
@634  = ~*Branwen yawns and stretches.* 'Tis shameful to admit, but I am tired.~
@635  = ~Your travelling garb could do with a good measure of cleaning, comrade. Should we come by a good inn with hot water abound, I shall arrange it for you.~
@636  = ~*Branwen is chopping an apple with a small knife and guiding the pieces to her mouth, one by one. The enjoyment she is displaying at such a simple activity is almost childish, but warm and appealing just the same.*~
@637  = ~Do you want a bite, <CHARNAME>?~
@638  = ~Yes, thank you, Branwen.~
@639  = ~I'll pass.~
@640  = ~*Branwen smiles and offers the last piece of the apple to you.*~
@641  = ~Very well. *She swallows the remaining piece.* ~
@642  = ~*Branwen is inspecting her armor with a slight frown. Next moment, she scowls heavily, as she notices a large, greasy stain on her breast. With a deep grunt, she tries to mop it off, and you are granted several minutes of quite an impressive sight, as both her hands are working up her bosom, and her chest is swelling heavily.*~
@643  = ~Mayhap you'll find some time to tell me more of Candlekeep? I admit, I am curious.~
@644  = ~*Branwen weighs her hammer in her hand.* On my honor as a Battleguard I swear: no bandit will slip past unsuspected.~
@645  = ~*Branwen kisses you on the cheek and smirks.* 'Tis good that we met before some harpy or another seduced you in her lap.~
@646  = ~*Her hands slip up your chest and to your shoulders, twining around the nape of your neck. Then her full, rich lips meet yours, while her eyes continue drinking in your image. Seemingly satisfied with both the kiss and your features' examination, Branwen steps back, grinning widely.* My hot, seductive lover... I'll welcome you in my bedroll this eve.~
@647  = ~*Branwen twines her fingers with yours, and you walk hand in hand for a while.*~
@648  = ~*Her arm, while broad and trained, feels small against yours.*~
@649  = ~*She makes an awkward step, and next moment she is on the ground, clutching her leg and groaning slightly. Then her moan turns into a growl.* By Auril's knickers, I'm not a brainless princess out of a stupid book!~
@650  = ~*Branwen lightly touches her seemingly twisted ankle with a pair of fingers, and cool blue light emanates from her fingertips. In a matter of seconds, she is up and smiling.* Shall we continue, <CHARNAME>?~
@651  = ~Our battle prowess is amazing. Soon, all our foes, mighty and small, will be crushed!~
@652  = ~*She steps into your embrace and hugs you fiercely.* Your company gladdens and eases my heart. Tempus willing, it shall always be so.~
@653  = ~You look thin, <CHARNAME>. Some bread and cheese, perhaps? *Branwen offers you a heavily buttered loaf of bread, with small pieces of cheese piled on top of it.* ~
@654  = ~Thank you, Branwen, but I'm not hungry.~
@655  = ~Looks good! Here, give it to me.~
@656  = ~It's greasy and heavy, Branwen. How come you are able to eat such primitive foods?~
@657  = ~As you wish. *She looks disappointed, and absently tosses the bread to her backpack.* ~
@658  = ~*Branwen chuckles at your eagerness and hands you the bread.*~
@659  = ~'Tis unwise to be squeamish on the road, <CHARNAME>. But as you wish.~
@660  = ~I feel Tempus is displeased with my actions. I must prove to him that our frolics and romps are in truth feelings deep and honest, and do not diminish my worship and devotion to the Lord of Battles. *Branwen frowns, looking at you. It looks as she herself is doubting it.*~
@661  = ~*She tilts her head, regarding your posture.* I am indeed lucky to have chosen well.~
@662  = ~*Branwen clutches her head, frowning.* 'Twas unwise to drink so much last eve. These elderberry wines of the mainland are much more unkind to the gullet than soft, balmy meads of my homeland.~
@663  = ~*She presses to your side and lays her chin on your shoulder. For a few moments, you stand embraced, her hot, steady breath on your cheek, and her hands massaging your chest. Then Branwen gives your hip a playful slap and walks away.*~
@664  = ~*Branwen throws her arms around you and laughs, her hair streaming around her face.*~
@665  = ~*kiss Branwen passionately*~
@666  = ~*give Branwen a light peck on the cheek*~
@667  = ~*She is eager to respond, and you experience the most peculiar sensation, as her hot lips hungrily press on yours, and her right arm, still holding a hammer, wraps around your neck, giving you cold prickle every time the cold metal touches your bare skin.*~
@668  = ~Bah, <CHARNAME>! Was it the best you could do? *She kisses you fiercely.*~
@669  = ~*Branwen looks at you expectantly, then shrugs and resumes her place in formation.* ~
@670  = ~*She is staring at your backside, clearly impressed with what she sees. At last, she gives a whistle, winks and walks away.*~
@671  = ~*Branwen caresses your cheek, her face suddenly sad, as if you were leaving.* 'Tis good, <CHARNAME>. What we have... 'twas long ago that I felt so calm and happy.~
@672  = ~You seem to live with the present, only. 'Tis time to think of the future battles, and of the worthier fate than a backwater mercenary and hero.~
@673  = ~*It is raining heavily, and your cloak slowly but surely becomes damp and heavy, slowing you down. Branwen, however, continues at a light, purposeful stride, her own cloak fluttering behind her, seemingly still dry. Noticing your interest, she winks.* We Rauthymar are used to walking in the rain without getting wet, <CHARNAME>. 'Tis close to magic, I know, but should you have seen the unceasing summer storms of my homeland, you would understand 'tis not possible to survive in the Norheim isles without some unique strengths within.~
@674  = ~*She frowns at you mockingly.* Tempus does not need flowers laid at his shrine, but I do. 'Twas nearly a tenday since you tempted me with some.~
@675  = ~<CHARNAME>, you are pale yet again. What troubles you?~
@676  = ~My enemies, Branwen. What else?~
@677  = ~I miss Gorion.~
@678  = ~Nothing. I am fine.~
@679  = ~Yes, there are some things, but I'd rather not discuss them right now.~
@680  = ~I understand, my friend. Here, let me chase away these thoughts with a warm and tight embrace. You deserve it, my brave warrior.~
@681  = ~Well... if you say so. *She smiles at you before walking away.*~
@682  = ~*Branwen twirls the amulet dangling between her breasts, and casts wayward glances at you. The small green-blue stone sparkles playfully, and, together with the glimpse of her fine fingers and tantalizing curves of her chest, it creates quite an impression.* ~
@683  = ~*Obviously bored with displaying her charms, she smiles and lets go of the amulet, taking your hands instead. Silently, Branwen raises her face to meet yours in a long, deep and probing kiss.*~
@684  = ~I love you, <CHARNAME>. 'Tis no secret, isn't it? ~
@685  = ~My lady Branwen, it is a grave indiscretion I am going to commit, but are you going to sanctify your union with <CHARNAME>? If you need assistance in finding a priest who is to perform the ritual, I am ever at your service.~
@686  = ~There is no need to trouble yourself, Ajantis. Mere formalities do not matter to me.~
@687  = ~I am amazed at your relaxed attitude towards this subject, my lady. Would you not consider strengthening the natural bond of a man and a woman by the traditional bond of marriage?~
@688  = ~My spirit is guarded by the Lord of Battles, and he knows better. If Tempus has not admonished me for my decision, then idle whisperings behind my back do not worry me.~
@689  = ~I will pray to Helm that you change your mind, my friend. A decision like this should not be made lightly.~
@690  = ~And to think that you could have had me... Your loss, Branwen.~
@691  = ~Not that I ever wanted your ilk, but I doubt you are truly lost to me. Women involved with other men hold a special place in your heart.~
@692  = ~Not involved with, tempestuous priestess, merely wed.~
@693  = ~As close as makes no difference.~
@694  = ~Ah, I've forgotten that you have no head for subtleties. Why should I ask Celanil's favor for someone who is already in love and loved, thusly already blessed by her? It is the women who think that they are forever locked in a loveless union, which you humans seem to create time and again for inconceivable reasons, that I seek out and gift with love. ~
@695  = ~A charitable man, you are. ~
@696  = ~We each serve our own deity the best way we can, no? ~
@697  = ~Why, not only are you a fount of handsomeness, dexterous and witty, but a spiritual man besides! 'Tis a shame I must decline your proffers.~
@698  = ~*Laughs* You are a hopeless liar, Branwen. Be happy, sweetling, with your <CHARNAME>. I will say a prayer to Celanil if you put a word in for me with Tempus.~
@699  = ~So, the monkey priestess has found herself a simian consort. (Pathetic, really.)~
@700  = ~Mind your own affairs, mageling. ~
@701  = ~Oh, unlike you, I do have affairs to manage. (Affairs that you all would do well to stay out of.) You, on the other hand, look as though you are able to think of nothing but romping in the treetops with <CHARNAME>. I do not doubt that peeling bananas is the height of your current intellectual activity.~
@702  = ~Were it that your fires and lightning bolts had been as quick as your tongue, wizard, you may have gained a touch of respect. As it is, you are more hindrance than help in our journeys.~
@703  = ~Bah! These mundane tasks you are talking about are clearly beneath the unsurpassable magic of Edwin Odesseiron, and I won't touch them with a sharp stick, even if asked nicely. ~
@704  = ~Then I do not doubt that you'll soon be dismissed. ~
@705  = ~Doubt it not, doubt it not... (When will she go away? The smell is beginning to grind on my nerves! How our renowned leader stands it I do not want to even imagine...)~
@706  = ~Tell me, Branwen, why did you chose <CHARNAME> as your mate?~
@707  = ~<CHARNAME> is valiant, strong of spirit and easy on the eyes.~
@708  = ~And a pack leader.~
@709  = ~Yes, 'tis true. But above all - ~
@710  = ~Why don't I feel the need to mate with him? ~
@711  = ~What? ~
@712  = ~<CHARNAME> is the alpha-male in our pack, but I don't feel the need to lay with him or fight you for him. And you are no stronger than me.~
@713  = ~Listen to what I was about to say, Faldorn: above all, I took <CHARNAME> as my mate, because my heart chose him, and he loved me in return. Yours just.. didn't.~
@714  = ~Heart?! The heart is to pump blood around the body, by Silvanus' acorns! It has no business to command it!~
@715  = ~Perhaps you are more of a human than you let on, Faldorn. ~
@716  = ~Woe to me! I will end up like a measly town-dweller wishing for an inferior male because of this "heart's" whim!~
@717  = ~Be at ease: there is no danger of you ever being taken for one, Faldorn. And, just in case you decide to reassert your wild nature - choose another alpha-male. This one is mine. ~
@718  = ~Grr! You're showing your teeth! Perhaps *you* are more of a wild beast than you let on.~
@719  = ~I have started writing a ballad about you and <CHARNAME>. Do you want to hear it, Branwen?~
@720  = ~Absolutely not. 'Tis private, and I'll not have anybody slandering our names along the Sword Coast in a vulgar and base manner.~
@721  = ~But <CHARNAME> is a hero! Maybe a legend in the making! Don't you want to be a part of the legend?~
@722  = ~'Tis my greatest desire, dear bard, but I wish to be memorized as <CHARNAME>'s stalwart companion, not as a mere dalliance. And much as I appreciate your writing skill, the latter 'twill surely be.~
@723  = ~*sigh* Yes, m'lady. ~
@724  = ~Hehe, Branwen, gotcha! You were combing yer hair!~
@725  = ~Why does it surprise you?~
@726  = ~'Cuz you were doing it in front of <CHARNAME>! Ya wanted him to notice, didn't ya? Didn't ya? *giggle* You know, it was even kinda cute. ~
@727  = ~*blushes* Yes, well... let's get going, shall we?~
@728  = ~Nah, I'm not letting ya go until you admit that you're really in love with him and want to stay with him forever and ever and ever! ~
@729  = ~Imoen...~
@730  = ~Say it!~
@731  = ~Imoen, child, let me go!~
@732  = ~Not a chance! Aw, c'mon! He'd like to hear it, too, ya know. ~
@733  = ~*sigh* All right. I do care for <CHARNAME>.~
@734  = ~She did it! <CHARNAME>, did you hear that? She did it!~
@735  = ~Whatever.~
@736  = ~It is good to see you s-smiling, Branwen.~
@737  = ~Thank you, Khalid. I confess, I have been walking as if in the bright sunshine lately.~
@738  = ~Does it have to do with <CHARNAME>?~
@739  = ~It shows clearly, does it not? Yes, 'twas <CHARNAME> I was thinking of.~
@740  = ~I have seen you regarding each other, and it is a truly t-taking sight. I wish you much happiness, Branwen. ~
@741  = ~Thank you again, my friend. ~
@742  = ~Kivan, I seek advice from you.~
@743  = ~I shall help to the best of my knowledge, Branwen.~
@744  = ~Your wife... did her presence inspire you in battle?~
@745  = ~A man who enters the battle with love in his heart that is greater than his love of himself would not waver and fail, where a man who knows no such joy could.~
@746  = ~Why do you ask?~
@747  = ~'Tis in my mind a nagging and pestilent thought which poisons my love for <CHARNAME>. "A warrior's passion should lie on the battlefield only", it says.~
@748  = ~Do not let it poison your happiness: your passion for <CHARNAME>, and the fire you display in battle - they are both manifestations of your true heart.~
@749  = ~*sigh* Mayhap you're right. 'Tis foolish to become an easy prey for all-devouring doubts, in any case.~
@750  = ~If you love life, Branwen, do not forbid yourself to love a man for the sake of valor on the battlefield, or for duty. In this way one becomes a serf to death.~
@751  = ~I smell romance in the air. Branwen, dear, has your heart finally melted in <CHARNAME>'s embrace? Good for you. I would not mind to have his ear, myself, but it is yours now. You will not misuse your influence, will you?~
@752  = ~Do you honestly think I became impassioned with <CHARNAME> only to have his ear?~
@753  = ~Did you not? Oh, well. As long as you will not try to claim a bigger share of the profits, dear, we shall do fine.~
@754  = ~Branwen, leave this male trash alone. Do you need a man in your bedroll to prove your worth? Be in his employ, as I am, but stop licking his boots and warming his loins!~
@755  = ~Is it jealousy I hear, Shar-Teel? No, I suppose you'd look at nobody but a Loki-spawn and butcher, with arms soaked with blood up to his elbows.~
@756  = ~Bah, that at least proves that he can lift his sword. Why bother with the ones who can't and are pig-headed morons, who keep their brains below their belt? ~
@757  = ~<CHARNAME> is nothing like these men. Had your hatred not blinded you, you could have noticed it yourself.~
@758  = ~*spits* Here goes another woman who threw her wits away for a pair of breeches.~
@759  = ~Branwen, what is the point? ~
@760  = ~Eh?~
@761  = ~Instead of lessening your suicidal urges, you multiply them. ~
@762  = ~How so, elfling? ~
@763  = ~Isn't it obvious? Instead of hammering orcish heads, you keep distracting our leader, which speeds our mutual doom. Either the next group of attackers will kill unsuspecting <CHARNAME>, or you will get yourself murdered, which will not improve the morale in this group in the slightest.~
@764  = ~Bah! Speaking of morale, elfling, I am quite sure I am not the one lowering it.~
@765  = ~Priestess, your demeanor is most disturbing! If you do not stop giving me these little looks, I'll make an eggnog out of your eyes!~
@766  = ~You flatter yourself, mageling. 'Tis pity I feel when I look at you. No woman will ever spend as much as a minute with you, let alone a night.~
@767  = ~Preposterous! Just because <CHARNAME> tolerates your aggravating gibes, it does not mean I do! I'd rather go and examine the corpse over there... looks fresh... probably a good supply of spell components, too. Ah, I've always wanted my own pair of dice made of human bones, but Mommy always said 'no'. Tsk, tsk. ~
@768  = ~By Tempus, you are truly insane! ~
@769  = ~Oh, no, no. We cannot have insane people in our group, now, can we? If we do, the Rabbits will come! They will suck out our souls, devour our bodies and put a fabulous Netherese curse on us, so we'll have to wear a leather mask or a spiky armor for the rest of our miserable lives!~
@770  = ~*groan* ~
@771  = ~Does pretty Branwen like my friend <CHARNAME>?~
@772  = ~Yes, good Minsc. 'Tis unfortunate you had a head injury, otherwise, I'm sure, many a maiden would fall for your might and muscle. In fact, I myself...~
@773  = ~I heard that, Branwen!~
@774  = ~You yourself... what? Do continue. ~
@775  = ~'Tis nothing. I cannot help but feel strongly for the great and gentle spirit crushed by a mere blow to the head. Do not hold my earlier words close to the heart, friend Minsc.~
@776  = ~Do not look sad, pretty Branwen. Minsc is happy with his head wound. If Minsc hadn't got wounded, he might never make friends with Boo, and Boo is a better companion than any girl, Boo tells Minsc. ~
@777  = ~*squeak*~ [GAM_48]
