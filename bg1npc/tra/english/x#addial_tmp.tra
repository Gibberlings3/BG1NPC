@0    = ~I must admit, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, when I joined you, I didn't quite imagine we'd have such an, uh, exciting life.~
@1    = ~You thought it would be warm taverns and walks in the countryside?~
@2    = ~I'm glad I can keep you on your toes.~
@3    = ~Be quiet, I don't have time for this.~
@4    = ~I don't do what I do to please you, you know.~
@5    = ~What exactly were you expecting?~
@6    = ~Well, I must admit I wasn't really sure at all... But I didn't imagine I'd be, say, saving the mines of Nashkel from an incursion of kobolds led by a foul cleric of Cyric!~
@7    = ~Are you saying you're scared and want out?~
@8    = ~To tell the truth I never quite know what to expect, either.~
@9    = ~That's the way life is. Less of this yapping. Let's get on to the next adventure.~
@10   = ~Oh, on my toes for sure, and with my nerves on edge sometimes, too!~
@11   = ~To tell the truth, I never quite know what to expect, either.~
@12   = ~Oh, I, uh... Sorry.~
@13   = ~I know that, I was just trying to make conversation! Oh, never mind.~
@14   = ~I'd be lying if I said I was never frightened... But that's part of being an adventurer, right? Facing your fears? Anyway, I, uh, I guess we'd better get a move on.~
@15   = ~Right you are. Let's go face some more of our fears. Onwards!~
@16   = ~Just so long as I know you're not about to bolt at the first sign of trouble. Come on, let's go.~
@17   = ~Well you were right about one thing: moving on. And next time, don't bother me with this sort of rubbish.~
@18   = ~Wandering free, discovering the unknown... Dangerous, but I'm sure you, in particular, would agree that it makes a good tale. Let's go find something else to write about.~
@19   = ~Everywhere we go, we hear tales warning of imminent war... We live in, uh, interesting times. Troubled times, too. ~
@20   = ~Is there a point to this blather? ~
@21   = ~I know what you mean. Still, it means more chance of a good fight!~
@22   = ~Something on your mind?~
@23   = ~That's true enough. The future, it seems, is uncertain.~
@24   = ~Well, I was only making conversation! Next time, maybe, I won't bother.~
@25   = ~Uh... Well, I suppose that's true. I'd like to avoid those sorts of situations where possible, though.~
@26   = ~What's the matter? Are you a coward? ~
@27   = ~Bah! More blood for me then, weakling! ~
@28   = ~To each their own, Garrick.~
@29   = ~Well, I like the occasional bit of excitement, but you're right, too much can leave you feeling a bit tired.~
@30   = ~Well, I like this adventuring and all, don't get me wrong. But I am scared sometimes. There's the thrill of living on the edge, but I never know if I'm going to wake up skewered by a hobgoblin's arrow.~
@31   = ~I knew it, you're a coward! ~
@32   = ~Hmm. Next time I won't bother responding to your musings. Shut. Up.~
@33   = ~I think it's something you have to get used to. Sometimes, I have difficulty facing up to it myself. Still, we have to soldier on. ~
@34   = ~You don't enjoy staring death in the eyes? What about the joys of melee? You can't deny it makes you feel alive, can you? ~
@35   = ~I'd just prefer to live another day, is all. I'm only young, and I'm a lover, not a fighter... Plus I can't very well pen tales when I'm dead, can I? Hmm, unless I was, uh, undead... Creepy.~
@36   = ~Thanks, <CHARNAME>, I'm glad you understand. I guess we'll, uh, just have to get through this together! Well, on to our next adventure, and with luck, not our last!~
@37   = ~Good <PRO_SIRMAAM>, might I ask what made you decide to tread this righteous path?~
@38   = ~It's a topic I do not care to explore. Let's drop the topic until another time, Ajantis.~
@39   = ~Well, I had no particular reason, but one of the fringe benefits is that it's a great way to meet chicks!~
@40   = ~Well, I had no particular reason, but one of the fringe benefits is that it's a great way to meet boys!~
@41   = ~It revolves around a story that I heard as a youngster, about the source of the undead being attributed towards the actions of 13 paladins and how, after a long and tragic battle, 12 of them turned on their colleague, killed him and drank his blood, their reasons being unclear. Then, being ashamed of their actions, they turned and fled, being unable to look upon each other in the full glare of daylight. They lived in an unlife, a decrepit existence, doomed to live off the blood of others.~
@42   = ~That's easy. The ills of humanity are many, and they seep through society like a weeping wound. The true icons of justice and fairness are so few and far between, their influence wanes as soon as they leave an area. I seek to help rectify this.~
@43   = ~*A curious look spreads across Ajantis' face.* Really... might we swap a few tales and err... possible hints and tips from your exploits so far... ?~
@44   = ~To meet... *looks suspiciously at you* My lady, I am sure this is not the main reason you became a paladin. But if you don't want to talk about it now, we can move on and continue our duty.~
@45   = ~I have heard of such a tale, but do you think that such a thing is possible? The poles between each are vast, how can there even be the remotest possibility that there is the same point of origin for them and us?~
@46   = ~Keep in mind that the actual tale itself is very sparse on detail, and is perhaps intended to serve as an illustration of humanity, only. Placing too much stock in its literal value, rather than its symbolic value, is worthless, Ajantis. Just use such a tale as inspiration for what we can become when facing these fiends.~
@47   = ~Absolutely. Does it not make sense to you that these fiends are an eternal reminder of the greed of man? Or what about the vanity of seeking power? Even the saviours of mankind have their weaknesses, and these tales serve to remind us as such. Keep the faith, Ajantis, and it will keep us from harm.~
@48   = ~Perhaps you are correct in that assertion. But it makes me wonder: why this particular story? Why would it be used as an example, when there are better and more recent ones available? No matter, we shall discuss it on our travels.~
@49   = ~This was my thinking, as well. Its details have either been lost over time or hidden from us, to prevent such a tragedy from happening again. We shall keep watch over each other, my <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>, and be sure that no shadow of evil taints us, as it did them. ~
@50   = ~Are you stating that you seek glory and recognition, or do you seek the absolute eradication of evil?~
@51   = ~What, are you not keeping up with me, Ajantis? I'm looking to be glorified as the saviour of the masses, regardless of what I may do or kill. Have you seen the hero-worship people like Elminster and Khelben get?~
@52   = ~The complete destruction of evil, in whatever form it takes, Ajantis. My fate, your fate, perhaps the fate of all of us here is irrelevant, so long as the goal is achieved.~
@53   = ~I see... A paladin you might be in appearance, but not in spirit. Scorn the virtues of our holy forebears at your own peril, <CHARNAME>. I do not see a clear path for you.~
@54   = ~Then in this we shall end our discussion. But know that we share similar goals, and I look forward to fighting alongside you.~
@55   = ~Have you ever studied the advanced techniques of siege warfare? This city's walls look like it has seen its fair share of encounters with a trebuchet or a siege ram. Despite that, the place still looks marvelous.~
@56   = ~I've been a student of Candlekeep all my infant life, Ajantis. I have a fine appreciation of old, grey architecture and damp-ridden walls. Where this fascination in walls and tiles come from is of no concern to me, and not one I particularly care to share at the moment.~
@57   = ~It's a place of refined beauty, I'll give you that, but siege technology is somewhat beyond me. I can't see how you've reached that conclusion.~
@58   = ~Our quest focuses on discovering the scourge of the Sword Coast, and you're harping on about er... tiling patterns? What's next? Rugs? Are you aware of the urgency of our task?~
@59   = ~You surprise me, <CHARNAME>, in that you show signs of being interested in cultures beyond your own experience, yet when the moment presents itself, you reject it utterly. Have you ever considered that part of being a leader is being able to distinguish between the most appropriate times to lead and to listen?~
@60   = ~And where have you learned about leadership, Ajantis? From the hallowed halls of The Order? From an ancient prelate or some other decayed entity that no longer has any relevance to current affairs? Adventuring isn't as pretty as you may have read. We have to be a strong, fast, effective unit in order to survive. If that calls for the culling of intra-party niceties... Well, you get my point.~
@61   = ~You... may have a point there, Ajantis. Perhaps I should apologize for my attitude. I've not long been out of Candlekeep, and I am still adjusting to the loss of Gorion. Anyway, what were you saying about siege warfare?~
@62   = ~Well, there are several things that give it away. First of all, there are the gradient textures in some of these buildings here. As you can tell the age of trees by their internal rings, you can ascertain the age of the building from its masonry. You see, natural resources, such as granite and other hard rock, are eventually used up, meaning that natural sandpits are turned to as a filler material. When this is applied, you see eventual shifts in the color of external masonry.~
@63   = ~That's all well and great, but all that tells us is that there has been some building degradation. It doesn't tell us that siege engines actually caused the damage. Can you offer anything else to support this claim?~
@64   = ~Your attitude isn't what I would have come to expect from a leader, <CHARNAME>. The urgency of the tasks we have to achieve isn't lost upon us, but I would have expected some integration amongst your fellows. Perhaps next time I shall try military history with you.~
@65   = ~Well, err... that's a rather good observation. See, it has to do with the placing of err... will you excuse me for a moment, we'll catch up on this later... *Ajantis starts polishing his helmet, attempting to look distracted.* ~
@66   = ~Come, <CHARNAME>, let me show you something. *Ajantis places his shield on the ground and shows you the emblem of a striking green wyvern against a golden background.* This is the family crest of the Ilvastarr family. What do you think?~
@67   = ~Is that supposed to represent ferocity, Ajantis, or wisdom, perhaps? It's an interesting symbol, and one that manifests your hidden qualities. Is there a story behind it?~
@68   = ~A family crest suggests family longevity and pride, Ajantis. It also hints at tradition. You should respect this: not everyone has a lineage in which they can show pride and honor. I should know, as I'm one of them.~
@69   = ~Having seen how timid and fragile you are, Ajantis, a rabbit would've been more befitting.~
@70   = ~Mmgh... Sturdy shield. Colorful blazon. Very nice. Let's get moving now.~
@71   = ~There is, but it's not a very glamorous one. Rather than being inspired by a heroic battle or a tragic love story, it is simply an emblem, based on a mosaic by my great-grandfather. He refused to tread the warrior's path, choosing instead to be an artist. His legacy was the wish for his family not to become conceited and arrogant of their own achievements.~
@72   = ~The green dragon represents the arrogance of men, the streak of jealousy that can run through us all, if you will. The golden background represents the riches of the spirit that are open to us all, the opportunities to achieve more without becoming more conceited. This is what all members of the family wear, in honor of both the man and his vision.~
@73   = ~Whilst that isn't as glamorous as you may wish it to be, it is much more insightful of the pitfalls that one such as yourself will have to face, Ajantis. I have every confidence that not only will you be a great paladin, you'll be a humble one.~
@74   = ~Ideologically, that is sound, but realistically it's pathetic. How can you achieve your goals with a family background that chooses paintbrushes over weapons, or humility over glory? Where is the passion to move beyond what your family has imposed on you?~
@75   = ~Yes, the family pride emanates from all of us, although perhaps not as strongly in me, due to my choice in serving Helm. My path is that of order and humility. This crest helps me to remember that. However, I thought you were raised in Candlekeep? Surely, someone from such a prestigious background is part of a long family chain of learned scholars?~
@76   = ~No, I'm not so fortunate as to know the origins of my family. I was raised by Gorion of Candlekeep, but I am not his natural child. My past is as unclear as my future. Still, there is no need for us to sit here and reiterate my own tragic tale, especially when it is so recent. Come, let's move along.~
@77   = ~Aye, you are right, but our sires birth children. It's up to us to grow into men and women.~
@78   = ~Besides, the story of the Ilvastarr crest is not a very glamorous one. Rather than being inspired by a heroic battle or tragic love story, it is simply an emblem, based on a mosaic by my great-grandfather. He refused to tread the warrior's path, choosing instead to be an artist. His legacy was the wish for his family not to become conceited and arrogant about their own achievements.~
@79   = ~Ideologically, that is sound, but realistically it's pathetic. How can you achieve your goals with a family background that chooses paintbrushes over weapons or humility over glory? Where is the passion to move beyond what your family has imposed on you?~
@80   = ~Scoff at my demeanor if you wish, but this emblem serves to remind me of the arrogance of my peers, arrogance similar to yours, in fact. Have you any symbolic possession that does the same for you?~
@81   = ~No, I don't, and they aren't needed. The remains of the only family I ever knew are now lying in an open field, and my bestest friend is straggling along with us now. Why would I need a man-made symbol to remind me of anything? I have all the reminders I need - weakness will get you killed.~
@82   = ~No, I don't, and they aren't needed. The remains of the only family I ever knew are now lying in an open field. My only childhood friend is draped along the arm of some two-bit warrior somewhere. Why do I need to remember such weakness, when I'm trying to distance myself from it?~
@83   = ~No, I've not, and neither do I need it. Whilst the time I spent at Candlekeep was important to me, it is also important that I move on with my life. Cooped up in those walls, I learned nothing of the outside world, beyond the uttered words of old merchants and the mumbled phrases of scholars. I am where I need to be, Ajantis, and no reminder of my childhood will change that.~
@84   = ~I... thank you for your compliment, and hope that I can justify your faith in me. Ours is a long path, and I doubt it will take long for an opportune moment to present itself. Then, we shall measure my progress in both the arts of swordplay and the art of humility.~
@85   = ~Which limits are you referring to, <CHARNAME>? The ability to look at how my ancestors handled themselves, both on and off the field, serves as nothing but an inspiration. Perhaps your comments are born of ignorance, or perhaps jealousy. It matters not, however, we should be heading off.~
@86   = ~How I feel sorry for you. You were privileged in so many ways, having had access to both minds and materials that the rest of civilization could only dream of, only to become what you are. What a power of righteousness you could have been. I shall watch you closely from henceforth.~
@87   = ~Whilst I am somewhat sorry to hear you say that, I do understand. There were many times during my own adolescence that I wished for a change in scenery. I longed for new places to explore, other than the same small, confined space of home. How many times did I look at the grey, overcast skies and wish that I were elsewhere? Too many to recall, I must say. Mind, we cannot sit here all day, reminiscing of last dreams and adventures yet to come. We should head off.~
@88   = ~Here they stand, the dirty bastions of civilization! GRRR! Hurry, <CHARNAME>, I cannot listen to the moans of the Great Mother as the criminal miners rip open her loins, spilling her unborn and her innards for much longer, without losing my mind!~
@89   = ~Excuse me, Faldorn... I feel sick. Can... can you be less descriptive in the future?~
@90   = ~All I can hear is the wind...~
@91   = ~Erm... we *were* moving at a good pace, and we *only* stopped, so we could listen to your small speech.~
@92   = ~Step it up, people! Onward, to punish the heretics!~
@93   = ~Yeah, yeah... Well, ye can marvel in punishing miners. I'll pick up the loot. But we both will enjoy the slaughter part, methinks.~
@94   = ~Faldorn, I have no problem with mining in general, but my goal is to investigate the Iron Throne. Since you seemed a valuable ally and wanted to do... something similar... I agreed to this alliance. Try not to disgust me with your blind hatreds, since I am still in charge here, and will leave you on your own whenever it pleases me.~
@95   = ~If you cannot stomach my words, how are you going to aid me in cutting asunder my enemies?~
@96   = ~Well, you'd laugh, but unleashing havoc and destruction is way easier on my stomach than hearing out your... speeches.~
@97   = ~You are right. I should have toughened up after killing so many...~
@98   = ~I can stomach your words, but I cannot stomach your intentions. While I understand your outrage with the offenses caused to the Nature- ~
@99   = ~Silence, townling! If you do not wish to hearken, LOOK!~
@100  = ~I am strong, but I needed to relieve my heart of the horror that flooded it. *Look*!~
@101  = ~Look at these piles of gore seeping with acidic fluids! They were earth's own liver and stomach, before they were broken! The Great Mother made ore the color of bleeding flesh for a reason... And the torturers will never stop! They will grind her whole body into a stinking mess without pity. They will burn her green children, only to produce cruel steel to continue killing!~
@102  = ~In a way, it feels like poetic justice that the buyer of an iron sword most often dies on the iron sword. Maybe... maybe there is balance to it?~
@103  = ~You have convinced me! Let us attack!~
@104  = ~Yeah, it's an ugly sight. But one needs iron, you know. ~
@105  = ~Grrr! Today we fight for Silvanus and for the Great Mother! My pack, may your strength never fail you!~
@106  = ~Grrr! Dare you think about the loot when the Great Mother is abused! *Look*!~
@107  = ~Open your eyes, townling, and open them wide, before I cut your veins to see if it is blood that flows through you, or dwarven piss! *Look*!~
@108  = ~That's because the stupid monks tried to reign in and twist your natural beastly rage with their false teachings! I will show you the right way for a <PRO_RACE> to live, but now we have no time left! Let us go!~
@109  = ~Balance can never be achieved by destruction alone, you dolt. Now, quit bandying words and attack the mines!~
@110  = ~Arguing with you is like rolling a boulder up to the top of the mountain: useless and can well kill you for all your efforts. Let us just go.~
@111  = ~You are right, of course.~
@112  = ~*roll your eyes* Whatever you say...~
@113  = ~I have no desire to listen to the lies you spout, druid. ~
@114  = ~You are *that* stupid, eh? Or did the monks twist you into Nature's Enemy? I thought you had the right instincts... ~
@115  = ~I do indeed! *shake your head* Stupid misconceptions! We shall charge Nature's offenders! NOW!~
@116  = ~Grrr! Then do not listen! But do not be standing here like an oak tree, only much skinnier, uglier and absolutely useless. Let us do what the Great Mother wants us to do, and flap our tongues later!~
@117  = ~*approvingly* There is a beast hidden in you, <CHARNAME>, but which one?~
@118  = ~Then you are blind, druid. <PRO_RACE> is what I am, and I daresay it is quite plain.~
@119  = ~Phew, beast! I am no beast, Faldorn.~
@120  = ~Beast? I think I'd rather be a plant... Sitting there all day, thinking quietly, with nobody but wind to bother you... *sigh wistfully* Wonderful life!~
@121  = ~Hmm... now that I think about it, it must be a wolf.~
@122  = ~Har-har... I'd help ya to figure that out! ‘Tis a bear!~
@123  = ~I have heard myself compared to a fox before... when they thought I was out of the earshot...~
@124  = ~That must *surely* be a sign of a *true* druid, to see a beastly feat in everyone. 'Tis a pity you were not blessed with such a talent.~
@125  = ~Grrreat! Of course! <PRO_RACE>s are beasts like any other! Grrreat answer!~
@126  = ~What! You think of beasts as lesser? Fool <PRO_RACE>! Oh! I HAVE it! You are simply a <PRO_RACE>! <PRO_RACE>s are beasts like any other, so there is no point to look for another beast similar to you in <PRO_HISHER> mannerism.~
@127  = ~Yes, yes, that's true. *Faldorn's face darkens.* Unless, of course, farrrrrmers come with their plows and gluttonous herds, or evil woodcutters mark you as their victim. ~
@128  = ~All things must die. Is it really much better dying from a disease, or hit by an arrow, than in a cow's mouth, or in the fires of a furnace?~
@129  = ~Then I am glad that I am a <PRO_RACE>, and can defend myself!~
@130  = ~Hmmm... now that I think about it, I'd rather be a wolf.~
@131  = ~Har-har... A bear, then! Bears are big...~
@132  = ~Well... if it has to be a beast... I have heard myself compared to a fox before... when they thought I was out of the earshot...~
@133  = ~Wolves! Now I know why I feel akin to you. I have a blood brother, a he-wolf. The smartest and wariest beast, a stealthy stalker and a dangerous foe. We can run as a pack one day, if you wish.~
@134  = ~We will hunt together, blood sister, when I take on my animal form.~
@135  = ~That might be an interesting experience... perhaps, we'd even howl at the full moon together.~
@136  = ~Nay, Faldorn, I would not want to do that.~
@137  = ~Erm... I will think about it, alright?~
@138  = ~A <PRO_HESHE>-bear is good to have in a party. Great size and great strength, deceptively bulky, but often quicker than a smaller beast. GRRR! I am glad we hunt together, <BROTHERSISTER> bear!~
@139  = ~*looks at you attentively* Yes, yes, those who did call you that had a good eye, if poor brain, to gossip about you so carelessly.~
@140  = ~Grrr! YOU! YOU! *pauses for a second* I know. You are a mocking bird!~
@141  = ~Right. Now that you have resolved this highly important issue, can we please move onto something mundane, such as our current quest?~
@142  = ~*sigh and roll your eyes* Very well. Can we move, already?~
@143  = ~*sarcastically* How *very* fascinating!~
@144  = ~Faldorn, I am not some stupid beast, *Or* bird!~
@145  = ~Wooouh-ouuugh-ooooooooo!!!~
@146  = ~You do not know what you are missing!~
@147  = ~*nods to herself* Yes... a mocking bird.~
@148  = ~I was luckier than you in my fostering. It must feel terrible, discovering how many lies you were taught by *civilized* monks.~
@149  = ~Are you an orphan, too, Faldorn? ~
@150  = ~Uhm... you grew up in a druid's grove or something like that, right? ~
@151  = ~Gorion was the *best* parent a child could wish for. And he never lied to me... unless you count not telling the truth as lying... ~
@152  = ~Of course. But now I can think for myself, finally!~
@153  = ~BAH! I am bloody *happy* that I am not some barbarian, given away as an offering! ~
@154  = ~Nobody is an orphan! The Great Mother cares for all of her children. As for the woman who birthed me, I do not know. The tribe offered me to the druids, when I was a newborn. ~
@155  = ~But why?~
@156  = ~How touching. Now let us go, Faldorn.~
@157  = ~You should tell this story more often. Maybe it will compel people to take better care of their kids, once they know how you came to grow into such a... druid.~
@158  = ~Yes, yes, I remember the story now.~
@159  = ~I pity all the children who are forced by their heretical parents to live in the cities. GRRR! It's just like caging cubs!~
@160  = ~Of course he lied! Otherwise you wouldn't be looking so wistfully at the houses and city walls. Besides, all townlings are liars, and their words are just as murky and twisted as the streets of their cities. GRRR! Only those who live in the wilds speak their mind openly!~
@161  = ~Ah! You are not as hopeless as the rest of the townlings. I feel good about us hunting together.~
@162  = ~Har! You are a typical townling, then, seeing everything in a perverted way. See, you always had this stigma of ‘base-born', ‘nameless', ‘kinless' or ‘some whore's get' attached to you. While I ran freely, knowing well that the Great Mother welcomes me, no matter who sired me.~
@163  = ~My tribe's land was hit by drought and frost for a few years. The prey became scarce, and the streams went dry. Tempus, Auril and spirits of the ancestors did not listen to my people's pleas. Then the tribe elders decided to give a newborn as an offering to the druids. ~
@164  = ~But why *you*? Where you a shaman's daughter or something? ~
@165  = ~*shake your head* Barbarians. Did it help with the rains?~
@166  = ~I see. Well, we have to move now.~
@167  = ~Maybe. Or maybe I was the only one born that winter? Maybe my mother died in a childbed, or she was heavy with me when a stronger man killed her previous husband and took her to be his wife, and didn't want another's cub? I know not, and it's not important.~
@168  = ~Yes. Silvanus was pleased that the Black Raven brought a vessel for the spirit of Kador the Burner, the famous druid who fell to the Nature's enemies and sent rains. Kador's spirit now lives in me... I just know it!~
@169  = ~Simian... yes, I do mean *you*, little <PRO_MANWOMAN>, whose main goal seems to be wandering aimlessly through barbaric lands. Do you even realize what kind of luck you had in meeting me and having me join your... shall we name it ‘company'? Do you even suspect what gem you have inadvertently discovered? (No, of course not; <PRO_HESHE> is so thick that <PRO_HESHE> is clueless that <PRO_HESHE> has a Red Wizard of Thay in <PRO_HISHER> employ.)~
@170  = ~A very red jewel?~
@171  = ~Oh, quit your whining. I am at least as good a mage as you are, if not a better one.~
@172  = ~Wizard, you study every night for hours to make your poor head keep what my blood gives me freely. I think it's you who should be in awe of me, not vice versa.~
@173  = ~Well, enlighten me, then. It is a sore thing not to know just how lucky I am.~
@174  = ~As far as I am concerned, you are yet another clown who leeched himself to my glorious self, to snatch himself a sliver of fame from my plate, and to get crumbs from my spoils.~
@175  = ~A Red Wizard of Thay wears his robes with pride, and expects deference from those who are graced with their sight... This would occur in civilized lands, of course.~
@176  = ~So, what's so special about the Red Wizards, Edwin? It is a sore thing not to know just how lucky I am. ~
@177  = ~*snicker* That explains why a Red Wizard would dress up like a desperate picador, but what about you, Edwin?~
@178  = ~In our uncivilized lands, *we* barbarians would rather laugh than bow to such as you.~
@179  = ~The Red Wizards of Thay hold the darkest secrets of the strongest magic! The weakest of our Zulkir could grind that pathetic Elminster of yours to dust with a flick of her finger. (I hold more power in my pinky than <PRO_HESHE> does in <PRO_HISHER> dry little brain, I am sure.)~
@180  = ~And Zulkir would be a honey and nut pastry?~
@181  = ~Oh, bite it, Edwin. Red Wizards think themselves so important, but in truth, they are no better than other mages. In fact, they are worse, because they spend too much time on political scheming, and too little on researching magic.~
@182  = ~You have convinced me of the Red Wizards' superiority, Edwin. If you shall offer me a practical demonstration of your skill in the next battle, I'll kneel before you and forever worship your prowess. I'm sure you wish to hurry that joyous occurrence along, so let's just move. *Now*!~
@183  = ~Indeed, in a land that prefers hard boiled eggs to meringue a la crème, your artless approach to magic would be more appreciated than my perfectly honed skill. Luckily, there are more enlightened societies out there. ~
@184  = ~I will have you know, simian, that you have a Red Wizard of Thay gracing you with his presence. I have been groomed to rule. The only thing that stops me from seeking to conquer this wasteland is that it is utterly barbaric and unappealing to a sophisticated thinker of my caliber.~
@185  = ~Ah, well. I would not mind ruling Baldur's Gate myself, but tastes differ.~
@186  = ~Oh, bite it, Edwin. Red Wizards think themselves so important, but in truth, they are no better than other mages. In fact, they are worse, because they spend too much time on political scheming, and too little on researching magic. ~
@187  = ~I see your wit is as sharp and cutting as a boiled potato. (That goes to prove that you don't have to be a druid for wildlife to talk back.)~
@188  = ~I *am* a Red Wizard, you dullard!~
@189  = ~O! Who would have guessed! *you start laughing*~
@190  = ~No kidding?!~
@191  = ~Calm down, Edwin. A practical demonstration of your outstanding skill in the next battle is in order. And we won't get there unless we move. *Now*!~
@192  = ~The Zulkir, my painfully ignorant travel companion, are the most powerful mages among the Red Wizards. They have complete dominion over the wizards in their respective schools of magic. (Shall I have to clarify *that*, I wonder?)~
@193  = ~Magocracy does not sound like a very good way of governing to me... True mages should be removed from the affairs of the world to practice true arcane art.~
@194  = ~Oh, bite it, Edwin. Red Wizards think themselves so important, but in truth, they are no better than other mages. In fact, they are worse, because they spend too much time on political scheming, and too little on researching magic. ~
@195  = ~You have convinced me of the Red Wizards' superiority, Edwin. If you shall offer me a practical demonstration of your skill in the next battle, I'll kneel before you and forever worship your prowess. I'm sure you wish to hurry that joyous occurrence along, so let's just move. *Now*!~
@196  = ~Yes, yes, the challenges posed by the unilateral mind. Those who are accepted into the ranks of the Red Wizards are talented beyond what barbarians here can imagine. Thusly, they excel in both magic and politics.~
@197  = ~True mages should not be removed from the world, they should rule it. Keeping wizards from leadership would leave the world stumbling in the dark, like a headless chicken.~
@198  = ~<CHARNAME>, what part of "I command you to kill the Rashemi witch" did you not understand? Mayhaps I should put it in simpler, shorter words? Would you need it to be written down and read to you aloud five times a day, so you could keep it in your tiny mind?~
@199  = ~Why do you even need to kill her? Is she a person of some importance?~
@200  = ~Hmm... that reading out loud idea is not that bad. I love the sound of your voice almost as much as you do yourself, Edwin.~
@201  = ~I promised you to kill her, and I will make good on my word.~
@202  = ~*sigh* <CHARNAME> do this, <CHARNAME> do that... somebody, give this monkey a banana!~
@203  = ~Mayhaps I should cut your throat and see if your blood is red, like your skirt.~
@204  = ~What part of, "I am tired of hearing your voice" did you not understand?~
@205  = ~Oh, I understood every word you said... I was just ignoring you.~
@206  = ~She is a Rashemi witch, and it is my appointed task to destroy her. That is all you need to know. (And all <PRO_HESHE> can comprehend, anyway. What would a simian know of the prospects that will open before me if I gain Nevron's trust?)~
@207  = ~She is a Rashemi witch, and it is my appointed task to destroy her. Let us say that her demise shall be the first step of my glorious ascent.~
@208  = ~Ah, yes, indeed – the sound of my voice. I shall have you know that many before you have found it alluring, especially in the hour of sunset. Yet I feel obliged to remind you that my fabulous voice is not going to be there for you to enjoy, if the witch lives.~
@209  = ~Is she a person of some importance?~
@210  = ~Were you and she... er... connected in any way before, that you so greatly desired her death, my precious?~
@211  = ~*rolls his eyes* (Not *another* barbarian lusting after my perfect self...) Listen, oh woman of er... integrity. My fabulous voice is not going to be there for you to marvel at, if you won't kill my adversary.~
@212  = ~Do you even need to kill her? Is she a person of some importance?~
@213  = ~In your own grim and shabby way you have quite a... commanding presence. If one closes his eyes to your unwashed face, dreadful accent and beggar's attire, that is. Now, off you go, simian.~
@214  = ~You have a charming and commanding presence. I foresee that our collaboration shall be pleasurable in more ways than one. ~
@215  = ~(It is amusing how they always imitate their betters.) Kill *Dynaheir*! Not a goblin, not a xvart, not a kobold – *Dynaheir*! D-Y-N-A... Just kill her, and then we will talk fruits!~
@216  = ~What are you suggesting, you insipid... (Wait! That might just be the stimulus that the simian will respond to!) Dynaheir was the love of my life, <CHARNAME>. And she betrayed me... horribly. (That's enough details for this stupid cow, I think.) Kill her, and I will let you drool over me in adoring gratitude. I might even kiss you. Later. Much later.~
@217  = ~How about – a kiss now, murder later?~
@218  = ~How did she betray you, Edwin?~
@219  = ~I promised you to kill her, and I will make good on my word. We will discuss romantic implications some other time.~
@220  = ~Huh, good try... But not believable. Care to try again?~
@221  = ~No, simian, that won't do at all. I have standards, and you will meet them after you have done what I ordered you to do. (If she can follow commands, it might not be a total loss.)~
@222  = ~I said: horribly. Now kindly pick your jaw up from the ground and attend to my task and your... (How should I name it? Cross-country hide and seek?) ah well, quests.~
@223  = ~Of course not – my perfect taste in women would prevent me from ever becoming involved with such a fanatical, primitive and plain-minded wench.~
@224  = ~Of course not – my perfect taste in women would prevent me from such a mistake.~
@225  = ~This land is infested with mercy which, in time, causes such complications as feeblemindness. You are a sick, very sick <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>, and it is I who suffers from your symptoms. Can your brain grasp the fact that I did not come here to *save* the witch and to travel in her abhorring company, but to kill her?~
@226  = ~Edwin, I do not care for Dynaheir, but I want to have Minsc along.~
@227  = ~Oh, shut up. She is useful.~
@228  = ~Indeed, you have blotched your task, so I can report you to your Zulkir as a traitor. Now, I suggest that you do what I say.~
@229  = ~Truth be told, Edwin, I don't really want to kill Dynaheir.~
@230  = ~Well, let us kill her, then!~
@231  = ~I shall not suffer such indignity as the murder of a comrade at arms. Dynaheir is under my protection, Edwin, and you'd better not forget it.~
@232  = ~You keep the witch because of that critter-worshipping oaf? ~
@233  = ~(Precisely what I would expect from an orphan begotten in a haystack.) You need not lose him, <CHARNAME>... if I were to arrange an... accident...~
@234  = ~Right you are, Edwin. He is strong, but he is stupid. Go ahead with your plan.~
@235  = ~No, I do not like this conspiracy. Let's just kill Dynaheir, and be done with that. ~
@236  = ~Oh, shut up. She has her uses.~
@237  = ~Why exactly do you need to inform me? Have my leadership skills impressed you to such an extent that you seek my approval?~
@238  = ~I cannot call her a mediocrity, <CHARNAME>, for it would be an exaggeration of her capabilities. Your... party (yes, yes, that's a more flattering word than a rag-tag band) will be much better off if you replace her.~
@239  = ~And if you are... afraid of the resistance she can put up... I can arrange an... accident...~
@240  = ~Right you are, Edwin. Go ahead with your plan.~
@241  = ~Dynaheir lives, Edwin. Or should I report to your Zulkir that you have failed your task and are willingly consorting with a Rashemi witch?~
@242  = ~My amateur comedian companion, your words would mean less to my Zulkir than the rattle of a pebble caught in the sole of his boot. I suggest that you do not try to play this game with me, <CHARNAME>. It would be too boring to win over you.~
@243  = ~That will be done in due course.~
@244  = ~Oh, you do not want to kill the witch - that's bloody brilliant! Your sense of humor is growing on me, I swear! (I do hope she is joking...)~
@245  = ~It is not a jest. I do find her useful, and besides, I fear for your safety.~
@246  = ~Yes, I'm a funny one. Let's kill her, then.~
@247  = ~Truly, Edwin, to me, murder lacks that subtle je ne sais quoi. It hardly seems like a feat to do away with the witch, before you know what she's after. Besides, she seems well guarded, and I fear for your safety.~
@248  = ~Truly, Edwin, to me, murder lacks that subtle je ne sais quoi. It hardly seems like a feat to do away with the witch, before you know what she's after. Besides, she seems skilled in her craft, and I fear for your safety.~
@249  = ~You could do this without constantly pestering me about it, you know. It's not like you lack the opportunity, seeing as you're travelling by her side.~
@250  = ~It is a matter of basic courtesy, given that you have convinced yourself and these other simpletons that you are the leader of this group. I shall not waste time on consulting you on this issue. (Good. It is good.)~
@251  = ~I was under the impression that we had an understanding, regarding the witch. I hope that you haven't lost your stomach for a little conspiracy – it is, after all, the spice of life, and you do seem like one who appreciates a touch of perversion.~
@252  = ~Truly, Edwin, it hardly seems like a feat to do away with the witch, before you know what she's after. Besides, she seems well guarded, and I fear for your safety.~
@253  = ~Truly, Edwin, it hardly seems like a feat to do away with the witch, before you know what she's after. Besides, she seems skilled in her craft, and I fear for your safety.~
@254  = ~But she doesn't even mind having you around! Dynaheir didn't actually do anything to you! I mean, if you did attack her, she might...~
@255  = ~I shall not suffer such indignity as the murder of a comrade at arms. Dynaheir is under my protection, Edwin, and you'd better not forget it.~
@256  = ~What an utterly charming (if obviously dim witted) disposition you have, my dear... Let me set your mind at ease – I am perfectly capable of doing away with the witch. Yet, to demonstrate that I am not without respect towards a woman's delicate sensibilities, I shall not consult you again on such prosaic subjects. (I see that my plans for the Wychlaran will encounter no opposition from her.)~
@257  = ~It's been a pleasure to confer with you, nonetheless. (I see that my plans for the Wychlaran will encounter no opposition from her.)~
@258  = ~Let me set your mind at ease – I am perfectly capable of doing away with the witch. However, your concern for my well being is unexpectedly touching, and gaining more insight into the Wychlaran's plans might actually prove beneficial.~
@259  = ~Very well, my dear, you have proven a point. She will be dealt with in due course.~
@260  = ~This feeblemindedness has affected you more than I had originally thought. Perhaps you have tiny illithid dwelling inside your rapidly shrinking skull. If I could actually bring myself to care, I would feel sorry for you. As it is, though, I just hope it is not contagious.~
@261  = ~Ah, how I miss the graceful and sophisticated women of my homeland... It looks like women *here* are simply keen on pretending they are manly men. Others provide conversation as fascinating as the rumbling of a boulder... Not to mention the ones who think mimicking the mating rituals of wild ducks is attractive. (One could go mad from all that quacking, wing flapping and tail wiggling.)~
@262  = ~*snort* The observation would have nothing to do with the quarrel you had with your one-night lady friend back there, of course.~
@263  = ~*hotly* Why do you always have to berate others? Have you ever considered that women here do not care for you, because you look and act ridiculous?~
@264  = ~*shrug* Say what you will, but they are good enough for me.~
@265  = ~Is that so? What type would you prefer, then? Birds of paradise, mother hens, silly geese...~
@266  = ~Please, please, give me a moment's respite from your whining!~
@267  = ~I assure you that my observation has a purely philosophical value. It has nothing to do with the self-interested lowly wench. Yet, all theories need practical application - I suppose she could serve as an example of the outrageous attitudes here.~
@268  = ~What happened? I thought you were quite popular amidst the barmaids and free-spirited ladies of the region. ~
@269  = ~No! Of course not – it is just that the women from these parts are so used to oafs that they would not recognize perfection if it bit them on the... erm, nose. ~
@270  = ~Now, of course, the indiscriminative voracity of your barbarian taste would push you to copulate with a slug, if a local intellectual pointed you to it and told you it was female. I, on another hand, require stimulating conversation, bodily hygiene and some distant trace of good manners in a woman that is deserving of my attention.~
@271  = ~An inconsequential and trivial matter, I assure you.~
@272  = ~Has Edwin turned discrete all of a sudden? Where are all the spicy details?~
@273  = ~Oh, thank you for not sharing it, then. Gods forbid I should ever hear something trivial or inconsequential from you.~
@274  = ~For once, I'd like to hear something constructive from you. Since I now know what kind of women you find repulsive, do enlighten me on what kind – if any – you actually like.~
@275  = ~*pauses and smirks* Would you like an honest response, or the pompous line I serve debutantes at the Spring Solstice ball? It is quite charming and well conceived, as befitting a man who is as versed in the ways of the world as I am. However, you do seem to be past the age when young women believe that denying men sensual favors will result in death or permanent debilitating affliction. Or that they would do anything to win your favour.~
@276  = ~Who knows?~
@277  = ~What a horrible and demeaning thing to say!~
@278  = ~The honest answer will do, I should think...~
@279  = ~That only proves your own stupidity. Sages would be grateful for a single word from me.~
@280  = ~Not so (quoth I), let baser things devise
To die in dust, but you shall live by fame:
My verse your virtues rare shall eternize,
And in the heavens write your glorious name;
Where, whenas death shall all the world subdue,
Our love shall live, and later life renew.~
@281  = ~It is only demeaning for those who would actually buy such nonsense. To others, it is simply amusing; I see it is not the case with you. (A sense of humor does require intelligence. What *was* I thinking?)~
@282  = ~One option would be a woman, whose perfect beauty is unmarred by any trace of intelligence. Of course, she should be, at least, bright enough to see that being overly communicative spoils her charm – after all, a marble statue might be beautiful to behold, but one wouldn't really expect it to speak wise words.~
@283  = ~I should have expected that...~
@284  = ~That's so typical of you! When will you learn women are not inanimate objects?~
@285  = ~It's surprising that you even like another type of woman.~
@286  = ~Obviously, you do not understand the complexity of my personality. You might have mistaken me for a shallow man – let me assure you, shallow I am not. (Constantly being misunderstood makes me taste bile.)~
@287  = ~Even ladies who were less endowed by nature can catch my eye and benefit from my unparalleled talents, provided they challenge my intellect, rather than cause the blood to rush away from my head at first glance.~
@288  = ~Excuse me while I regain my ability to speak.~
@289  = ~I am sure all the less fortunate women are grateful for your immense generosity.~
@290  = ~I can't decide whether I should be flattered or offended that you are still capable of coherent speech in my company.~
@291  = ~Inanimate? No. (Do I stutter as I speak, I wonder?) Animate, and quite beautifully so. If anything from this conversation should, by some miracle, attach itself to your memory, let it be the fact that being overly communicative is a sin.~
@292  = ~So thou hast shown thy true colors at last! And they art red. Let us battle then!~
@293  = ~Damnation! I've broken one of my vials...~
@294  = ~Oh, I'm sorry.~
@295  = ~Oh... what was it for?~
@296  = ~That's fantastic. I can smell the contents from here. Get rid of it.~
@297  = ~Yes, well I can get another very easily...~
@298  = ~Uh-huh. Not easily enough to cover that stench. Dump it!~
@299  = ~Oh, well, I use them to collect... specimens... ~
@300  = ~Specimens? What do you mean by that? ~
@301  = ~You mean, all that blood and goop you collect? Disgusting! Keep it away from me!~
@302  = ~Certainly. I am no more insensible than you to the fact that this sample is spoilt beyond recovery. I *would* have expected a more comradely sympathy for my plight, however. You really are very crass and insensitive, you know.~
@303  = ~Well, you've seen me gather the hearts' blood of several creatures, no? I use these collectibles in my experiments. I don't understand why, but almost everyone seems to have some little distaste for my efforts. ~
@304  = ~Actually, no. It sounds very interesting to me. ~
@305  = ~You're a sick, insane Necromancer, and I wonder *why* I allow you and your revolting collection anywhere near me! ~
@306  = ~Uh... it might be that your preoccupation with death and decay strikes people as a little... odd. ~
@307  = ~*Really*? I... I don't meet many girls who like my sort of hobbies. ~
@308  = ~Maybe you could show me sometime? What you do with your... specimens? ~
@309  = ~Yeah, well I'm pretty open-mined. Just don't make me into a specimen, ok? ~
@310  = ~Ok, I'm done playing along with this one. You're freaking me out, and the smell is making me sick. Just get rid of it. In silence! ~
@311  = ~Of course! I can't deny such pleasures to one so willing!~
@312  = ~Oh, well, that's a little disappointing, <CHARNAME>. But only a little bit. You really would make a *magnificent* subject...~
@313  = ~Only *living* people. But consider; the dead must outnumber the living by ten thousand to one by now. So who are we - the living - the temporarily living, I mean - to be so prejudiced against true democracy?~
@314  = ~Right, right, right. Just dump the stink and fall back in line. ~
@315  = ~Could be just a practical thing. The dead aren't much in evidence. They don't have a lot to say for themselves, you know. ~
@316  = ~Hmm. You may have a point there. Maybe you can give me a little instruction the next chance you get. ~
@317  = ~Ahhh, but they *can*! You will be astounded - I hope, one day soon - to discover the eloquence of the deceased, <CHARNAME>. ~
@318  = ~Ah, look at this corpse, <CHARNAME>.~
@319  = ~Note that the intestines are lower in relative mass, as is typical for a canid, as opposed to the omnivorous demands on the human digestive tract, but that they are located suitably for a biped rather than a quadruped.~
@320  = ~Urrrppp!~
@321  = ~No, look! This is the *interesting* part. The unused torso space is occupied by an enlarged heart and lungs. Hence the creature's unnatural endurance. The additional power of the heart's pumping action would also account for its bleeding so *very* copiously when dismembered.~
@322  = ~Perhaps, now, I shall show you what I do with my specimens, yes? ~
@323  = ~I was wondering when you'd show me! ~
@324  = ~Couldn't we wait for something more... interesting? ~
@325  = ~This is more disgusting than I thought - never mind! ~
@326  = ~First, I cut open its chest - like so. There! Can you see the heart? ~
@327  = ~Yes, it's there, right? ~
@328  = ~No, I can't. Sorry. ~
@329  = ~I... I think I'm going to be sick. ~
@330  = ~Nonsense! Its bestial ferocity is the perfect essence for a beginner's first distillation. Now.~
@331  = ~CHICKEN! Fit only to make a salad of. Or do you lay eggs as well? No matter - this is what I expected.~
@332  = ~Correct! You take to this well. Now hold the vial still, while I extract the blood...~
@333  = ~Why did you cut it there? Does it matter where you do it? ~
@334  = ~That's a lot of blood... ~
@335  = ~Oh - I'm going to be sick! ~
@336  = ~That doesn't matter. In the wolf's case, the spleen would do even better, but you'd never find that. Just stay away from these big puffy things. They are lungs, and of no use to anyone. Unless you find one in a fish, that is... ahem.~
@337  = ~See? Here is the heart. Lovely, isn't it? Now hold this vial, whilst I fill it. ~
@338  = ~Hee-hee! Suppression of the gag reflex is part of the learning process, <CHARNAME>. But not on the specimen, you fool! Over there! ~
@339  = ~Bluh-WOOAHLP! ~
@340  = ~*You keep your rebellious dinner down. There is a reason why the songs call you the Hero of the Sword Coast!*~
@341  = ~Yes, it does. You get the most blood when you cut it along this curve. Hmm. Could really have used a larger bottle. No matter. Your sleeves are washable, I trust?~
@342  = ~Well, that's all of it. That's how you collect the blood. Now to its use. ~
@343  = ~*smile* I'm looking forward to it! ~
@344  = ~Well, maybe... It *does* make me a little nauseous. ~
@345  = ~Yes, quite a lot. Could have used a larger bottle, actually. Never mind that now. I've seen you launder your clothing, and I assume your face and hands are washable as well...~
@346  = ~Anyway... that's how you collect the blood. Next, I'll show you what to do with it. ~
@347  = ~Well, maybe... It *does* make me a little nauseous... ~
@348  = ~*He grins insanely at a point beyond your left ear.* If I dared hope for so much, I'd say you'll *really* enjoy this. ~
@349  = ~Now! See that pretty little flower I preserved? You, <CHARNAME>, shall pour the heart's blood over it, whilst I recite the enabling cantrip:
Oh, gay blossom,
Within you, abide
The spirit of poor wolfman
From the Other Side. ~
@350  = ~That sure was impressive. Now what? ~
@351  = ~Okay. We've now got a blood-soaked flower. What of it? ~
@352  = ~Well, I translated - entirely for your benefit. Couldn't expect you to appreciate Necromantic in five minutes, could I? Anyway... ~
@353  = ~*Now*, <CHARNAME>, you take the flower! ~
@354  = ~Huh! What a let-down. I... OOWWW!!!~
@355  = ~Childishly simple, but... effective, is it not? ~
@356  = ~You bastard! That 'flower' is a dire stinging nettle! ~
@357  = ~Really? I bow to the superiority of your botanical lore. But... what, pray tell, has the type of flower to do with any of this? ~
@358  = ~It's got poisoned thorns, dammit. I'll be itching for a week, if I don't die of blood poisoning first on account of your foolery. ~
@359  = ~That 'poor little flower' bites worse - all by itself - than any wolf I've ever met. ~
@360  = ~Nothing. Nothing at all. You're a wonder wizard of the first degree, Xzar.~
@361  = ~Oooh! Would you do that for me? I'd be ever so grateful, really I would.~
@362  = ~Then behold the power of unintended magecraft, <CHARNAME>, for never have I observed of clearer case of like calling to like - which, as you doubtless will *not* know, is the foundation of *all* thaumaturgy!~
@363  = ~You know, somehow, <CHARNAME>, you say that as if you have expected any other result.~
@364  = ~Really, you astonish me. I've seen you covered from toe to crown in random muck from the accidents of combat. Is it the intelligent purposefulness behind this mere drop that discommodes you? Now if you are *quite* finished amusing yourself, may we continue the lesson? ~
@365  = ~Uh... sure... but... not now. Next year, this time... maybe...~
@366  = ~Phew. *spit* Yeah, I'm ready. ~
@367  = ~*Blech!* Ah... Xzar, dare I ask *why* you are prodding my late lunch there on the ground? ~
@368  = ~I wasn't! Well, not really. Just the off-chance, you know... that you'd coughed up something important. But you don't seem to have done, so if we might continue? ~
@369  = ~Sure. Let ‘er rip. ~
@370  = ~No! Not now, and not ever! Let's move it.~
@371  = ~Montaron, you're staring again! *sigh* Have I smudged my eyeshadow... what I'd give for a mirror...~
@372  = ~Weren't starin'. Were curious, though. Why'd a well-born dolly-bird such as ye be, take t' hangin' wi' a pack o' alley-bashers 'n' cutthroats like we? Seems ye'd have had better choices fer yer 'musement - *and* fer yer dippin'.~
@373  = ~I am not hanging around! I... I am an adventurer at heart, like you and <CHARNAME>. But father... No! He has nothing to do with this! Nothing!~
@374  = ~Heheh! Daddy won't stick yer pastimes, eh? Not ree-spectuble, is they? Heh. I knows *that* tune well enow. Angries the blood, don't it?~
@375  = ~Anger? *sigh* It's... er... just silly things, really. Like how he is always telling me to dress like a lady and not a street urchin, even though *I* should be allowed to dress how I feel! Or... or when he insists on embarrassing me in front of people by telling them "what a beautiful baby" I was! Or..~
@376  = ~(Phew! Looser'n a barrel o' herring 'at's gone ripe inna sun.)~
@377  = ~...me to say the "right words", when he is introducing me to his oafish friends at his silly parties! Not to mention trying to marry me off to every noble boy this side of Waterdeep, *never* letting me have any privacy, and worst of all, not letting me out of the house without *six* armed guards to watch over me! Oh... he just makes me *so* mad!~
@378  = ~Heh! Two's comp'ny 'n' three's none, so six'd be twice as worse, I guess. But yer dad, he musta own a right pack o' them guards; t' hess-court yerself about, yet keep th' homeplace safe, too~
@379  = ~Not too many... only about half the city watch. He's always telling me it's "for your own safety, Skie"... but I can *never* get any time alone, with all those eyes watching me. That's why I used the secret door to get out at night.~
@380  = ~Pfeh! See-krit doors! Tradesman door, ye mean. They 'see-krit doors' is fer kiddies' tales, they is!~
@381  = ~*smile* No, there really is one - politics here in town *may* become rather rough at times. It's along the northern wall just underneath the second hanging basket... Hey, you know what, Monty, you're nice. If a little curious.~
@382  = ~North wall... second bas... Eh? Curious? Well, I ne'er minded learnin' from one what knows 'n' *I* don't know much 'bout yer gent-tree here'bouts, plainly~
@383  = ~As I said; you're a little curious. Don't forget though: *giggles* curiosity killed the cat!~
@384  = ~May have done. Big, fat cats, too, I reckon...~
@385  = ~Hmm... What's this? Hey, Xzar! You dropped something.~
@386  = ~Oh? I don't think so. What is it?~
@387  = ~It's only a tatty notebo... hey... what's this? "That new girl's noble blood should serve adequately - a vial, or maybe three - in case of mishap. When she is asleep, perchance..."~
@388  = ~No, doesn't ring any bells here. Sorry.~
@389  = ~Hey! I *saw* you drop it!~
@390  = ~Nonsense. That would imply that I coveted a vial of your blood. Why would anyone want that? Even yourself? Ah-ha! I have it! Red ink!~
@391  = ~Uh... have you actually managed to *lose* money by adventuring?~
@392  = ~Er... no. I believe... financially... our efforts have been rather successful. Perhaps... the ritual of Barzenak... now, where has that twit of a girl got herself to?~
@393  = ~Er... I'm right here, beside you, Xzar. What's the ritual of Barzenak?~
@394  = ~Oh, that? Silly thing. Barzenak was a tutor of my youth. Kept a household staffed entirely by zombies. The joke, such as it was, required each undead slave to have had at least forty-seven generations of noble ancestry in life. *He* thought that was funny, but... I say! How many generations of nobility have preceded you, young lady?~
@395  = ~Well, let me think. There wa... Hey! Your not thinking about turning me into a zombie, are you?~
@396  = ~No... although it would be a fine joke on old Barzy, if your pedigree were not up to snuff. *sigh* But he's dead himself, now, so he couldn't appreciate it.~
@397  = ~I hope someone made a zombie of *him*.~
@398  = ~Of dear Barzenak? Why ever for? No. He tried to become a lich... didn't quite make it. They stuffed him, as I heard it, and sat him in the hallway of his former home. The new owner claimed his effigy keeps the zombies up to their work.~
@399  = ~Stuf... ugh... that's horrible, Xzar! Why must you be *so* disgusting?~
@400  = ~Well, *pardon* my sugar-coating it for you! If I didn't imagine it all. I could tell you... one way or the other... if I could *just* find that compact little reference volume I used to have.~
@401  = ~My soul aches for my lost Deheriana.~ [%tutu_var%KIVAN11]
@402  = ~Come, brother of the woods, do not be so gloomy! Why not be happy at the beauty of nature? Not to mention all the righteous butt-kicking we get to apply to evil's backside!~
@403  = ~I enjoy it just fine, Minsc. But revenge is the only thing that drives me, the only thing that keeps me alive... To be able, at last, to slay that animal named Tazok, to finally send him screaming to the Abyss...~
@404  = ~Kivan is scary sometimes, isn't he, Boo? Just look at his eyes glowing!~
@405  = ~*squeak*~ [GAM_48]
@406  = ~Ahem... Kivan, Boo says he understands your pain, and that he, too, will have Tazok's eyes, for the friend he murdered.~
@407  = ~Boo has lost someone to that fiend, as well?~
@408  = ~Yes and no. Well, his friend still lives, but he buried himself alive in his own pain, and refuses to come out. Evil should be punished, yes! But righteous heroes shouldn't slowly kill themselves each day with grief... Evil wins that way. After all, we fight evil so we can enjoy goodness, not gloominess, right, Kivan?~
@409  = ~*Kivan claps Minsc on his shoulder and turns away.*~
@410  = ~Please, dost not fault Minsc for his cheery nature. He means no harm.~
@411  = ~I know that, dear lady. I pray that he never changes.~
@412  = ~BOO said that?!~
@413  = ~Ranger's honor!~
@414  = ~Say, Minsc... has... er... has Boo ever been in love?~
@415  = ~Sure! Boo loves Minsc! And Minsc loves Boo! It's a bond that cannot be broken!~
@416  = ~Then imagine that one of you was murdered in the most foul fashion...~
@417  = ~M-M-Minsc without Boo? No! Nooo! Minsc would cry and cry and... oh... Minsc understands... No wonder Kivan is so gloomy... and that he wipes out evil with such... ummm...oh, what's the word... Yes, that's it, Boo... fervor! Well, Minsc and Boo shall help our gloomy friend make mincemeat out of the stinky half-ogre! And then hamsters and rangers everywhere shall rejoice!~
@418  = ~Ah, yes, they shall. And people might even stop accusing me of plotting to preserve Kivan's melancholic demeanor, so that I stay the most attractive man in the party... Wonderful. Now, let us continue on our quest, so Kivan gets his chance to tickle Tazok with his spear... And perhaps the rest of us get to put in a hit or two as well. ~
@419  = ~And everyone shall... ~
@420  = ~Oh, look Boo, clover! Let's go find a lucky one!~
@421  = ~*squeak*~ [GAM_48]
@422  = ~Perhaps you could restrict your killing to the odd victim or two each day, Shar-Teel. The guard in this city is less incompetent than what you would have found in the backwater.~
@423  = ~The day I take advice from you, mage, is the day that you scream for me to release you from the remnants of your piteous life.~
@424  = ~It surprises me that a woman could be so entirely lacking in charm. (Perhaps the gods missed a 'c' when they created her. "And we shall maketh Shar-Teel to be the most harming." Yes, that has the sheen of godly incompetence. Deities!)~
@425  = ~Well, wizard, you've lasted longer than I had thought possible. When we first met, I was sure you would soon end your days as a red smear on the end of someone's sword.~
@426  = ~And what, pray, Shar-Teel, led you to such a high opinion of me? ~
@427  = ~That's the end to which spellcasters frequently come - at least in my experience.~
@428  = ~Putting aside my own illustrious example for a moment, are you deliberately forgetting the existence of the many spellcasters which are virtual powerhouses, who would fireball you - and any opponent - into a little pile of smoking rubble with a mere twitch of their fingers? ~
@429  = ~Well I suppose it's a test of which is faster, their fingers, or my sword.~
@430  = ~I doubt that *you* could outswing a wizard's contingency.~
@431  = ~But I can outswing his head. That's all that's necessary.~
@432  = ~Wizards, even mediocre ones, know a thing or two about strategy. The answer is always to stay well back and let some overbrawny, delightfully clueless simian take the brunt of the blows. Speaking of which-~
@433  = ~How are you today, Minsc?~
@434  = ~Minsc is hale and hearty, though that is of no concern to evil Red Wizards. In fact, Minsc wishes to retract his previous statement.~
@435  = ~And you, Shar-Teel?~
@436  = ~And how are you feeling today, Shar-Teel? (I would ask you what you're thinking, but somehow I doubt you'd be able to answer.)~
@437  = ~I'd be much better off if I wasn't talking to such a spineless weakling. Maybe if you spent more time sharpening our blades, instead of your idle tongue, the rest of us could go an entire day without a headache! But no matter... You'll catch your death soon enough, Edwin, even if you do insist on staying in the back, like a coward. Honestly, I can't see how you have any fun on these adventures.~
@438  = ~Oh, it is quite amusing, I assure you. But now look what you've done. This little exchange is beginning to resemble an actual conversation... and we wouldn't want *that* to happen, now, would we? It might lead others to the false assumption that you are actually worthy of bantering with me, which would be a gross exaggeration of your verbal skills. (And, needless to say, an insult to my own). Scamper off, then, Shar-Teel. Right to the front, if you please.~
@439  = ~I don't see why you bother cleaning your armour, knightling. Each blood stain is a mark of victory.~
@440  = ~In future, address me as 'Ajantis', or do not address me at all.~
@441  = ~As to your question, it is the duty of a knight to keep his equipment in good condition. The Order demands no less.~
@442  = ~How *noble* of you.~
@443  = ~Aye, 'tis noble. And less taxing on the nose, as well.~
@444  = ~Ah, this is what I was born for! To travel the path of glory and valor! Destiny speaks, and the world is bright-lit this day!~
@445  = ~And that is all you want? To travel on the path of glory and valor? Pfaugh! Your life is so bland, I'd almost feel sorry for you, if I wasn't feeling a stronger urge to vomit.~
@446  = ~You are unwell, m'lady?~
@447  = ~Lady? I am no lady!~
@448  = ~I would venture that we are all privy to that fact. Although, may I say, Shar-Teel, that the color on your face at this moment is a match for any noblewoman's blush.~
@449  = ~You dare laugh at my expense?! How would you like my sword tickling your innards? I bet *that* would make you laugh.~
@450  = ~I did not aim to offend, my lady.~
@451  = ~You despise weakness, as you often say. Yet it seems to me that you are very poor at identifying it beyond the merely physical.~
@452  = ~Spare me your preaching, knightling.~
@453  = ~I do not preach, but merely consider the facts. You perceive strength in the sword-arm, but not in the character, which permits cooperation among many.~
@454  = ~And why would I want to work with many? The *many* are but ants, just waiting to be crushed.~
@455  = ~And yet ants endure. If you must compare the soldiers of the Order to insects, say rather 'bees.' You might find that they possess quite a sting, even as they fall before you - as you claim.~
@456  = ~A bee sting is nothing to one who knows how to handle her wounds.~
@457  = ~You are correct to say that one sting does little serious injury. But many stings are a different matter.~
@458  = ~Not to a warrior who must have her honey or starve.~
@459  = ~If you follow your logic to the end, you will try one day to prove your protestations by unlawfully usurping power and making yourself the mistress of Baldur's Gate!~
@460  = ~The 'honey' of Baldur's Gate is poison, Ajantis.~
@461  = ~You laugh at me, and think my words mere vainglory. But one day I will make my own place in this world... where none shall tread, except by my leave. What do you say to that?~
@462  = ~I hope that it is far from here, then. The Order has enough to do as it is.~
@463  = ~Ah, yes! Your precious Order! Don't delude yourself, charlatan. Your ambitions are no less than my own! You would rule too, if you could... but, starry-eyed dolt that you are, you can't.~
@464  = ~You really don't see any further than that, do you? Know then, that the Order would not rule. Rather, our task is to enable those who *do* rule to do so with honor and justice.~
@465  = ~Then you're even more foolish than mercenaries in the service of gold. At least they have the sense to collect something useful when taking their goods to market.~
@466  = ~Do not bark on subjects which you know nothing about! We of the Order *are* paid, though not in visible coin. And there will come a day when people of the civilized lands will understand that Honor is the better payment, for its value only increases with use, whereas gold is lost, once spent.~
@467  = ~Gods, is there no honest warrior here? One who fights for the salt-taste of a foe's blood and the thrill of slaying him... not for words or gold?~
@468  = ~You are one of a kind, Shar-Teel. I do not believe we require another.~
@469  = ~Shar-Teel, I have a question for you. Do you hate rats?~
@470  = ~Ho! I see that you have climbed one tree too many lately, druid. What kind of question is this?~
@471  = ~A simple enough one for you to answer. I repeat: "Do you hate rats?"~
@472  = ~No, I don't hate rats, but I don't care for them, either. Now, do you want to ask how I feel about groundhogs, as well, or is there some point to this talk?~
@473  = ~Ooh, and let there be questions about hamsters!~
@474  = ~No, child, we shall arrive at the point of my question in time. Now if you had to slay one rat, dog or deer, which would be your first choice?~
@475  = ~Slaying animals? *snort* You're thinking about a career change, I see.~
@476  = ~To answer your question, I would slay whichever is nearest, or whichever threatens me the most.~
@477  = ~But you would not aim for the rat, particularly?~
@478  = ~No.~
@479  = ~It is as I had thought. You would not bear particular ill will toward the weakest of your enemies in a fight. In fact, you aim for that which is strongest; in your own words, the one which threatens you the most.~
@480  = ~I wonder: why it is that you do not adhere to this philosophy in your everyday actions?~
@481  = ~Meaning?~
@482  = ~That you have a disgust for weakness, which overwhelms your every word. Truly, you must learn that there is no worth in cutting down those who are weak, even in conversation.~
@483  = ~You loudly proclaim your 'freedom', female, yet you bear <CHARNAME>'s mastery remarkably well.~
@484  = ~No <MANWOMAN> can claim to rule me! Whoever dares to do so, dies... plain and simple.~
@485  = ~Does not the wael who abuses you deserve a richer punishment?~
@486  = ~The stink of their innards, spilled at my feet, is rich enough. Why draw out one idiot's death, when I could be slitting open the next man from neck to knee?~
@487  = ~It surprises me that you have not faded into a dull stupor before this date, ingesting as you do such paltry, tasteless meals for vengeance.~
@488  = ~How can blood be tasteless, foolish drow?~
@489  = ~I find my succor through other delights, elg'caress. Blood may, or may not, be involved.~
@490  = ~Turn your lustful gaze elsewhere, rivvil, lest you discover, how such presumption is treated among my people.~
@491  = ~'Lustful gaze'?! If all drow are this idiotic, it's no wonder they creep below the earth like worms!~
@492  = ~As do illithid, beholders and demons, by your feeble geography. Do you suppose that such as they will shrivel and die under your hot-eyed gaze?~
@493  = ~My gaze was directed at your heart. I wonder, does it bleed black or red?~
@494  = ~*You* would waste the opportunity to find out, should it ever befall.~
@495  = ~I would say black, though blood is blood, and its smell is exciting, whatever the color.~
@496  = ~Tell me, drow, how it feels to have male dogs clamber all over you and deposit their filthy slobber on your black flesh?~
@497  = ~Such a brash and idiotic question could only have been delivered by a surfacer.~
@498  = ~Ah, but of course, *you* have not known the pleasures of another's touch. You are curious about my most sensual acts? Or perhaps your jealousy is getting the better of you, hmm?~
@499  = ~Why should I be jealous of a common slut?!~
@500  = ~'Tis you who are 'common', elg'caress. Your senses know no outlet but killing, and even in this, you have no art. A few grunts, a spurt, and all is over.~
@501  = ~What a shame it was that <CHARNAME> helped you escape the Fist. We should have slaughtered the lot of you.~
@502  = ~Indeed, all your senses are corrupted by haste, rivvil. Perhaps I shall teach you the ecstasies of dying... by hours and days, hmmm?~
@503  = ~Shar-Teel, do you *really* believe that strength of arm is all that is needed in this world?~
@504  = ~No! Strength of heart matters still more.~
@505  = ~And what if the world refuses to be bludgeoned by that strong arm, no matter how much heart is put into it?~
@506  = ~Your example is pointless - the beings of this world know that strength will have the last word.~
@507  = ~So, you're going to conquer the world? With just one arm, too. Most enterprising of you.~
@508  = ~Your 'noble' blood seems to be good for nothing but making stupid remarks about some unguessed future.~
@509  = ~My remarks are not blind stabs in the dark, but thoughtful inquiries, based on fact and conjecture. Some of us call that 'intelligence'.~
@510  = ~Don't point your 'intelligence' at me, then! Use it up in guesses about tomorrow. When it arrives, we will see who is its master.~
@511  = ~<CHARNAME>! Be careful, do not pick that up!~
@512  = ~Huh?~
@513  = ~Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.~
@514  = ~Do not pick what up? That enormous gibberling poo that you are about to step in?~
@515  = ~Don't worry, I wasn't planning to, I was just looking around.~
@516  = ~I thought you were about to pick up the leaves of that plant. Do you know what kind of plant that is?~
@517  = ~Err, no... not really.~
@518  = ~Hmm, come to think of it, that looks a lot like henbane. ~
@519  = ~Are you sure, <CHARNAME>? It takes a very skilled and experienced healer to safely prepare a poultice from henbane. One that does not poison and kill the patient, that is.~
@520  = ~Hen... henb... that is... henbane?~
@521  = ~It is difficult indeed, but I have done it before. One of the priests of Oghma taught me the knowledge.~
@522  = ~Gah! Oh, you are so funny, <CHARNAME>. But never mind that. I thought you were about to pick up the leaves of that plant. Do you know what kind of plant that is?~
@523  = ~*groan* I should have expected as much, with all your druidic lore coming from the tomes of Candlekeep. It seems that your practical skills are sorely lacking, but fortunately you can always count on my advice to rectify that. Now, sit down, and let me tell you a few things about henbane and its properties...~
@524  = ~Yes, you are correct, it is the highly intoxicating henbane. But it is not to be completely disregarded by an experienced healer. Do you know why?~
@525  = ~No, I'm afraid I don't know. ~
@526  = ~I have read that a poultice made from henbane is a very potent painkiller.~
@527  = ~And I am sure that you are very good at it, <CHARNAME>. However, since you are comparatively inexperienced, would you mind if I take a look at how you prepare that poultice? I might be able to offer some advice to make it even more effective.~
@528  = ~Of course you can watch, I would appreciate more tips!~
@529  = ~Uh-huh. Trying to steal the secrets of my trade, are you? Nothing doing, sister, I'm not sharing my secrets so easily!~
@530  = ~A poultice made from henbane is a very potent painkiller, <CHARNAME>. Now, allow me to gather some leaves of the plant, and during our next stop, I will show you how to make a very effective henbane poultice.~
@531  = ~You have heard correctly, <CHARNAME>. However, it would be helpful to the group if you knew how to prepare this poultice yourself, so allow me to gather some leaves of the plant, and during our next stop, I will show you how to make a very effective henbane poultice.~
@532  = ~I will be glad to give them, <CHARNAME>, thank you.~
@533  = ~Prying your secrets? There is no such thing between two healers who want to work efficiently to best serve the group. But be petty if you wish, <CHARNAME>. I will be equally petty in sending my advice your way.~
@534  = ~Ah. I thought you were about to pick up leaves of that plant. Do you know what kind of plant that is?~
@535  = ~<CHARNAME>, it occurs to me that since you have had so few opportunities to explore Nature more closely while within the walls of Candlekeep, you might have missed out on even the most rudimentary knowledge that a druid living in a grove would have received at the earliest stages of their education. I propose... a small test, so that I can gauge the level of your abilities. Would you be willing to participate?~
@536  = ~A test? Of course, I'm up for that! ~
@537  = ~No, thanks, we have more important things to do here than silly tests for your amusement. ~
@538  = ~Will it hurt? ~
@539  = ~Very well. I was thinking about having you guess bird songs, that should be telling enough. Let us start off with something easy. Listen to the song coming from that bush ahead. What bird is making those noises?~
@540  = ~That *honk-honk-whistle-honk-whistle*? Sounds like a regular starling to me. ~
@541  = ~Oh my, that is surely the carnivorous Chultan ostrich, hiding in those bushes and waiting for an opportunity to ambush us! ~
@542  = ~Hmph. Very well, I will not insist, but nor will I offer any further advice to contribute to your growth as a druid.~
@543  = ~No, it will not hurt. I was thinking about having you guess bird songs, that should be telling enough. Very well, let us start off with something easy. Listen to the song coming from that bush ahead. What bird is making those noises?~
@544  = ~That was too easy, indeed. Let us try something else. Many druids also know how to imitate bird calls, and I possess this skill as well. Now listen and try to guess what bird I am imitating. *Jaheira gives a delicate, very complicated whistle that at times almost turns into chirping.*~
@545  = ~That's a swallow. Barn-swallow, to be exact. ~
@546  = ~Uh, a magpie? ~
@547  = ~A half-elven female, making silly whistling sounds? ~
@548  = ~You are being deliberately insulting. Very well, I can see that my advice is not wanted here.~
@549  = ~Very good! Now, how about this one? *This time Jaheira starts off with quiet imitation of hooting that turns into something of a wail and then almost to what could be described as a yodeling sound, ending with a rapid, trembling whistle that you have never heard before.*~
@550  = ~That is a difficult one indeed, but I do believe some parts of that call sounded a lot like loon's song. ~
@551  = ~It must have been a cuckoo, I think. Yes, a cuckoo it was. ~
@552  = ~That's a quail! ~
@553  = ~Not quite, <CHARNAME>. It was a swallow. Now, if you did not guess that one, I do not have much hope in you guessing the next, but let us try nevertheless, shall we? *This time Jaheira starts off with quiet imitation of hooting that turns into something of a wail and then almost to what could be described as a yodeling sound, ending with a rapid, trembling whistle that you have never heard before.*~
@554  = ~Grrr! Insufferable! You are completely and totally insufferable, and I am done teaching you! Never again!~
@555  = ~I am truly impressed, <CHARNAME>. You will grow into a wise and powerful druid yet, I am even more convinced of it now! Especially if you keep listening to my advice.~
@556  = ~Well, actually it was a loon's call, <CHARNAME>. But it was a difficult one to recognize, I know that. We still have some work to do, if you want to turn into a powerful, capable druid, but that is why you have me here, to guide you.~
@557  = ~<CHARNAME>, I was thinking... you have grown to be a staunch defender of Nature, and I can teach you much to grow even further, but there are some things that I cannot give to you, and that you cannot learn yourself. And without these things, you cannot truly call yourself a druid.~
@558  = ~What are those things?~
@559  = ~Hey! I am a powerful druid already, I'll have you know that!~
@560  = ~You have grown in power and knowledge of the druidic lore, but you still are not one of us, for one reason. You have not found yourself within our druidic circle, nor realized your place in our hierarchy, nor your role in protecting the wilderness. To be truly recognized as a druid, you must join a druidic circle.~
@561  = ~I would like that. How do I join?~
@562  = ~Join a druid circle? Pfft. I can do just fine on my own, thank you very much.~
@563  = ~You are a druid only because you call yourself that, but the rest of our people would not acknowledge you for one reason. You have not found yourself within our druidic circle, nor realized your place in our hierarchy, nor your role in protecting the wilderness. To be truly recognized as a druid, you must join a druidic circle.~
@564  = ~Well, for now, our quest to punish the murderer of Gorion must take precedence. But once we are done with that, I can take you back to the druids of Cloakwood, or, perhaps, Larswood, so that you can complete your initiation rites. You are capable, and these rites will hardly prove a challenge for you.~
@565  = ~Sounds like fun! Count me in, I can't wait to find out if the druids really are as uninhibited as the books say!~
@566  = ~So, what happens after I join?~
@567  = ~You are missing out on an opportunity to benefit from knowledge and experience, collected over many a millennia. It is a mistake you are making, and I hope you will reconsider, before it is too late.~
@568  = ~*chuckle* It is a deal, then. For now, though, let us get back to the task at hand.~
@569  = ~You would be encouraged to study, to gain an in-depth insight about the druid ethos to help you find your place within the Great Cycle. There would be powerful druids at the grove, able to teach you more of the wilderness lore than I could. You would learn about more methods on how druids can work to preserve and protect the wilderness. Physical training is not neglected either, you could spar with many fellow druids to improve yourself. Then, through challenges, you could advance your position in the circle.~
@570  = ~Very well, you have convinced me. Once our task is done, I want you to take me to Cloakwood.~
@571  = ~What will you do in the meantime?~
@572  = ~I am glad, <CHARNAME>. For now, though, let us get back to the task at hand.~
@573  = ~Khalid and I will go with you and stay at the grove for a while. I might be a capable servant of Nature, but there still is much for me to learn. And, perhaps, later we can return to adventuring together, who can say.~
@574  = ~After... after our task is done, I will need a place where to sit and think in quiet contemplation. I must deal with my loss, if I am to move onward with my life, and where to do it best than amongst my kin? But enough of these maudlin thoughts, let us get back to the task at hand.~
@575  = ~Hey! I resent that!~
@576  = ~Do you know anyone by the name of Koveras?~
@577  = ~Thank you for helping us.~
@578  = ~Actually I did kill them, but they're the leaders of the Iron Throne.  They were the people behind the iron shortage and everything else that's been wrong with the Sword Coast.  We did everyone a favor by killing them. ~
