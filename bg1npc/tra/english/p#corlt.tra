@0    = ~Sweetling, you look in need of a cheering up.~
@1    = ~Care to listen, <CHARNAME>?~
@2    = ~First, I do not require cheering up. Second, I am no sweetling for the likes of you, and third, I can read you like a book! So I tell you outright: abandon every hope of getting into my bedroll.~
@3    = ~Yes... light entertainment would be timely indeed.~
@4    = ~You can sing?~
@5    = ~Ah, I shall hope as long as I draw breath. But you are mistaking my motives, my lady. It is only a humorous song, nothing bawdy or indecent.~
@6    = ~Well, keep breathing, but stop hoping.~
@7    = ~Very well, let us hear that song of yours.~
@8    = ~For fortnight we're fighting goblins
In the forest and in the swamp
We're soaked through to the bone
What would you do? That's our job. 
For fortnight, we saw no towns 
We grew wild, hungry, and crude
Yesterday three gnomes drowned
And the fourth one went into soup.~
@9    = ~Chewing endlessly dry pine needles 
For breakfast, for lunch, and for dinner
I'm looking at you, and thinking: 'My dear, 
What in the Hells are you doing here?'
You, my precious lady, are fair of face,
You are gentler than winds of Kythorn
You should honor the kings with your grace
Not adventure with we vagabonds.~
@10   = ~That was a good song, Coran. Thank you!~
@11   = ~Bah! I will have you know that I will adventure as much as I want! And 'precious,' indeed... I do not care at all for such 'romance.'~
@12   = ~Coran, it is very sweet of you to compliment me, but you are mistaken. I am as much a vagabond as yourself and the others.~
@13   = ~Chewing endlessly dry pine needles
For breakfast, for lunch, and for dinner
I'm looking at you, and thinking: 'My dear, 
What in the Hells are you doing here?'
You, my precious lady, are fair of face,
You are gentler than winds of Kythorn
You should honor the kings with your grace
Not adventure with we vagabonds.~
@14   = ~A beautiful lady without mercy. A rare type to meet, and so enticing. A man can be in love with such a lady for his entire life.~
@15   = ~Your smile is a wonderful sight and the dearest reward for a singer. May the wind be always warm on your face, <CHARNAME>.~
@16   = ~I know that my lady is a mighty adventurer, not a porcelain statuette from Shou. Yet I have noticed rare beauty in my lady, as well as other virtues. Do not be too shy to shine, <CHARNAME>. You are well set to take any man's heart.~
@17   = ~Most elves can sing quite pleasantly. And do you know, my dear lady, when elven voices sound the most suave?~
@18   = ~No, when?~
@19   = ~After love, of course.~
@20   = ~I am not really interested in talking about it. Now, leave me be and quit looking at me with those wanton eyes of yours!~
@21   = ~After love, my dear lady. But I assure you that my voice is good enough as is.~
@22   = ~Let me judge for myself. I will hear your song now.~
@23   = ~Maybe I shall test how true this statement is one of these days. Will you sing the song though, so I can compare?~
@24   = ~Coran, I will never fall for your doubtful charms. Now, leave me be!~
@25   = ~Indeed. I see that you have adequate knowledge of elven ways.~
@26   = ~I am an elf, Coran, just like you. *wink* Perhaps one day we can make a fine duet! I will gladly hear your song now... to have a point of comparison.~
@27   = ~Coran, I am an elf myself! But I will not fall for your cheap tricks. If you and I were the last two elves in the world, and the survival of our kind depended on it, then and only then would I have considered you seriously as a mate.~
@28   = ~No, but I have heard you saying it to almost every woman of childbearing age we have met. But go ahead, give your song.~
@29   = ~A guess, nothing more. Everyone sings better after love. *wink* Perhaps one day we can make a fine duet! I will gladly hear your song now... to have a point of comparison.~
@30   = ~Coran, I do not want to discuss anything with you. I do not want to hear your singing, either.~
@31   = ~<CHARNAME>, <CHARNAME>, I hope that one of these days you shall abandon your scowl for a smile. It would suit you nicely.~
@32   = ~I know a song which a man can sing to his adventuring companion should she happen to be a fair lady and in need of a smile...~
@33   = ~My, a song like that is always good to know! Sing on, Coran! Now, uh, where's my notebook...~
@34   = ~You better sing to her that the scars she got the other day do not show all that much. That will cheer her up.~
@35   = ~*sighs* Coran, Coran...~
@36   = ~That was chivalrously said, elf.~
@37   = ~With the way our misadventure is going, a requiem is more in order.~

@39   = ~Three gnomes drowned and fourth one went into soup? Now *that* doesn't sound very likely. Personally, I'd suggest dwarves - they are mentally inferior to my kind, after all, and utterly lacking personal hygiene...~
@40   = ~Not a single word more about gnomes, Master Quayle, I promise you.~
@41   = ~There is perfection in every woman, yet no woman is perfection. Alas.~
@42   = ~That's what you are searching for, Coran? Perfection? You are setting yourself up for a disappointment.~
@43   = ~In this case, Coran, your only hope is to turn your searching gaze elsewhere. But I think that you would find males no less flawed than females.~
@44   = ~Why do you say that?~
@45   = ~There is one. Me.~
@46   = ~Fear not, I can cope with the disappointment. I invented a peculiar system. I believe there is a perfection in every woman: one has an earlobe made for the most gentle kisses, another can dance you into the ground, and yet another's eyes spell trouble most irresistibly... so, when put together, they make a beautiful image.~
@47   = ~You... collect women like pieces of a mosaic? That's disgusting, Coran!~
@48   = ~How interesting. I think that it can be successfully used with men as well. One can protect you against dragons and other such things, another will read you poetry, yet another is good for... other pleasures.~
@49   = ~*laughs* Indeed.~
@50   = ~I was looking at you and could not find any fault but one. And usually, one woman has an ear lobe made for the most gentle kisses, another can dance you into the ground, and yet another's eyes spell trouble most irresistibly. So when put together, they make the perfect woman of my dreams.~
@51   = ~And what is this one fault you find in me?~
@52   = ~Ah, you are as near to perfection as any I have ever seen, lacking but one important detail: you are not in love with me. *sigh* I have hope, however, that that will be amended...~
@53   = ~I think you misunderstood me. I do not wish to spoil the pleasures of love by becoming a lover to more than one woman at the same time, but I notice the beauty of others and remember it. In fact, I believe that with some women, you should *not* be in love with them in order to love them...~
@54   = ~Coran, what are you babbling about? That makes no sense!~
@55   = ~You mean this odd, sweet feeling which sprouts in your soul when you know that you are in love with another, and he, with you? When you do not have to prove anything, or conquer him, but just stand there and enjoy his company, and feel proud and sad that no 'what if' thoughts ever crossed your mind?~
@56   = ~Coran, Coran. You think too much of women for your own good. Can you do it in silence for a while? We really ought to be going.~
@57   = ~I... I sometimes had this odd, sweet feeling. I did not have to prove anything or conquer her. I simply enjoyed her company and her grace. And I felt proud and sad that no 'what if' thoughts ever crossed my mind. What is it if not the noblest form of love? To wish someone every happiness and wish not for anything in return?~
@58   = ~That, Coran, is called camaraderie. Not love. Is it so inconceivable to you to have a lady friend who does not share your bed?~
@59   = ~Maybe you are capable of deeper feelings than I had thought.~
@60   = ~Coran, Coran. What does it matter if it is love or not? We really ought to be going now.~
@61   = ~A man who thinks too little of women is heading for troubles.~
@62   = ~<CHARNAME> of Candlekeep is one. A woman as near to perfection as I ever seen. But one tiny little detail was lacking: she was not in love with me. *sigh* But I have hope that that will be amended...~
@63   = ~Not so loud, if you please! I have a reputation to live up to, you know.~
@64   = ~Yes, my friend. Sometimes I think that it is the noblest form of love. To wish someone every happiness and wish not for anything in return?~
@65   = ~Love means life, <CHARNAME>, and one can never think of these two things too much.~
@66   = ~Wake up, beautiful... My, did I startle you? I am Coran, your companion and... oh! The flowers, right?~
@67   = ~I've dreamt a dream that I met the twelve months who took the form of elvenkind. They sat together by a campfire and when they saw me they asked what I was doing. I said: 'I am looking for a flower for the lady of my heart.'~
@68   = ~Before I knew it each of them offered me a flower, except for Hammer; He gave me a birch branch crusted with ice... Severe on the surface, but gentle at its heart. Alturiak gave me a snowdrop and inconstant Chess presented me with a violet for you. Mild Tarsakh produced a daffodil, and Mirtul sent his kind regards with this Lilly of the valley...~
@69   = ~Coran, did you break into a wizard's garden?~
@70   = ~The ice... why does it not melt from the branch?!~
@71   = ~*Sigh and allow Coran to continue his recital.*~
@72   = ~But you do *have* the flowers! I thought you said it was a dream!?~
@73   = ~I am glad that you think me skilled enough to steal from wizards in my sleep, but alas, I did not. Do you want to know what happened, or do you want just to take the flowers and kiss me?~
@74   = ~Well, Boo is running out of food and toiletries... That will likely serve both purposes. Do you prefer to give that broom directly to Minsc, or should I serve as a middle-woman?~
@75   = ~The story, Coran, the story! I will not interrupt again... well, I'll try not to.~
@76   = ~To tell you the truth, I am growing tired of your stories. The flowers will suffice.~
@77   = ~Three kisses, if you shut up and throw away the assorted flora you are waving under my nose!~
@78   = ~I am getting to that. So, do you want to know what happened, or do you want just to take the flowers and kiss me?~
@79   = ~The story, Coran, the story! I will not interrupt again...well, I'll try not to.~
@80   = ~Generous Kythorn gifted you with a peony, and from passionate Flamerule I received a daisy. Splendid Eleasias asked me to give you this aster. Eleint presented me a proud gladiolus, and Marpenoth conjured a dahlia out of the last warm rays of the sun. Uktar furrowed his brow when he saw what his kin were doing; however, when his turn came, he had a chrysanthemum for you. This carnation is from Nigtal.~
@81   = ~Coran, the truth is that you broke into a wizard's garden, did you not? If so, you had better confess now, for we need to prepare to do battle. Fearsome is a gardener's fury, and listen to reason, he will not-~
@82   = ~Coran, the ice on the birch branch... it does not melt!~
@83   = ~Right. Nigtal gave me a carnation. And?~
@84   = ~I'd give the flowers to Boo, but I am afraid that Minsc might get jealous. So it will have to be you.~
@85   = ~Boo! Boo! See what <CHARNAME> has for you?~
@86   = ~I... I reconsidered. I'll hang onto them. But no silly stories, please.~
@87   = ~On second thought... Tell me the rest of the tale, Coran.~
@88   = ~I did get these flowers from the twelve months, <CHARNAME>. I don't think they will ever wither... not exactly my kind of thing, but here they are.~
@89   = ~You are the most amazing woman, my sweet! Come kiss me, and let us forget about silly magical flowers.~
@90   = ~You think I would dare to invoke such peril on my sweet <CHARNAME>?~
@91   = ~No, I did not rob a magical garden, nor did I sneak away to Evermeet... I simply reveried and then woke and thought: what a dream!~
@92   = ~And then I realized that I was standing with my hands full of flowers, the very same ones I got in the dream for you. Imagine that! One flower for each month in a season!~
@93   = ~Being an elf has its inconveniences, sweetling. Random magical occurrences with unknown consequences... and other such things.~
@94   = ~Do you often... erm... walk in your reveries?~
@95   = ~Oh... Wow... Ah!... Uhm...~
@96   = ~You... you brought me flowers from the twelve months? Oh, Coran, why could not you just go with red roses, like every other man? That would have said 'I love you' as clear as if it were written on every petal! Now I do not know *what* to think!~
@97   = ~Thank you! Oh, thank you! These are wonderful!~
@98   = ~Because it's magical, sweetling. I doubt that these flowers will wither... You see, after I woke, I thought: what a dream!~
@99   = ~Being an elf has its inconveniences, sweetling. Random magical occurrences with unknown consequences...and other such things.~
@100  = ~I woke and I thought: what a dream!~
@101  = ~And then I saw that I stood with my hands full of flowers, the very same ones I got in the dream for you. Imagine that! One flower for each month in a season!~
@102  = ~Being an elf has its inconveniences, sweetling. Random magical occurrences with unknown consequences... and other such things.~
@103  = ~Yes, Boo, see what <CHARNAME> has for you? Go ahead with your morning deposit and make it a good one!~
@104  = ~There is a first time for everything. You are a bad influence on me, sweetling.~
@105  = ~Exactly. That makes two of us incapable of speaking coherently when confronted with a bunch of magical flowers. I don't think they will ever wither... not exactly my kind of a thing, but here they are.~
@106  = ~Well, sweetling, I was looking for flowers for you in the oddest of places... Does that not convey the same gentle message as the rose petals? Those flowers will never wither either, at least I don't think they will... but do not jump to conclusions because of it!~
@107  = ~*smile* And you are quite welcome.~
@108  = ~Do not be afraid of my love, <CHARNAME>. It is not such a fearful thing. I love tenderly, gently...~
@109  = ~You are forgetting 'inconstantly.'~
@110  = ~Erm... I am lost. Are you confessing your love to me, Coran, or you are simply rehearsing the pick-up lines?~
@111  = ~And why do you think that I am afraid of your love, Coran?~
@112  = ~I... I love you, too.~
@113  = ~Is it a fault? What is constant? Look at the mountains, beloved <CHARNAME>, even they are not eternal, and they are made of a hard stone. You and I, we are made of flesh, not of stone. Why should I pretend to be a mountain?~
@114  = ~No matter how fine your words are, I cannot bring myself to believe that they are sincere. I do not know if you love me. I do not know if there is such an oath that you will not foreswear.~
@115  = ~Because that is how I want to love and to be loved, Coran. Eternally. I do not want to follow the rules, I want to be an exception. You need to be a mountain to have your head in the clouds.~
@116  = ~Well said, my friend, well said. I think that I might adopt this inconstant approach of yours...~
@117  = ~Never rehearse anything when flirting, for then you will be truly unprepared, caught in your own imagination. Courtship is an improvisation game, <CHARNAME>, not a bard's play where everyone simply says what was written. I am confessing my love to you, my lady, and it is your turn. Surprise me with 'yes' or challenge me with 'no.'~
@118  = ~*Stay silent and smile quizzically.*~
@119  = ~I believe that I am too young to play this game with the likes of you. It is safer for me to stay away.~
@120  = ~Ah, Coran... when you look at me like this, I cannot deny you anything. I... I love you.~
@121  = ~Did I misjudge the trembling of your eyelashes when you looked at me, and the uncertainty, nesting in the corners of your lips? Prove me wrong, <CHARNAME>. A sweet kiss will convince me.~
@122  = ~Do you take me for a complete fool? I know you well enough not to follow my silly little heart, no matter how I feel about you. I will not end up as yet another notch on your belt!~
@123  = ~I opened my heart to you, is not that enough?~
@124  = ~*kiss Coran* Is that sweet enough for you?~
@125  = ~I gather that you are a man who likes thrills. Here is a dangerous game for you, then: Kiss me, Coran, and I will either kiss you back like you have never been kissed before, or I will slap you. You will not know until you try which one it will be.~
@126  = ~Sweet words to hear. I wonder if your kiss is as sweet, <CHARNAME>?~
@127  = ~I gather that you are a man who likes thrills. Here is a dangerous game for you, then: kiss me, Coran, and I will either kiss you back like you have never been kissed before, or I will slap you. You will not know until you try which one it will be.~
@128  = ~I like the way you say might. A sweet kiss to seal the deal, my Lady?~
@129  = ~The bones are rigid, and the heart is soft. A man will survive a broken bone, but will not live with his heart pierced by an arrow. Do not think with your bones, think with your heart, and then you will see that I am sincere.~
@130  = ~Waiting and chasing are the two most difficult things in life, <CHARNAME>... especially if you are waiting for and chasing a dream. Take a peak through the clouds and see what the Faerun is like. Perhaps you shall like what you see.~
@131  = ~You know how to hold a pause. Bravo, <CHARNAME>. You are skilled in the game, yet appear innocent of the knowledge. *bows* That betrays the true master, My Lady. I am officially giving you my heart to wear in your belt pouch... or behind your corsage, which I would much prefer.~
@132  = ~That is a mistake, <CHARNAME>. When the heart is young, it learns swiftly but can go wild without a teacher. A more experienced man is a better tutor than a novice.~
@133  = ~I do not think that you are a fool, <CHARNAME>, and your heart is neither silly, not small. That is why I do not lie to you or give you the false promises.~
@134  = ~You opened your heart and I entered, just like you came into mine. Now we only need to seal the doors, to keep the rest of the world away. And what better lock than a kiss?~
@135  = ~Wouldn't a thief rather *open* a lock?~
@136  = ~Do you always move that quickly into unknown terrain, Coran?~
@137  = ~I am not falling for your pretentious declarations, artful as they are. I know you well enough not to follow my silly little heart. It does not matter how I feel about you. I will not end up as yet another notch on your belt!~
@138  = ~It is sweet... but you know what's many times sweeter than a kiss? Many kisses, <CHARNAME>. I shall prove you this simple rule one day.~
@139  = ~I gambled for lesser prizes. Let us see if Lady Luck is jealous of you, <CHARNAME>. *Coran cups <CHARNAME>'s chin with his fingers and kisses her lips.*~
@140  = ~*You respond to the kiss with all passion you can master.*~
@141  = ~*As soon as Coran's lips touch yours, you give Coran a heavy handed slap and jump away, wiping your mouth in disgust.*~
@142  = ~*You respond to the kiss, but slap Coran's face softly.*~
@143  = ~Perhaps your beauty made me lose my head? M'lady, I lost myself so completely in the depth of your eyes that even my ways have changed. I never felt such passion, such admiration, or such noble trepidations of soul as I feel now, standing by your side, looking at you... I swear, I love you!~
@144  = ~*chuckle* Here is your kiss. You earned it by your readiness to say that sort of nonsense. *kiss Coran*~
@145  = ~I think your ways stayed just the same as they always had been. And I will not kiss you even if you spend the whole night trying to talk me into it. So do not waste your time!~
@146  = ~Am I to believe that Coran of Tethyr has fallen in love for the first time?~
@147  = ~*smile* If you do feel so strongly, my friend, then a few short days... or weeks... or even years should change nothing.~
@148  = ~*Somehow Coran makes the kiss to last as if some wizard cast a time stopping spell on you. When finally you pull away from one another, Coran's tilted eyes are darker than you remember.*~
@149  = ~Ouch! You are going to lose a valuable companion this way. I am no mage, but I still need my brains. Unless you intended me to forget the taste of your lips... but I never will.~
@150  = ~You give and you take at the same time. Bravo, <CHARNAME>. You are skilled in the game, yet appear innocent of the knowledge. *bows* That betrays the true master, my Lady. I am officially giving you my heart to wear in your belt pouch... or behind your corsage, which I would much prefer.~
@151  = ~I...I will talk to you after you grow a heart, <CHARNAME>.~
@152  = ~Not for the first time, <CHARNAME>, but maybe for the very last time... who knows? We can all die before the sand leaves the cup of the hourglass.~
@153  = ~Still, let us wait.~
@154  = ~Maybe... but do I deserve to die without even knowing the taste of your lips?~
@155  = ~*chuckle* Here is your kiss. You earned it by your readiness to say that sort of nonsense. *kiss Coran* Is it sweet enough for you?~
@156  = ~*You kiss Coran with all passion you can master.*~
@157  = ~There is emptiness about. It is hanging in the air and is going round and round, sneaking up on us. Look, it's already in your bedroll!~
@158  = ~And the gods sent you to combat it... in my bedroll?~
@159  = ~My bedroll is quite safe, thank you very much.~
@160  = ~The turmoil of my days makes me love the emptiness of my nights, Coran.~
@161  = ~You are right! And it has already consumed yours! Together we can save mine at least!~
@162  = ~*giggle and smile invitingly*~
@163  = ~I hoped that you'd see it that way.~
@164  = ~Hope is a wonderful emotion, Coran. One can almost live off it.~
@165  = ~A gold piece to you for your imaginative approach, but I do not think that I need an ally to face the horrors of the night. Not yet.~
@166  = ~*smile confidently* Yes, I do.~
@167  = ~Darling, I see a crossroad of two ways here. Yours and mine...~
@168  = ~I was mistaken then. It's a relief to know that you are out of danger. You are sure that you do not need an extra cloak? A bedtime story? A...~
@169  = ~I require nothing at the moment. You may go now, Coran.~
@170  = ~Let us enjoy the safety then, but... apart.~
@171  = ~A bedtime story would be nice.~
@172  = ~Another cloak may come handy.~
@173  = ~Loving emptiness is a way to induce turmoil of the heart, for it requires substance to live on.~
@174  = ~The substance called imagination?~
@175  = ~And loving you in turn brings emptiness to the heart, as the substance is illusionary.~
@176  = ~Perhaps I can fill one night and see if it shall quell my heart, for it is in uproar.~
@177  = ~I move at the enemy then! It's going to be one epic battle, <CHARNAME>. The bards shall sing about it in the ages to come.~
@178  = ~I trust that you will not divulge any details to the minstrels, Coran? In order not to hinder their imagination, of course.~
@179  = ~The songs I write are unrivaled, Coran. Hopefully, I will not have to exaggerate your prowess in battles fought amongst the sheets too much.~
@180  = ~Onward, to strike at the emptiness!~
@181  = ~Wipe that smug grin right off your face, Coran. I will stand up to the emptiness alone tonight.~
@182  = ~By the Golden Rose! I'll drink the wine of the Year of the Great Harvests to your good nature, <CHARNAME>!~
@183  = ~There is no need to create a second Great Glacier, <CHARNAME>. One is quite enough for Faerun.~
@184  = ~I doubt that two glaciers would chill your eagerness, Coran. It would take a half-dozen at least. Have you ever thought of moving to Icewind Dale?~
@185  = ~One more stupid joke out of you, and I will tie you up to a wyvern's tail and let it loose... in the Cloudpeak Mountains.~
@186  = ~*giggle* I cannot stay angry with you for too long, elf. Perhaps fighting the emptiness under the blankets with you will prove fun. I'll give it a try.~
@187  = ~My captain, thou shalt find no ally more loyal to thy cause. Light the signal fires on the eve of the battle, and I shall come to your aid.~
@188  = ~There is something about crossroads that makes every adventurous heart beat faster. Perhaps it's because that's where you can choose a different direction.~
@189  = ~I prefer to stay off the roads altogether. I do not want to walk in the tracks of others.~
@190  = ~Follow me from this crossroad onward, stranger, and help me to fight off the emptiness of the night.~
@191  = ~But after a crossroad, the two ways can also run further and further apart, if you get my meaning.~
@192  = ~Coran, it's not that I am not enjoying chatting with you, but the gleam in your eye causes me great discomfort. Can we continue this discussion some other time?~
@193  = ~If I was not an elf, sweetling, I would happily have gone to my bedroll, knowing that like any other man of flesh and blood I'd dream about you in my embrace through the night. Alas, my kin reveries instead of dreaming, which means we relive events that occurred in our past.~
@194  = ~I am pretty sure that you will have a very pleasant reverie, full of beautiful women, majestic forests and treasure chests.~
@195  = ~So, being a man of flesh and blood, you will reverie about... some other woman, instead?~
@196  = ~Even an elf can sleep and dream, Coran, if he is so inclined. And I know that if you did that, you would get the dream you were just talking about. Or you can continue daydreaming about me. So there is no cause for you to complain.~
@197  = ~I... I did not think about it that way. I cannot bear that unhappy look in your eyes. I... I think we can create a beautiful memory for you, Coran.~
@198  = ~Our kin, sweetling, has the wonderful gift of reverie instead of sleep, reliving the events that occured in our past. Alas, that also means that I cannot dream about you in my embrace through the night, like any other man of flesh and blood would.~
@199  = ~So, being a man of flesh and blood, you will reverie about...some other woman instead?~
@200  = ~Take mine, sweetling, for I will not need it tonight. I want to love you, at least in my imagination. Since the wonderful gift of reverie replaces sleep, I cannot, like a human man, conjure a dream of something that has never happened... so, I'd rather stay wakeful and chase my illusive <CHARNAME>-fantasy.~
@201  = ~A bedtime story?~
@202  = ~There was a priestess of Hanali Celanil, who spent a thousand years studying during her every waking hour. She learned to predict what couldn't be predicted: the path of the snake through the sands and the birds' path through the clouds. I met her once and bowed to her wisdom. I asked her what she was trying to perceive now.~
@203  = ~'The most aleatory path of all,' she replied. 'The path of a man's heart to a woman's.' I laughed at her, since I thought then that I knew more than the wise priestess, and only after fifty years of learning.~
@204  = ~Now, I wish I had not been so arrogant, and had enrolled as her pupil. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@205  = ~Thank you, and good night to you, too.~
@206  = ~Indeed, you should have. You know naught of it.~
@207  = ~And you would be none the wiser, elf. Good night.~
@208  = ~Wait! Do not go. I... I changed my mind. My bedroll is indeed cold and empty without you.~
@209  = ~The substance called 'adventure.'~
@210  = ~Oh, then my heart is in no danger whatsoever. I found far too many of those already.~
@211  = ~In case you did not notice, I am trying to *avoid* that as hard as I can. Adventures, bah!~
@212  = ~Of course. Everything is an adventure to you!~
@213  = ~I have been told differently, <CHARNAME>. You will never learn the truth if you won't... experiment.~
@214  = ~I do know the truth, and it is that you are the most shallow man that ever existed. Now leave me be.~
@215  = ~Then let us experiment, but I will not live an illusion for long.~
@216  = ~Coran, I am too tired to continue this debate. Let us talk about something else... perhaps you can tell me a bedtime story...~
@217  = ~My lips are sealed, <CHARNAME>. Besides, mere words cannot describe the sweetness of loving you, so why waste them? Let me bare your gentle shoulders and hold you close.~
@218  = ~Icewind Dale? Frozen venison for breakfast, dried venison for lunch, salted venison for dinner, snow water with deer blood for wine, and barbarians in deerskin for women. Thank you, but no.~
@219  = ~Ah, fireheart, you look marvelous when you are angry.~
@220  = ~I am glad that you have passed my way, traveler. I'll let you sleep, then. You look like you need it.~
@221  = ~Indeed, that is inevitable. I have yet to discover if you praise or loathe the crossroad and the parting.~
@222  = ~I take it you are not inclined to talk to me today. Perhaps I'll have better luck on the morrow.~
@223  = ~Yes.~
@224  = ~You would not DARE!~
@225  = ~Go ahead, then. The campfire is nice and pleasant, but it is nothing when compared to the sun in all its glory.~
@226  = ~Good night, sweetling.~
@227  = ~But if you feel that the dangers are near, light the signal fires on the eve of the battle, and I shall come to your aid.~
@228  = ~And you do not approve? I cannot help you here, sweetling.~
@229  = ~I do not control what I see in my reveries, <CHARNAME>, but if I could I would conjure an image of the most passionate-~
@230  = ~Coran, your most passionate lover was an ice cube, compared to me. I am going to prove it to you right this moment!~
@231  = ~Go ahead, then. The campfire is nice and pleasant, but it is nothing compared to the sun in its full glory.~
@232  = ~*yawn* And so would I. Good night, Coran.~
@233  = ~I'll let the fires warm me up until I am able to bask in the sunlight.~
@234  = ~*stiffly* Good night.~
@235  = ~Sweetling, the way things are turning out... I have a feeling that someone's hand guides you. I do not like it, for it smells like a trap.~
@236  = ~I agree with you, and I suspect that the same man who killed my father is the one who pulls the strings. However, the trap is only deadly when you do not know that it is set for you. Perhaps we can spring this one in such a way that it will catch my father's murderer.~
@237  = ~You are exaggerating, Coran. Someone wants to kill me, but guide me into a trap? Nope. Don't think so.~
@238  = ~We will get through it one way or another, elf. And if not - so be it.~
@239  = ~And do you have any plan other than playing it by ear?~
@240  = ~That's my woman! *chuckles admiringly* I have done that before, and I can tell you that there is nothing more thrilling than a game of wits, especially when the stakes are high. Although, I've never had my life at stake.~
@241  = ~Anyone in our company is free to go, Coran. I... I would not force anyone into risking death on my account.~
@242  = ~Judging by the bounty notices, my life is not worth much, so I hope we win a fortune besides.~
@243  = ~I'd sure like to hear about any plans that succeeded.~
@244  = ~Be wary, <CHARNAME>. Do you think that I will allow you to get yourself killed because of carelessness? The traps are something you'd never have expected, <CHARNAME>! Take that time I played a lute-~
@245  = ~Coran, we cannot stop to banter right now.~
@246  = ~You played a lute?~
@247  = ~Next time I will be wary of answering any question you pose me, for fear of being trapped into hearing about yet another one of your escapades.~
@248  = ~Coran, I must warn you, that you have come dangerously close to making me believe that your feelings for me run deeper than lust.~
@249  = ~I won't let you get yourself killed! If you do not want to be wary, I'll be. I have been through a game or two of wits... take that time I played a lute, for example...~
@250  = ~Next time I will be wary of answering any question you pose me, for fear of being trapped into hearing about yet another one of your escapades.~
@251  = ~Coran, I must warn you that you have come dangerously close to making me believe that your feelings for me run deeper than lust.~
@252  = ~I suggest that we keep our eyes and ears peeled for any signs of betrayal or trap. I've played it by ear my whole life, and I managed just fine, but with your neck at stake, I'd rather be... the Nine Hells! I'd just rather be more cautious, <CHARNAME>.~
@253  = ~I made you into a coward!~
@254  = ~Coran the Cautious - does that mean that you are going to scratch your head *before* climbing wet cliffs on a stormy night?~
@255  = ~Right. I promise, I will be on guard, and if a trap does exist, perhaps we can spring it in such a way that it will catch the hunter.~
@256  = ~Did you just suggest that I leave you to fight it on your own? Thank you kindly, but someone has to figure out a way to keep you alive. I have been through a game or two of wits... take that time I played a lute, for example...~
@257  = ~Coran, I must warn you that you have come dangerously close to making me believe that your feelings for me run deeper than lust.~
@258  = ~Greed is the assassin of thieves. Your life is what's important, but worry not, if you should be distracted by gold, I'll ensure you don't get yourself killed. I have played a game or two of wits... take that time I played a lute, for example...~
@259  = ~Ah, it began when I saw a lady of exquisite beauty in the market square in Baldur's Gate. I was smitten on the spot, so I did not make further acquaintance. I later found out that she belonged to a powerful and rich family. Unfortunately, gaining admittance to her house was not an easy matter, until I learned that she was quite a connoisseur of the bardic arts and welcomed musicians under her roof.~
@260  = ~*laugh* Coran, did you really become a bard just to court some petty noblewoman?~
@261  = ~*roll your eyes, but stay silent*~
@262  = ~Coran, dear, *grind your teeth* you have a choice between being attacked by a furious and wicked female or shutting up *right this minute*! I cannot hear any more about your other women!~
@263  = ~*innocently* Then why are we standing around chattering?~
@264  = ~Surely, it cannot be that bad?~
@265  = ~*shrugs* I was always a risk taker. Even with that damned lute! You see, I saw a lady of exquisite beauty once, in the market square in Baldur's Gate. I was smitten on the spot, so I did not make further acquaintance. I later found out that she belonged to a powerful and rich family. Unfortunately, gaining admittance to her house was not an easy matter, until I learned that she was quite a connoisseur of the bardic arts and welcomed musicians under her roof.~
@266  = ~No, you did not, <CHARNAME>, though, perhaps, you made me wiser.~
@267  = ~Erm... well... that particular event was long ago and not entirely true... Do you want to hear the story about the lute? You see, I saw a lady of exquisite beauty once, in the market square in Baldur's Gate. I was smitten on the spot, so I did not make further acquaintance. I later found out that she belonged to a powerful and rich family. Unfortunately, gaining admittance to her house was not an easy matter, until I learned that she was quite a connoisseur of the bardic arts and welcomed musicians under her roof.~
@268  = ~*nods solemnly* We will get out of it unscathed, just like I did that other time... You see, I saw a lady of exquisite beauty once, in the market square in Baldur's Gate. I was smitten on the spot, so I did not make further acquaintance. I later found out that she belonged to a powerful and rich family. Unfortunately, gaining admittance to her house was not an easy matter, until I learned that she was quite a connoisseur of the bardic arts and welcomed musicians under her roof.~
@269  = ~I did not become the greatest minstrel of this age, but I did learn to play the lute. Alas, my talent, however small, made the lady's husband jealous. Or so I reasoned one night, when I was to play in the presence of a half-hundred guests and found all the strings of my lute gone.~
@270  = ~Are you sure it was the husband, not a competitor in the... artistic field?~
@271  = ~Oh, that is wicked! How did the lady take you leaving her guests without entertainment?~
@272  = ~You certainly deserved a little bit of humiliation.~
@273  = ~Should I restrict the accounts of my past to the times of my infancy, or would you rather get a Potion against Jealousy?~
@274  = ~You flatter me. *smiles* I am sure it was the husband. That is why I did play that night. I unstrung my bow and put the string on the lute.~
@275  = ~*laugh and wave for Coran to continue with the story*~
@276  = ~Did you get a standing ovation from the audience?~
@277  = ~Coran, I'll eat my flute raw if you'd replicate that!~
@278  = ~Oh, but they *were* entertained. I unstrung my bow and put the string on the lute.~
@279  = ~Perhaps, but not that night! I unstrung my bow and put the string on the lute.~
@280  = ~Even an elf cannot play well with only one string! But I announced before starting that it was a comical trick. You should have seen them all laughing as I plucked at that single string over and over again.~
@281  = ~Of course. You see, sweetling, before starting I announced that it was a comical trick. You should have seen them all laughing as I plucked at that single string over and over again.~
@282  = ~I'd rather you eat strawberries from my lips. Besides, I would never want to hear that sound again. But the audience was delighted. I had announced before starting that it was a comical trick. You should have seen them all laughing as I plucked at that single string over and over and over again.~
@283  = ~My love-~
@284  = ~My dearest-~
@285  = ~Love... *laugh bitterly* It is my shame and my madness that I allow a vagrant and a thief to court me freely.~
@286  = ~What is it?~
@287  = ~*look at Coran, smile and wait for him to continue*~
@288  = ~Were I a slave in Mulhorand, once a day I would catch a glimpse of your sandals while prostrating myself on the marble floor at your feet, and I would be the happiest man in Mulhorand.~
@289  = ~Mulhorand?~
@290  = ~I really, really doubt it.~
@291  = ~Are you trying to flatter me?~
@292  = ~Alas, my noble lady, none that follow you is anything like me.~
@293  = ~Indeed, no one is. Still, I am a fool of a woman for falling for you. I shall not... I will not let it go on any longer.~
@294  = ~Whatever... You were saying?~
@295  = ~You mean: so ready to fall for any woman who comes in sight, break into a person's house, or do something else stupid and wild?~
@296  = ~And, alas, when the moon shines, madness oft overcomes shame and common sense. Still I wish it hadn't been you I fell for. It would have been easier.~
@297  = ~There is a young man of suitable birth and disposition in the party... A *true* cavalier.~
@298  = ~Were I a slave in Mulhorand, once a day I would catch a glimpse of your sandals while prostrating myself on the marble floor by your feet and I would be the happiest man in Mulhorand.~
@299  = ~Are you trying to flatter me?~
@300  = ~Mulhorand is one of the old empires among sands, where pharaohs rule. It is very unlike Cormyr. Speaking of Cormyr... If I were a court bard at Suzail and you were my queen, I would have been hanged, my dearest.~
@301  = ~Hanged? But why?~
@302  = ~Coran, the day is done, we are alone, and you lecture me on the cultural, historical and geographical implications of our feelings?~
@303  = ~But I am not a queen of Cormyr, Coran, I am a <PRO_CLASS> from Candlekeep, and you are a rogue from Tethyr.~
@304  = ~Maybe you could try not to doubt me, for once? If I were a court bard at Suzail and you were my queen, I would have been hanged, my dearest.~
@305  = ~I will always doubt you, Coran.~

@307  = ~If I were a court bard at Suzail and you were my queen, I would have been hanged, my dearest.~
@308  = ~You are wasting your time, Coran. It's over...~
@309  = ~Coran, do you ever quit imagining things? I am no queen, I am a <CLASS> from Candlekeep, and you are a rogue from Tethyr.~
@310  = ~Yes, but also I am ready to do anything to win your love. If I were a court bard at Suzail and you were my queen, I would have been hanged, my dearest.~
@311  = ~But I am not a queen of Cormyr, Coran, I am a <CLASS> from Candlekeep and you are a rogue from Tethyr.~
@312  = ~I wish it were as easy for you to love me as it is for me to love you. If I were a court bard at Suzail and you were my queen, I would have been hanged, my dearest.~
@313  = ~While the knightling is too busy with things righteous and noble... I beg you to listen to the poor rogue's plea, my lady. For were I a slave...~
@314  = ~*Keep smiling and listening to what Coran has to say.*~
@315  = ~Because my first duty would have been to sing hymns of your beauty and grace, and I could not. My love for you would have left me speechless, for no bard has enough skill to sing of you. And I would have been the happiest man in Cormyr.~
@316  = ~Oh, Bloody Nine Hells, did you spend the whole day coming up with this nonsense?~
@317  = ~*laugh* Coran, this exposition does lead into the seduction phase, right?~
@318  = ~Coran, you could have been a court bard.~
@319  = ~If I were a queen, Coran, and you were a court bard, I would have been hanged alongside you... since infidelity to the King is treason.~
@320  = ~That's because I am rendered half witless by desire. Be mine tonight, sweetheart, and I swear that I will not utter a single word about geography, history or culture...~
@321  = ~Now, that's good old Coran for you. Absolutely not, my cute elf. Good night.~
@322  = ~Add math, biology of dragons, arcane arts, theology and alchemy to that list, and I am yours!~
@323  = ~*tremble in a cute way* Ah, Coran... *roll your eyes and announce dramatically* YES!~
@324  = ~On the other hand, you have not told me much about Tethyr. I think it is very important that I know you better, so maybe you can tell me of your childhood and life prior to meeting me? Kissing can wait.~
@325  = ~Indeed, and that is why it's not enough for me to gaze at your footwear, and why I cannot keep silent and be happy. I am rendered half witless by desire. Be mine tonight, sweetheart, and let the Mulhorandians and Cormyrians do what they will!~
@326  = ~I have no cure for doubts, I am afraid. Try a priest of Torm. Good night.~
@327  = ~*sigh* Because my first duty would have been to sing hymns to your beauty and grace, and I would not. My love for you would have rendered me speechless. For no bard has enough skill to sing of you. And I would have been the happiest man in Cormyr.~
@328  = ~Oh, Bloody Nine Hells, did you spend the whole day coming up with this nonsense?~
@329  = ~*smile and wait for him to continue*~
@330  = ~I guess I am talking nonsense, but it's because I am rendered halfwitless by desire. Be mine tonight, sweetheart, and let the Mulhorandians and Cormyrians gaze at footwear and swallow their tongues if that makes them happy!~
@331  = ~Erm... yes. I was going to tell you that I am rendered half-witless by desire. It's not enough for me to gaze at your footwear for I cannot keep silent and be happy. Be mine tonight, sweetheart, and let the Mulhorandians and Cormyrians do what they will!~
@332  = ~I do not want to be a court bard, sweetling, if that means remaining silent. Neither I can be happy just watching your footwear. I am rendered half witless by desire. Be mine tonight, sweetheart, and let the Mulhorandians and Cormyrians do what they will!~
@333  = ~Do we think alike then? My dear, infidelity cannot be complete without... actual infidelity. Look, I am rendered half-witless by desire. Be mine tonight, sweetheart, and let the Mulhorandians and Cormyrians gaze at footwear and swallow their tongues if that makes them happy!~
@334  = ~That's untrue. A clever plot can blacken a Queen's honor, even if she was perfectly true to her King. Politics, Coran-~
@335  = ~*sigh*~
@336  = ~*Nothing about *kiss* geography, *kiss* culture, *kiss* history, *kiss*, math, *kiss* biology of dragons, *kiss* arcane arts, *kiss* theology and *kiss* alchemy...~
@337  = ~By Hanali's Heart, I love decisive women!~
@338  = ~*grinds his teeth* I... I will tell you about Tethyr another time. We cannot cover the geography of all of Faerun in one night.~
@339  = ~How can something be over if it never began?~
@340  = ~*sigh* I am done talking... you may now stop watching me with that unchangeable expression of fascination.~
@341  = ~Hey, I am trying not to yawn here. It's the worst of your seduction stories ever!~
@342  = ~Coran, I was just waiting for a pause to tell you that it's over.~
@343  = ~Oh, good. I thought you'd never stop talking. Can we make love now?~
@344  = ~You have not been hammered on the head, have you? Oh well, good night.~
@345  = ~*A plump serving wench giggles over something Coran is whispering to her. Her hoop earrings dangle, and she presses her palm to her abundant bosom. "You've always been such a kidder, Master Coran!" she exclaims, but eagerly settles herself on Coran's lap. Coran wraps his arm around her waist, and an easy smile curves his lips. The elf shares a cup of wine with her, and licks a few spilled scarlet droplets from her skin. Suddenly he lifts his head and searches the common room with his gaze, frowning worriedly when he does not see you where he last left you. Coran suddenly gets up, and with a charming grin and quiet words he slips a few coins down the maid's bodice. Then he leaves, and the woman stares for a few moments after him, with a surprised expression on her face.*~
@346  = ~*You follow Coran to his room. The door is not locked, so you take a look inside.*~
@347  = ~*You spend the rest of the night drinking, brooding and giving dark looks to the plump wench.*~
@348  = ~*You take your leave of the common room and hit the sack. Love or not, this day was trying, and tomorrow is also likely to test you to your limits.*~
@349  = ~*A candle is burning on the table, and in its dancing light, Coran's elven features appear less sharp and he looks older, if that is at all possible for an ageless elf. Coran's hands lie on the table, palms facing up, and his dark slanted eyes are fixed on the twirling flame.*~
@350  = ~*Carefully you leave the room and close the door.*~
@351  = ~So, Coran sleeps alone tonight?~
@352  = ~*You walk quietly and cover Coran's eyes with your sleeve.* Guess who?~
@353  = ~*You walk over and blow out the candle.*~
@354  = ~*You hesitate in the doorway, watching Coran meditate.*~
@355  = ~Yes. Unless you'd share my cold blankets, <CHARNAME>. *sighs heavily* Do not expect me to apologize. I am not made of mithral! *smirks* Besides, it was you who showed up in my head, uninvited and bare-naked, and destroyed a perfectly nice fling.~
@356  = ~*stare at Coran with your mouth ajar*~
@357  = ~*start undoing the fasteners of your garment* Bare-naked you say? *sliding out of your clothes* Like this?~
@358  = ~Your sulking completes the illusion of a boy who missed a hoop with his stick. *snort* Good night.~
@359  = ~No, that doesn't sound really inviting with the mood you are in. As for the 'apology,' did you get one when I was flirting with that sailor? No, and you won't.~
@360  = ~Serves you right, but I don't recall asking you for an apology, Coran. I just came up here to see if you were alright. Obviously you are... so to speak. When you are in more of a mood to talk, or whatever... oh, never mind. Good night.~
@361  = ~Either in or out, sweetling. I have already missed out on a perfectly nice fling due to your uninvited, bare-naked appearance in my head. Must I not reverie now for your standing in the doorway in the flesh?~
@362  = ~*giggle* Really?~
@363  = ~*closing the door, you start undoing the fasteners of your garment* Bare-naked you say? *sliding out of your clothes* Like this?~
@364  = ~'Master Coran' seems a bit testy. *grinning at him* We'll talk more after this mood has passed. Seems we have been having similar thoughts about each other. Good night, Coran.~
@365  = ~Well, I am good at all sorts of things. Have you noticed that there are only two of us here... you are a woman, and I am a man... and I have already missed out on a perfectly nice fling due to your uninvited, bare-naked appearance in my head.~
@366  = ~Who would not notice that? And I am sure that if you went back downstairs, you could pick up right where you left off. *blow Coran a kiss and go back to your own room whistling a jolly song.*~
@367  = ~And maybe one day we will see if that holds true. But not right now, because I was not the woman you chose to be with first. Keep that in mind next time.~
@368  = ~Good... serves you right. I found out what I needed to know.~
@369  = ~Then you must be the continuation of the vivid visions that filled my head just when I was about to engage in a perfectly nice fling. Only you were much more... naked then.~
@370  = ~Your sulking completes the illusion of a boy who missed a hoop with his stick. *snort* Good night.~
@371  = ~Well, at least I now know I am not the only one having thoughts like that pop up at inopportune times. *wink at Coran* Something else for you to think about. Good night.~
@372  = ~No... *Coran shakes his head.* I am done with chasing dreams for tonight. I have already missed out on a perfectly nice fling due to your uninvited, bare-naked appearance in my head.~
@373  = ~Well, at least I now know I am not the only one having thoughts like that pop up at inopportune times. *wink at Coran* Something else for you to think about. Good night, my sweet elf.~

@377  = ~*You sit on the table-top by Coran, fold your arms under your breasts and look into his eyes.* So, Coran sleeps alone tonight?~
@378  = ~And you are Coran of Testiness. I think it would be best if we talk 'after' this mood of yours has passed. Good night, Coran.~
@379  = ~*A soft red glow appears around Coran's eyes.* I can see you in the dark as well as in the bright light, <CHARNAME>. *He makes a step towards you, intending to catch you in his arms.*~
@380  = ~*You move away fluidly, but make an inviting gesture with your hand.*~
@381  = ~*You dash for the door and shut it tight behind you. You stand for a moment, trying to catch your breath, and your heart pounds in your ears like mad. A hot flush rises to your cheeks. What might you have done, if you did not run away...*~
@382  = ~*You stand very still, mesmerized, then lift your own arms to meet Coran's palms with yours...*~
@383  = ~Oh, close your mouth and go sleep, child. I want a woman's love tonight, not a girls' adoration, no matter how sweet it is. You will understand when you grow up.~
@384  = ~Coran! That was uncalled for!~
@385  = ~I understand more than you are willing to admit right now. Maybe the 'elder elf' should find better ways of dealing with his... frustrations.~
@386  = ~Hold on right there, elf! Picking is one thing, but if you just want someone to insult because you're 'frustrated,' then go back to the wench downstairs. And if that's how you feel, then do not concern yourself with any chance of future 'adoration' from me.~
@387  = ~Right... Let us go, I'll walk you to your room. Tuck you into bed. Sing you a lullaby. *sighs* Oh, Hanali... what are you doing to me?~
@388  = ~*swallows hard* No... my imagination failed me, it seems. You are much more beautiful. I... I wonder if other aspects of my dreams will be significantly improved upon. Will you... erm... give me a point of comparison?~
@389  = ~Perhaps... but not tonight.~
@390  = ~*slowly and seductively* But of course...~
@391  = ~It will be beyond anything you can imagine, Coran. When I deem you a deserving accomplice.~
@392  = ~I... I do not know. I am not very... *You feel yourself blushing. Darn it all, but you should have lost your virginity *ages* ago!*~
@393  = ~Nope. *grinning at him as you dress...*  Our first time together is not going to be just a simple way for you to relieve some... frustration. I hope that I made it a little bit worse.~
@394  = ~*You kiss Coran passionately, pressing your hips firmly against him, then pull away and start dressing up.* Listen to me, Coran. I love you, but I will *not* lie with you, until I am the only one you want.~
@395  = ~*Coran's fingers stop a hair's breadth away from yours, and you can almost feel their warmth. Then they touch gently to your fingertips and slide between yours, intertwining. Coran looks down at your joined hands, and then he glances up at you. An unvoiced question is in his dark liquid eyes. Or perhaps their slant makes it into a plea...*~
@396  = ~*pull your hands from out of Coran's grasp* I am sorry...but not tonight.~
@397  = ~*slowly and seductively* Closer, elf, come closer...~

@406  = ~I am sorry. I should not have said that. *sighs* Oh, Hanali... what are you doing to me?~
@407  = ~You are, sweetling... It's just I started to doubt that you are still interested. *sighs* I'll keep my breeches laced, and my sheets cool. Oh, Hanali... what are you doing to me?~

@418  = ~I forgave you the moment you got up and went upstairs alone, Coran. I knew then that whatever you feel for me is stronger than your old habits.~
@419  = ~Shh... The other night has passed.~
@420  = ~Infidelity leaves a long memory, Coran. Things will never be the same between us.~
@421  = ~I do not have it in my heart to forgive you.~
@422  = ~Please, listen to me! Echtelion did it to preserve a special thing... even if the flower was one of many. I care not about flowers that much, but you...~
@423  = ~An old elf who taught us philosophy. And an avid gardener. What he said about the flower was: 'When you see something special it is natural to desire to preserve it.~
@424  = ~My interest right now lies in the most interesting subject I have ever encountered - you.~
@425  = ~If I was old Echtelion, I would have compared you to edelweiss - a flower that blooms far out of reach and is so very desirable. *bows*~
@426  = ~It passed, but I see its shadow in the corners of your eyes. I feel like a fool, and I will remember this sensation. My breath left me, when I looked down at the girl on my lap, and it was not you. I almost screamed in terror, as if someone tricked me. But there was no one to blame except myself for the fakery.~
@427  = ~Yes, but I do not know if they have changed for better or for worse. I feel like a fool, and I will remember this sensation. My breath left me, when I looked down at the girl on my lap, and it was not you. I almost screamed in terror, as if someone tricked me. But there was no one to blame except myself for the fakery.~
@428  = ~You wanted to hear about Tethyr, <CHARNAME>?~
@429  = ~It is near Calimshan, is it not?~
@430  = ~I wanted to hear, not so much about Tethyr itself, but about one of her sons. I know very little of you, Coran.~
@431  = ~You remember that?~
@432  = ~Yes, Tethyr borders on Amn and Calimshan, to the south of here. But, sweetling, it has not always been so. Only 19 millennia back, the great elven realm of Keltormir spanned over what is now Tethyr, Amn, Erlkazar and Calimshan.~
@433  = ~Of course. Ask an elf to tell you a bit about himself and he will start with the Crown Wars. I want to hear about you, Coran.~
@434  = ~*sigh* Keltormir fell some ten millennia ago, Coran, and I have been instructed in its history. I wish to know of someone who did not make it into the Candlekeep scrolls of ages. About you, Coran.~
@435  = ~That's quite... large. Whatever happened that it became but a patch of greenery betwixt the human Empires built on the sand?~
@436  = ~Skip right to Tethir the Dragonslayer, Coran. I'd like a tale about the great hero of old!~
@437  = ~Forget it. I've grown bored with it already.~
@438  = ~I was born in the Forest of Tethyr, in the midst of the elven lands, in the year eleven hundred and something in Dale reckoning.~
@439  = ~Wait, wait, which year?~
@440  = ~At moments like this, I am almost happy that I have no relatives, because nobody is going to tell me the inevitable: 'He is old enough to be your *father*, <CHARNAME>!' ~
@441  = ~So, you were born. Did this event have any notable consequences?~
@442  = ~Nothing has transpired to cloud my memory, <CHARNAME>. The Forest of Tethyr was once a part of the ancient elven realm of Keltormir. It spanned over what is now Tethyr, Amn, Erlkazar and Calimshan.~
@443  = ~Of course. Ask an elf to tell you a bit about himself and he will start with the Crown Wars. I want to hear about you, Coran.~
@444  = ~An unworthy descendant of the wood and moon elves of Keltormir, of which I shall not speak any further, I was born in the Forest of Tethyr in the year eleven hundred and something in Dale Reckoning.~
@445  = ~Ever heard of the Flights of the Dragons, sweetling? I think you are too young to remember the one of that year... but it's a rather terrible and beautiful thing, when the dragons herd together and roam around burning and plundering. In one such event, 10 millennia ago, the red dragons destroyed much of my kin and desecrated Keltormir. Three woods now keep the memories of its former glory: The Wyrmwood, the Forest of Mir and the Forest of Tethyr.~
@446  = ~Darling, if you don't shut me up with a kiss, I'll start complaining about greedy humans taking elven lands next.~
@447  = ~Oh, Coran, please do... It's so... elven. Almost like dancing naked in the moonlight.~
@448  = ~Here is your kiss, and indeed, that's enough about the Forest of Tethyr. Let's switch to more recent histories. I know very little about you, Coran.~
@449  = ~Tethir was kin to Keltormir and a mighty warrior, tall and proud. A star shone on his brow, and when he wielded his mighty long sword, the fair folk fainted with awe. In the year 11700 before Dale Reckoning, mighty Tethir had slain, in single combat, two ancient reds. The dragons everywhere were truly impressed, and agreed that elves are not just a source of tasty meat, but can serve for battle practice, as well.~
@450  = ~*laugh* Now, that's one version of the tale Tethir would have loved to hear.~
@451  = ~You, on the other hand, do not sound too impressed.~
@452  = ~I would have preferred to hear the tale in the true bardic tradition.~
@453  = ~Great man. I bet you went adventuring because of him.~
@454  = ~Ah, the next battle is only a few minutes away, <CHARNAME>. Then we'll not have time to be bored.~
@455  = ~How do you know? Did you betray me, and the ambush is waiting ahead?~
@456  = ~Yep.~
@457  = ~You wish. I bet we will wander around aimlessly for hours, encountering nothing but a minor skirmish.~
@458  = ~The year eleven hundred and eighty five. *sighs*~
@459  = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, the Year of the Immoral Imp.~
@460  = ~*giggle* How very fitting!~
@461  = ~I presume you left your homeland after a while?~
@462  = ~Go on.~
@463  = ~I understand. I am not an avid listener of my elders myself. That's why I left the Forest of Tethyr and the conversations of elven destiny, glorious past and evil humans. I thought it would be a grand adventure to see the world of N'Tel'Quess.~
@464  = ~I could not have picked a better time to face the humans' wrath. At that time, the royal family of Tethyr started the persecutions of Tel'Quessir.~
@465  = ~But why?~
@466  = ~I am sure it was all fun and games to you.~
@467  = ~Well, I think I can imagine the rest of your 'adventures.' Hiding around, being sheltered by women, stealing... *sigh* I think I'd rather hear about Tethir the Dragonslayer, Coran.~
@468  = ~N'Tel'Quess... Non-people. I do not think you are *that* different from the rest of your kin, Coran.~
@469  = ~I did not reshape the Realms, and my deeds were left unsung. But perhaps, it shall change one day, <CHARNAME>. I admit that I am much more curious about N'Tel'Quess and their world, than many of my kin. That's why I left the Forest of Tethyr and the conversations of elven destiny, the glorious past, and evil humans. I thought it would be an adventure to come across humans and see for myself.~
@470  = ~I could not have picked a better time to face the humans' wrath. At that time, the royal family of Tethyr had started the persecutions of Tel'Quessir.~
@471  = ~N'Tel'Quess... Non-people. I do not think you are *that* different from the rest of your kin, Coran.~
@472  = ~Ah, yes, complaining about humans - the pride part of elven heritage. For me, however, human females always compensated for the shortfalls of the race... and I did face human wrath, sweetling. I left the elven lands right at the time the royal family of Tethyr started the persecutions of Tel'Quessir. Still, it is a grand adventure, and the more I learn, the more I grow curious of N'Tel'Quess and their world.~
@473  = ~Why would someone persecute the elves?~
@474  = ~Ah, where would the male human be without the female of the race?~
@475  = ~Tethir was the first elf to kill a dragon, and only a person who isn't too serious about all that has been done before him can do something new. I am sure he was an adventurous sort, and we'd all get along with him famously.~
@476  = ~Not impressed? I am envious, sweetling. I missed my chance to equal Tethir the last time I saw a wyrm. It was during the last dragon flight in the Year of the Wyrm, and I was... ahem... just leaving Westgate... secretly. And there it was, the black dragon Xuntlarmerphyn, rushing across the night sky. So I shot an arrow or two into it, but it was too high and too fast. But, if your luck does not run out, we will come across one sooner or later.~
@477  = ~I cannot tell it proper on the march, sweetling. My heart will go into the chanting, and I will lose sight of everything else. A fireball could explode under my feet, and I would not notice 'til I was aflame.~
@478  = ~Besides, it should be told where it was written - under the canopy of the Forest of Tethyr.~
@479  = ~Now, let us both look out for the foes that are sure to attack us in the next few minutes.~
@480  = ~In truth, I left the Forest of Tethyr because I had heard way too much of elven destiny, the glorious past, and evil humans. I thought it would be a grand adventure to see the world of N'Tel'Quess.~
@481  = ~Do you really think I could betray you, <CHARNAME>? But the way your luck goes, we always run into enemies when least expected. I imagine that we'll bump into a raving red dragon sooner or later.~
@482  = ~So, you find it exciting when the danger keeps you on your toes... Interesting.~
@483  = ~It's just that there are many more xvarts, orcs and goblins out here than dragons... but don't lose hope. We'll meet a ravaging red wyrm one day, I am sure of it, and my arrows will sing 'The Death of the Dragon' for you.~
@484  = ~Great, I can already see that you will find common ground with my lady mother.~
@485  = ~Indeed, I left the Forest of Tethyr because I had heard way too much  of elven destiny, the glorious past, and evil humans. I thought it would be a grand adventure to see the world of N'Tel'Quess. I could not have picked a better time to face the humans' wrath.~
@486  = ~At that time, the royal family of Tethyr had started the persecutions of Tel'Quessir.~
@487  = ~King Errilam managed to get himself killed in a hunting accident. Unfortunately, he was hunting with elven friends. This was reason enough for his nephew to start cutting down the forest and killing any elves found on human lands.~
@488  = ~I am sorry to hear that, Coran. You must have had hard times.~
@489  = ~Was that when you acquired your roguish skills?~
@490  = ~Well, to put it bluntly, I am bored, Coran.~
@491  = ~Yes... yes, of course, fun and games. It was one big joke, when Alemander gave the order to cut down the trees in the Forest of Tethyr and kill any elves on human lands.~
@492  = ~Sweetling... you do know that it is not a belittling term, don't you? It only means people who are not physically and spiritually connected to each other and the Weave, the way Tel'Quessir are... Sweetling?~
@493  = ~The same place the males of any race would be - not having been born into this world. Even if, by some sorcery, it were possible, I would not want to be born.~
@494  = ~I lived, my gentle friend. But... thank you for caring.~
@495  = ~Ah, one does not become a rogue, sweetling, one is born into the profession. However, I did a lot of running and hiding back then, and buying was all but impossible, so...~
@496  = ~*smile* Sweetling, there has yet to be a woman who can quell the desire to push a man's hair out of his eyes. You cannot resist it. There is something fatalistic and poignant about it.~
@497  = ~*smirk* I am not such a woman, Coran. You can go around with your hair falling into your eyes all day. By the way, it does not become you in the least.~
@498  = ~And I am but a woman. *You move the runaway strand of hair and notice a small scar at Coran's right temple.*~
@499  = ~It is called maternal instinct, elf. Do you like being mothered?~
@500  = ~*smile* whatever you say, handsome. *You gently blow at the runaway strand of hair and kiss Coran's temple. Your lips brush against an uneven mark on his smooth elven skin. There is a small scar at Coran's right temple.*~
@501  = ~In all things you are exceptional, my love. *With a sigh Coran brushes the hair away from his eyes, and you notice a small scar at Coran's right temple.*~
@502  = ~What's the deal with that scar? Run out of salves once?~
@503  = ~Oh, I think I just relinquished yet another misconception about elves. You know how they say: "He heals like an elf?"~
@504  = ~There is what looks like an old scar at your temple, Coran. Were you hurt so badly, my poor dear, that the healer missed it?~
@505  = ~*shake your head in disapproval* Who healed that, a kobold witch doctor? I do not know what I can do *now*, but if I had been there, you'd have forgotten that you ever had that scratch!~
@506  = ~Let us go, Coran, before we hear suggestive jokes from the rest of the company.~
@507  = ~*Coran catches your hand and kisses your palm.* What's wrong, joy of my heart?~
@508  = ~You, my mother? Ah, no. Then it would be entirely inappropriate of me to have those wonderful daydreams about you standing bare in a pool of moonlight. *With a sigh Coran brushes the hair away from his eyes and you notice a small scar at Coran's right temple.*~
@509  = ~*Coran promptly wraps his arm around your waist and presses his cheek against yours.* What's wrong, my warm wind?~
@510  = ~*touches the scar lightly* No...I wanted it left unhealed. It's a long story, <CHARNAME>.~
@511  = ~I wish to hear it.~
@512  = ~*smile* Let me guess. A woman got you into trouble?~
@513  = ~Woe is me, for we do not have time for long stories. Let's be on our way, lest we hear no end of suggestive jokes.~
@514  = ~Make it a short one, and I will listen.~
@515  = ~Some of them are not bad, actually. That one about swords and daggers left under cloaks, for example... but sweetling, one does not have to be a paladin to wield a greatsword.~
@516  = ~It happened when I just left the Forest of Tethyr in an attempt to see the wide world. Unfortunately, shortly after I came to human lands, King Errilam died during a hunting trip with his elven friends, and his successor found it reason enough to start repressing my kin.~
@517  = ~There was nothing to be done about it, but dive into the shadows. In the underworld people rarely ask you to remove your cowl, before dealing with you.~
@518  = ~Sooo... Did someone betray you and you managed a hair-raising escape with an elven maiden who was a paragon of beauty and virtue, and royal to boot?~
@519  = ~Yes, that's true.~
@520  = ~Erm, Coran, it sounds like one of those boring stories about poor oppressed people. Cut it short.~
@521  = ~I am sorry, Coran... Erm... Gotta go!~
@522  = ~No. A woman saved me from death.~
@523  = ~I got hurt when trying to steal from a merchant's house. The merchant's wife felt pity for me, though, and healed me instead of surrendering me to the authorities. She stayed faithful to her ever-absent and crude husband, despite my fervor. So I kept the scar to remind myself that there are things that women value above passion.~
@524  = ~And men...perhaps men do, too.~
@525  = ~Ewww. Do not tell me you were in love, for the first time, at that.~
@526  = ~Good story. And short in telling. Time to go!~
@527  = ~No, I have never become that familiar with Queen Ellesime.~
@528  = ~I would be lying if I said that I did not enjoy this dangerous existence... but back to the scar.~
@529  = ~I broke into a merchant's house one night and set to opening a coffer. The lock did not look too complicated, but when I opened the lid, two tentacles sprung into my face, each armed with a poisonous spike. It stung me, and I lost control of my muscles, trashing about like a leaf in the wind.~
@530  = ~Ewww! What in the Nine Hells was it? And how did this thing end up in the chest?~
@531  = ~Nasty trap...~
@532  = ~So?~
@533  = ~Then let us go.~
@534  = ~No, sweetling... you do not understand...~
@535  = ~*quietly* That was the question I asked myself, sweetling.~
@536  = ~And? Are love, duty, faithfulness and devotion important?~
@537  = ~Well, at least you thought about it, before yelling 'NO!' ~
@538  = ~Right. While you are pondering about the answer, let us catch up with the others, lest we hear no end of suggestive jokes.~
@539  = ~First time I was in love, I was barely thirty, sweetling. Let us go.~
@540  = ~Apparently, I was not as good a thief as I had imagined. It was a whipsting, a beastie which Tethyrian and Amnish merchants oft lock with the treasure to ward off rogues.~
@541  = ~Interesting. I am glad we are in Baldur's Gate. Antidote is expensive nowadays.~
@542  = ~Now... that's *outrageous*! As a rogue, I protest against such an inhumane practice!~
@543  = ~What happened next?~
@544  = ~With all the noise I was making, the lady of the house awoke and came running in with a couple of maids. A vile elf caught stealing... If she'd called for guards, I would have been lucky to lose only a hand. She did not, though. Instead, Belena tended me and would not hear of me leaving until I, as she put it, would be out of danger and properly fed.~
@545  = ~I guess you were not much to look at as a youngster?~
@546  = ~*laugh* So much for lithe elven beauty.~
@547  = ~I knew there was a woman involved somewhere! I can imagine how it ended. Let's just go.~
@548  = ~And the scar?~
@549  = ~*smiles quizzically* You are not the only one who can play the game of no-s and maybe-s, <CHARNAME>.~
@550  = ~Did I now?~
@551  = ~*snicker* Belena had never seen an elf up close before.~
@552  = ~I am getting to that.~
@553  = ~I...I fell for her with all the fervor of my youth, <CHARNAME>. I knew that she also fancied me, but stayed faithful to her ever-absent and crude husband, despite my advances. So I kept the scar to remind myself that there are things that women value over passion.~
@554  = ~And men... perhaps men do, too.~
@555  = ~My dearest, the heavenly curve of your neck makes me think about kissing it. *sigh* Alas, it's not a good time. Hmmm... did I tell you how I'd stolen a locket from Cattie-Brie Battlehammer's own neck?~
@556  = ~And who is this Cattie-Brie Battlehammer? *Another* old flame of yours?~
@557  = ~Stealing from Cattie-Brie! You should be ashamed of yourself. Next you will be talking about nicking Twinkle.~
@558  = ~Right, and took her maidenhead to boot.~
@559  = ~How did you do it, trickster?~
@560  = ~By the Golden Rose, no! I am not into... rowdy types. Cattie-Brie is an adventuress of some renown in Drizzt's company. Perhaps Candlekeep monks do not concern themselves with local heroes, but they were quite famous in Waterdeep in the time I lived there. Fighting pirates, if I recall correctly. And I had just met a beautiful wizard's apprentice...~
@561  = ~I knew it! Coran, do you have a single story that does not involve a woman?~
@562  = ~Wait! I did not say that I wanted to hear your story! I do not!~
@563  = ~Ah... *that* Cattie-Brie. You should be ashamed of yourself. Next you will be nicking Twinkle.~
@564  = ~I was tempted, but for the name.~
@565  = ~Are you mistaking me for a collector of antiquities? I'll leave this pleasure to Drizzt.~
@566  = ~To start from the beginning...~
@567  = ~Of course I have. Thousands of them, but this one does.~
@568  = ~To start from the beginning, I met a beautiful wizard's apprentice and she told me that there was a thing she'd like to have, but her money couldn't buy.~
@569  = ~Needless to say, I immediately boasted that I could get it for her. To my surprise, Allana wanted Cattie-Brie's small locket. She said that the locket had a peculiar minor enchantment that she wanted to study, but Cattie-Brie would not sell it. I found Cattie-Brie in a small inn Allana said they frequented, and managed to strike a conversation with her.~
@570  = ~Go on...~
@571  = ~I am sorry, Coran. I have no time for this.~
@572  = ~Oh, back to watching the nape of your neck, then. *sighs*~
@573  = ~As it happened, I met a beautiful wizard's apprentice, and she told me that there was a thing she'd like to have, but her money couldn't buy.~
@574  = ~Needless to say, I immediately boasted that I could get it for her. To my surprise, Allana wanted Cattie-Brie's small locket. She said that the locket had a peculiar minor enchantment placed on it that she wanted to study, but Cattie-Brie would not sell it. I found Cattie-Brie in a small inn Allana said they frequented, and managed to strike up a conversation with her.~
@575  = ~Coran, have you ever told a story which did not revolve around women? Just curious.~
@576  = ~Well... frankly, not many. But I bet, you will be pleased with the ending of this one!~
@577  = ~So there we were, arguing about Cattie's magical bow - Taulmaril. After I saw her drink at least two mugs of ale, I quite placidly mentioned that, with my Whisperer, I could hit the mark no worse than herself. Redheads being redheads, she flared up like a firecracker and challenged me to make good on my word.~
@578  = ~Taulmaril... mmm... nice.~
@579  = ~No wonder. I would, too, in her place! You are not *that* attractive, you know.~
@580  = ~Erm... Coran, can you tell it to someone else? That is, if you absolutely have to tell it.~
@581  = ~You must be kidding!~
@582  = ~Yes, a wonderful bow. But I made Whisperer, and I knew that with it, I stood a chance against Taulmaril. Long bows are more accurate, sweetling.~
@583  = ~But you like me! Your questionable taste in men aside, we shot three arrows each, quite well, and then I boasted that I could hit a golden coin at three hundred paces.~
@584  = ~While she dug into her pockets, she realized her money pouch was missing. She reasoned that she left it in the inn. I turned my money belt upside down with the same result.~
@585  = ~I suggested my belt buckle, but could a modest woman allow a man to shoot with his breaches down? Cattie-Brie gave me her locket even before I slipped it into the argument. I asked her to stay in place while I counted the paces... and, with the locket in my hand, I started walking towards the nearest tree grove.~
@586  = ~At two hundred paces I broke into a run.~
@587  = ~Note to self: do something about my taste in men. Later.~
@588  = ~You sly fox! I bet you were just out of Taulmaril's range, too!~
@589  = ~I should not really laugh at someone being mugged, but it's just too funny! Terrible, but funny!~
@590  = ~Whatever would you have done, if Cattie-Brie's money pouch had not gone missing? What a lucky coincidence!~
@591  = ~*cringe* Coran, you are such a bastard, you know?~
@592  = ~I might... though it was meant for your ears.~
@593  = ~No. I swear by Hanali's Golden Rose, it's a true story!~
@594  = ~Much, much later.~
@595  = ~*smile* Speaking of bad taste, mine was worse back then. The enchantment on the locket was a peculiar one. It became warmer to the touch when Drizzt himself came near.~
@596  = ~My wizardess never studied it. She just used it to aid her in stalking Drizzt, all starry-eyed and sighing enough for a dozen Ilmater priests. I doubt Allana even remembered my name, once she got her hands on the thing.~
@597  = ~*shrug* I was so blind!~
@598  = ~I thought so. My... erm... hip still has a scar, sweetling, as I miscalculated the range of that bow of hers a tiny bit... it's a good bow, that Taulmaril, very good.~
@599  = ~Oh, I am sure your tender wizardess rewarded you for that scratch with a night of broiling passion.~
@600  = ~Are you finished talking yet? We have killing to do.~
@601  = ~I wish you had somehow nicked Taulmaril, not the stupid locket. Well, next time, maybe.~
@602  = ~If it is any consolation to you, my... erm... hip still has a scar, as I miscalculated the range of that bow of hers a tiny bit... it's a good bow, that Taulmaril, very good.~
@603  = ~*A smug smile appears on Coran's face for some reason.* A very lucky turn of events. Unfortunately, the luck almost did run out - my... erm... hip still has a scar, sweetling, as I miscalculated the range of that bow of hers a tiny bit... it's a good bow, that Taulmaril, very good.~
@604  = ~We shot three arrows each, quite well, and then I boasted to her that I could hit a golden coin at three hundred paces.~
@605  = ~Whatever would you have done if Cattie-Brie's money pouch had not gone missing? What a lucky coincidence!~
@606  = ~Alas, sweetling, that was one case when a robbery did not pay.~
@607  = ~The enchantment on the locket was a peculiar one. It became warmer to the touch when Drizzt himself came near. My wizardess never studied it. She just used it to aid her in stalking Drizzt, all starry-eyed and sighing enough for a dozen Ilmater priests. I doubt Allana even remembered my name, once she got her hands on the thing.~
@608  = ~Ah, back to killing then. Set the target, ma'am.~
@609  = ~You do not know just how right you are! I *should* have stolen the bow, not that awful golden medallion!~
@610  = ~Sweetling, ever since I told you of my misadventure with the lute, I fear that your heart has cooled toward me. I have reasoned a way to ease your doubts and display my prowess...~
@611  = ~Coran, I would not care if you could not tell a lute from a flute. But to tell *me* of seeking another woman's favor with such fervor was a turn off for sure!~
@612  = ~Oh, do not worry. It's enough that *one* of us can play decent music.~
@613  = ~What are you talking about? It was a funny story, and it endeared you to me! I would be bored with a lover who is perfect in every aspect and could do just about anything!~
@614  = ~So, what's your cunning plan?~
@615  = ~Sweetling, jealousy of the past is the poison slipped in the wine of the present to kill the future. Look, I loved her many days ago, and now I love you.~
@616  = ~And one day, someone whispering into your ear will be jealous of me. Such is life. Now, what was your cunning plan?~
@617  = ~Coran, I do not want to talk about love. Least of all with someone who has no idea about the concept.~
@618  = ~Sometimes, talking to you reminds me of the old saying that 'love and hate are only a step apart'.~
@619  = ~Of course, those of my kin who can actually sing, sing a capella and would not sing in non-elven lands. I am only a rogue, and not a proper bard, so I can lighten your heart with a song without fear of creating an unbearable longing for my music in your heart... I find it funny that my kin shows so much concern for the N'Tel'Quess' state of mind in that matter, but tradition is tradition.~
@620  = ~Perhaps it is a secret weapon of your people... when all Elves leave for Evermeet, a bunch of elven bards will stay behind for a time, travelling these lands, singing and inflicting that longing in the hearts of all. Then we poor N'Tel'Quess, will forever miss the pointy-eared race and their legacy.~
@621  = ~Have not you heard? The bards are our secret weapon. When our kin leaves for Evermeet, they will stay behind for a time, travelling these lands, singing and inflicting longing in the hearts of the poor N'Tel'Quess. Thus, they will be destined to forever miss our race and our legacy.~
@622  = ~I've heard your singing before. It is pleasing enough, Coran. So the cunning plan is a song, which will make my soul wrap tightly and then fall apart, trembling and tender?~
@623  = ~Oh, quit babbling already and start singing!~
@624  = ~Coran, I am in no mood for music. Good night.~
@625  = ~You are a diamond among the glass beads, <CHARNAME>. But I'd like to restore your confidence in me as a lute player by offering you a ballad... and a hint.~
@626  = ~I wish to restore your confidence in me as a lute player by offering you a ballad... and a hint.~
@627  = ~Then you will never talk about love with anyone, heart of my heart.~
@628  = ~Sayings are dusty things thrown away by our elders. Why do we even bother picking them up? Reason for yourself, sweetling, but if you ask me, there is a great distance between the two.~
@629  = ~Ah, I never wanted to be missed, once I am gone. Missing is... such a gray thing, like a mist of some sort. Please, do not ever miss me, sweetling.~
@630  = ~Of course I would not, silly. I will have someone else to whisper gentle nonsense into my ear.~
@631  = ~I cannot promise that.~
@632  = ~Coran... *sigh* just sing me your song, elf.~
@633  = ~Yes, my good lady. Now, I think I tuned it just right. <CHARNAME>, allow me to sing you the 'Ballad of the Sea-Elf King's Daughter'.~
@634  = ~Oh... you look way too serious, love. Here, I must finally put this darn lute to use. Now, I think I tuned it just right. <CHARNAME>, allow me to sing you the 'Ballad of the Sea-Elf King's Daughter'.~
@635  = ~Maybe it's for the best. *plucks few strings which produces a heartbreaking effect* Good night, sweetling.~
@636  = ~I am glad that you honor my request. *bows mockingly and plucks few strings which produces a heartbreaking effect* Good night, sweetling.~
@637  = ~Wait! What about the song you were going to sing for me?~
@638  = ~It's what you wanted to hear, is it not?~
@639  = ~Good night, darling. Sleep well... and see me in your dreams. *lean over to Coran to give him a kiss on the cheek*~
@640  = ~Yes. Yes of course.~
@641  = ~*sigh* You know that I will. Gods be good, woman, are you shrewd or nave?~
@642  = ~Song? Oh, yes a song! Here, I can finally put this darn lute to use. Now, I think I tuned it just right. <CHARNAME>, allow me to sing you the 'Ballad of the Sea-Elf King's Daughter'.~
@643  = ~One fair day on Dragonmere, 
A fisherman had little luck
'My nets are empty,' he'd said,
and sighed and pulled it out.
Indeed his catch was only one,
but 'twas not a fish or a squid
'Twas a beauty, seaweed clad,
A daughter to the Sea-elf King.~
@644  = ~The King hath given him his word -
Three wishes he shall grant
For setting his beautiful daughter
Free, for her honor and for her life.
The fisherman wished for his nets to fill,
Then he wished for a chest of pearls
Third, he asked for a hundred jewels
From the crown of the Sea-elf Lord.~
@645  = ~The man's three wishes all came true
The Elfking suited his own words
But the Human said - 'I am no fool,
'Twas dowry, my good Lord.
I will take your daughter ashore,
Ashore of azure Dragonmere,
For I have come to love her, Sir,
And she is a maiden most fair... '~
@646  = ~The Sea-king then laughed:
'Betwixt fools, you're the worst,
For you had my daughter's love,
And now her heart you've lost.
Remember, Human, that Elven love,
Amongst all wishes, comes the first.
If you'd asked for her hand at once,
You'd have a wife by your hearth.'~
@647  = ~*Coran touches your hand.* Remember, sweetling, that when I look at you, I have but one wish. Good night.~
@648  = ~I am lovesick, <CHARNAME>. I should have been smarter, I should not have let it take me over so completely, but I recognize the symptoms all too well. You look away - and I am saddened, you smile at something I have said- and I am pleased beyond belief. I crave to tell you time and again how much I love you and how much I want you.~
@649  = ~Yet I hear 'no' from you all the time.~
@650  = ~I made a wish, which only you can fulfill - a night of passion. How about we exchange wishes? Being a man of honor, I will give you yours first. I only hope you make it something I can carry out while the night is still young.~
@651  = ~A night with me cannot be bought or obtained in exchange for something, elf.~
@652  = ~Luckily, you can give me my wish while fulfilling yours... let us be lovers tonight...erm... Is everyone asleep?~
@653  = ~Luckily, you can give me my wish while fulfilling yours... let us be lovers tonight... erm... Is everyone asleep?~
@654  = ~A moon from the sky will suffice. Give it to me, Coran, and I am - yours.~
@655  = ~Yet you allowed me to be with you but once... It makes me dizzy to remember your loving.~
@656  = ~I made a wish, which only you can fulfill - another night of passion. At least one more! How about we exchange wishes? Being a man of honor, I will give you yours first. I only hope you make it something I can carry out while the night is still young.~
@657  = ~Luckily, you can give me my wish while fulfilling yours... let us be lovers tonight... erm... Is everyone asleep?~
@658  = ~You must want it to be stolen then! O-la-la, I did not suspected that you liked that sort of game! Right. Go to sleep now, sweetling, and one of these nights, I shall steal a horse, come riding in, tie you up, and off we shall go into the night!~
@659  = ~Idiot!~
@660  = ~Lovely. You know what? Just get me the moon from the sky, and I will love you so passionately that the sunrise will look grey to you.~
@661  = ~*laugh* I will cut your throat if you do anything like that!~
@662  = ~How about we ride off now... *blush* without horses, if you get my meaning. Erm... is everyone asleep?~
@663  = ~How about we ride off now... *blush* without horses, if you get my meaning. Erm... is everyone asleep?~
@664  = ~*A chorus of familiar voices answers: 'YES!', and random giggling fills the air.*~
@665  = ~Give me your hand, <CHARNAME>... get up... good, good. Now, let's *run*!~
@666  = ~Are you serious- Oh, Hell's Fire! Not so fast, I am not a... light-footed el...~
@667  = ~Running under the stars with a warm night wind caressing our faces... what more can one wish?~
@668  = ~You are insane, I swear you are! What are we going to tell the others when we return tomorrow?~
@669  = ~I am not *running* away with you!~
@670  = ~A moon from the sky... that moon over there?~
@671  = ~But sunrises already look grey to me compared to the blush on your cheeks... so, you want a moon. From the sky. That moon over there?~
@672  = ~The round pale thing? Are you sure you do not want a lovely moonstone necklace?~
@673  = ~You know what? I do not need anything. I... I see how much you love me, and I... I want us to be lovers tonight... erm... is everyone asleep?~
@674  = ~You know what? I do not need anything. I... I see how much you love me, and I... I want us to be lovers tonight... erm... is everyone asleep?~
@675  = ~Yes, Coran, that moon. Good night.~
@676  = ~A necklace... yes, let it be a necklace of pale moonstones... with sapphire stars... and enameled clouds... set with diamonds... Coran, you do not have such a thing with you right now, do you?~
@677  = ~Were you born an idiot, or do you just pretend to be one?~
@678  = ~You do not like horses? I can make it an eagle... but you will have to wait until I travel to Evereska and back. They have the best riding eagles in Evereska.~
@679  = ~No, it is not the horse part of your plan that I object to. It's the 'Coran stealing <CHARNAME>' thing that does not sit well with me.~
@680  = ~I... I have a wish for you. A task not so arduous for a man who boasts that he can steal one of the eagles that patrol Evereska. Get me the moon from the sky, and I will love you so passionately that the sunrise will look grey to you.~
@681  = ~I just think that you are an idiot.~
@682  = ~Sure, bring an eagle. I can wait.~
@683  = ~*sigh* Allow me to tell you, <CHARNAME>, that you have the strangest sense of humor. A dangerous sort, and I am not amused.~
@684  = ~There is no need to run further, a'maelamin. Not from curious eyes, nor from your own heart... Please... the grass is like silk here, and the silence will allow us to hear every sigh, every caress and every-~
@685  = ~Tula sinome, Coran. Is that... correct? I meant to say 'come here' in Elvish... erm, I hope I did not ask you to pour soup or something.~
@686  = ~Then let's sigh, and caress and listen - the time for words had passed.~
@687  = ~I do not know what madness came over me. I am returning to the camp. Linger here, if you wish.~
@688  = ~A man... and a woman can wish for many more things than running through the night together. I... I can show you... A'maelamin, the grass is like silk, and the silence will allow us to hear every sigh, every caress and every-~
@689  = ~Ed' i'ear ar' elenea! Dina ar' tula sinome, Coran. (By the sea and stars! Be silent and come here, Coran.)~
@690  = ~Does it matter tonight? Let tomorrow find its own answers. Here and now... the grass is like silk, and the silence will allow us to hear every sigh, every caress and every-~
@691  = ~I'll need some time to come up with something... oh, wait! Stay where you are... I'll be right back!~
@692  = ~*Coran rushes away and returns with something which looks like a bucket dripping with water.*~
@693  = ~Here, look inside - I brought you the moon and three stars, to boot.~
@694  = ~*The vessel Coran brought is full of water, and a piece of the night sky is reflected in it... including the moon.*~
@695  = ~*You take the thing from Coran and pour the water out.* Where is it? I do not see it. You tricked me, thief.~
@696  = ~By the gods, Coran... you did bring me the moon from the sky. You do love me, don't you? I... I want us to be lovers tonight... erm... is everyone asleep?~
@697  = ~By the gods, Coran... you did bring me the moon from the sky. You do love me, don't you? I... I want us to be lovers tonight... erm... is everyone asleep?~
@698  = ~I do not recall asking for the stars. Once you have the moon only-~
@699  = ~Is it... is that my helmet? It's going to rust! Dry it out immediately!~
@700  = ~Oh my... it is... it is... a... helmet full of water with a reflection of the moon inside. We had better dry it out before it rusts. Otherwise, the owner will not be very happy tomorrow.~
@701  = ~Actually, I do... See, those are moonstones and little clouds covered with diamond dust and sapphire stars, just like you wanted... Let me put it about your neck - beautiful!~
@702  = ~Coran, Coran... I do not know what to say... except: I love you and I want to be your lover tonight... erm... is everyone asleep?~
@703  = ~Nice trinket. But who said I have to keep my word?~
@704  = ~Don't take your hands away Coran... Hold me close and - oh, did someone just... giggle?~
@705  = ~Nice trinket. But who said I have to keep my word?~
@706  = ~Got it. No horses, no eagles, no stealing <CHARNAME>, and not tonight or any other night.~
@707  = ~Well, I'll be leaving then. Of course, I will need my gear, since the road is difficult and long. Expect me in a few months time on the eagle back. *kisses <CHARNAME>* Good bye.~
@708  = ~It was perfect. *Coran whispers some sweet gibberish in Elvish and lowers you onto the bed layered with grasses, fallen leaves and wild flowers. For all you know he is talking about soup... or wine... or love.*~
@709  = ~The sighs are unspoken words, sweetling, and I will teach you every tender word a man can say to a woman in such a way. *Coran lowers you onto the bed layered with grasses, fallen leaves and wild flowers.*~
@710  = ~Madness?!~
@711  = ~*Without a single word, Coran lowers you onto the bed layered with grasses, fallen leaves and wild flowers.*~
@712  = ~Can you not see? Then you are blind, <CHARNAME>.~
@713  = ~I could have waited for a cloud to come and hide the stars... but I did not want to. I am tired, <CHARNAME>. Good night.~
@714  = ~Indeed. If you do not love me, neither moon, nor necklace, nor palace will suffice.~
@715  = ~I bring her the moon and the stars and she is worried about rust!~
@716  = ~*sighs* Women...~
@717  = ~Yes I do. The condition of the fighting gear is very important to me. Our lives depend on it.~
@718  = ~I am sorry... I am embarrassed and speak nonsense. You did bring me the moon from the sky. You do love me, don't you? I... I want us to be lovers tonight... erm... is everyone asleep?~
@719  = ~Yes, I can see that. Makes me wonder what my place is among your priorities? Tenth? Twentieth? Oh, do not bother to reply.~
@720  = ~*You wake up in Coran's embrace. The elf cups your breast with the easy manner of a man who has caressed many women, and says thoughtfully:* I was born far away from the oceans, and yet I love them as much as the mighty forests or great mountains. Perhaps even more so, because of the feeling of freedom... It is a paradox, because, unless you are of the sea-kin, a fish or kelp, you should feel constrained by the deadly vastness of water.~
@721  = ~Hmm... the last time I looked in the mirror, I did not see a fish, nor a sea-elf, nor seaweed. Perhaps, <RACE>s are also unconstrained by the oceans...~
@722  = ~Hmm...the last time I looked in the mirror, I did not see a fish, nor a sea-elf, nor seaweed. Perhaps, <RACE>s are also unconstrained by the oceans...~
@723  = ~It's cold, green, salty and wavy. *shrug* And yeah, it's awfully big. So?~
@724  = ~Often I listened to the voice of the sea behind the tall walls of Candlekeep and dreamed of a ship with white sails, taking me far away.~
@725  = ~*smile* Peculiar, indeed.~
@726  = ~*grin* I can make a sea-elf out of you easily enough! Can you swim?~
@727  = ~Gods be good, why are you talking about oceans, Coran?!~
@728  = ~You are no ordinary <RACE>, godsblood, and I doubt that anything can restrain your spirit. Of late though, I found that another thing affects me in the same self-contradictory way as the ocean.~
@729  = ~And what thing would that be?~
@730  = ~I am not interested in listening to your soul-delving expositions.~
@731  = ~*thoughtfully* So did I.~
@732  = ~Fireheart, nothing restrains your spirit. Of late, though, I found that another thing affects me in the same self-contradictory way, as the ocean.~
@733  = ~Green suits you well.~
@734  = ~Yeah, and my hair's wavy. Do you mean that I remind you of the ocean? A vast, noisy and weepy kind of woman?~
@735  = ~*You smile, pleased.*~
@736  = ~Anything looks good on a beautiful woman like me.~
@737  = ~Were you running from something, fireheart? Or from someone?~
@738  = ~I was not running from. I was running towards my doom. Now, that it has been announced, I understand, that my dreams were a foreboding of greater things to come.~
@739  = ~Myself. I felt... alien in Candlekeep, an orphan girl, lonely and always cold. But why would you want to know of my grievances? You love merry women, Coran.~
@740  = ~I wanted to run, because I knew that in Candlekeep things like life, adventures and love were turned into records on yellowed parchment. I would give three lives as a Candlekeep monk for one as an adventurer. That's why I dreamt of running away.~
@741  = ~It is a necessity of youth to break the bondage of childhood memories. Those dreams simply meant that I have grown up.~
@742  = ~What's even more peculiar is that I found that another thing affects me in the same self-contradictory way as the ocean.~
@743  = ~There are lakes in the Forest of Tethyr and streams wide enough to be called rivers. I can swim, sweetling, but I beg you not to push me into the water this far north. Sneezing and coughing do not help a man aim accurately.~
@744  = ~*gasp* However did you guess my intention?~
@745  = ~*chuckle* Southerner's blood runs thin. I did not take you for a wimp, at first, who is afraid of a dip in the ocean.~
@746  = ~Indeed, I cannot lose my archer to influenza.~
@747  = ~If I'd gotten you sick, I'd get you healed, Coran.~
@748  = ~Because I have just found out that another thing affects me in the same way that the oceans do.~
@749  = ~My love for you. When I look into my heart, I cannot see another shore.~
@750  = ~Of course. Then let me give you what you are obviously interested in.~
@751  = ~No, it's my love for you that I find similar to the ocean. When I look into my heart, I cannot see another shore.~
@752  = ~It scares me, but it is also titillating. I can still see the beauty, grace, wit and charm in other women, but none of it attracts me as it used to. The whole notion of <CHARNAME> and 'other women' is... a novelty.~
@753  = ~*cough* this is not really a good time for discussing such intimate matters. Everyone is up already. Let us delay it 'til nightfall.~
@754  = ~The enchantment of novelty lasts only a short while, Coran. You'll be back to normal soon enough, and I will have to pry you loose from every passing skirt. *sigh*~
@755  = ~Let us hope that this fortunate affliction lasts.~
@756  = ~*look at Coran wide-eyed*~
@757  = ~My love for you is just like that ocean, and when I look into my heart I cannot see another shore. It is... a novelty, scary yet titillating.~
@758  = ~You are a wonder, sweetling. Of late I noticed that there is <CHARNAME>, and there are 'other women'. I can still see beauty, grace, wit and charm in other women, but none of it attracts me anymore... in other women.~
@759  = ~Greater things? I know nothing greater than what I feel for you.~
@760  = ~No, I do not love merry women, sweetling. I love you. I can still see beauty, grace, wit and charm in other women, but none of it attracts me anymore... in other women.~
@761  = ~I see... *dreamily* I did that before - I jumped on the first ship sailing out of a Waterdevian harbor. That is how I came to Baldur's Gate. <CHARNAME>... I... thought about doing it recently when I came to realize the oneness of <CHARNAME> and love to my heart.~
@762  = ~Then why you are still here?~
@763  = ~I heard about people doing such a thing when their hearts were broken... and they say that time heals any wounds, but in our case... Coran, how did I offend, that you now want to flee?~
@764  = ~*quietly* I have not chained your heart to mine, Coran. Take your leave when you wish, or stay and be but a comrade at arms.~
@765  = ~*laughs* A small imp was dancing in the depth of your eyes. And I would have dropped myself into ocean, should I be bored with my own ruminations and want to do mischief instead.~
@766  = ~In truth, for your smile I'd swim across the Sea of Moving Ice... I guess I am going mad. You see, I noticed recently that there is <CHARNAME>, and there are 'other women'. I can still see beauty, grace, wit and charm in other women, but none of it attracts me anymore... in other women.~
@767  = ~I know, my healer. Yet, being around you ailed me. You see, I noticed recently that there is <CHARNAME>, and there are 'other women'. I can still see beauty, grace, wit and charm in other women, but none of it attracts me anymore... in other women.~
@768  = ~Yes, but I do not want to keep it secret! I love you, and I am ready to cry that out from the mountain tops!~
@769  = ~*sigh* Or not.~
@770  = ~It is quite exciting and dangerous to put everything on one card. I think I like it.~
@771  = ~By Hanali Celanil, <CHARNAME>, I have nothing more to say to you... as if there were *anything* more to say.~
@772  = ~We are victims of the same affliction! When I look into my heart, I cannot see another shore.~
@773  = ~I see... in my case it's my love for you. When I look into my heart, I cannot see another shore.~
@774  = ~I could not imagine leaving you.~
@775  = ~You did not break my heart, you have changed it.~
@776  = ~Of late I noticed that there is <CHARNAME>, and there are 'other women'. I can still see beauty, grace, wit and charm in other women, but none of it attracts me anymore... in other women. My love for you is just like that very ocean, and when I look into my heart, I cannot see another shore. It is... a novelty, scary yet titillating.~
@777  = ~*cough* this is not really a good time for discussing such intimate matters. Everyone is up already. Let us delay it till the nightfall ~
@778  = ~What is it, sweetling?~
@779  = ~Love.~
@780  = ~Gorion's death. At first I thought the world would kill me without his protection and guidance. But I have survived and learned infinitely more than I would have been allowed should I have trod in his wake. So it both robbed me of my freedom, and gave me a new one.~
@781  = ~My heritage... On one hand, I have to be extremely careful abut every choice I make, and on another hand - I am a demi-god, and that means I can do pretty much anything.~
@782  = ~The tenets of my faith hold me to certain ways of behavior, but they also make my soul soar free and bathe in bliss.~
@783  = ~My duty binds me, but only through committing righteous deeds, no matter what sacrifices I make, do I find freedom and happiness.~
@784  = ~When I was young, I was afraid that my body would not have enough strength, agility and endurance to follow the routines my mind had devised. But quite often my body acts independently of my mind, and I feel marvelous.~

@786  = ~When I play other people's music, I am restricted by their words and tune, but as they go through me, they change... And my feelings are often expressed more freely by the words of great masters than by my own.~
@787  = ~I have to guard the secret of my gift closely, for its origin is mysterious, and the unknown oft breeds fear, but never do I feel more free than when I channel those magical energies.~
@788  = ~Towns and villages slow my step, and it is hard to breathe in the crowds, but a woman has to run with her own pack from time to time.~
@789  = ~Oh, mine? The Flaming Fist. Those guys are quite restrictive, heh. Yet eluding them makes a woman feel free and unbounded by the commoner's morale.~
@790  = ~My rage renders me nearly unthinking and exhausted... still, if I did not let my fury show, I would be a prisoner of it.~
@791  = ~A rogue's life is not a long one.~
@792  = ~And that is why it's so sweet.~
@793  = ~Even an elven one?~
@794  = ~Any adventurer risks dying before his time, Coran.~
@795  = ~It's not like you to lament it, Coran.~
@796  = ~Yes, and that is why I thought that I'd never promise to settle down, my light. Neither could I promise love eternal, nor that I should return after parting.~
@797  = ~Even elven. But I want a life full of adventures and dangers, even if I would not live to tell the tales to bored younglings five hundred years from today. That is why I thought that I'd never promise to settle down, my light. Neither could I promise love eternal, nor that I should return after parting.~
@798  = ~Yes. That might not be such a bad thing, since it makes it unnecessary to worry about our age difference. And, being adventurers, we have a fair chance of dying together, no matter what our life-span is.~
@799  = ~But I want a life full of adventure and danger, even if I would not live to tell the tales to bored younglings five hundred years from today. *sighs*~

@830  = ~<CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, daughter of Gorion, I love you. No matter what should transpire on my lonely walks they will all end by your campfire. By the stars and the sun and the twelve winds so I, Coran Sullussaer, swear.~
@831  = ~<CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, daughter of Gorion, I love you. You arms are my home, and by your side I will stay. By the stars and the sun and the twelve winds so I, Coran Sullussaer, swear.~
@832  = ~*whistles quietly* Now, that's a pretty girl! I do so like grand dames, but sometimes a tavern maid... They have this special sort of vulgar, flashy beauty to them. Look at her bearing, when she walks with that pile of plates. She could have been a queen in the palace- ~
@833  = ~*slap*~
@834  = ~Yeah, she is definitely very pretty. Beautiful hair... nature was truly generous to her... perhaps even overly generous, as far as her legs are concerned. No wonder she wears those woolen stockings. But other than hairy legs, she is a cutie.~
@835  = ~Am... Am I pretty?~
@836  = ~Excuse my absence for a while... that is, if you even notice it. *skulk away in frustration*~
@837  = ~I have heard a slap. Listen, sweetling, that is no way to treat a lover.~
@838  = ~Get used to it. It is *my* way to treat a lover who's ogling some tavern wench.~
@839  = ~Oh. I... am *so* sorry. I do not know what came over me. The light just went out... I do not know what happened next. Did I hurt you?~
@840  = ~It will leave a bruise on your pretty face - do not come running to me for healing, Coran. Of *any* sort.~
@841  = ~Oh, yes, now that you mentioned it. So why are we standing around, sweetling?~
@842  = ~Of course you are pretty. My <CHARNAME> is the prettiest of them all. *kisses you somewhat absentmindedly*~
@843  = ~You... you are just saying that to console me! I am not pretty... *sob*~
@844  = ~*kiss Coran back and smile* I knew it! I am the best!~
@845  = ~I... I am ready to give you everything, and you peer at barmaids!~
@846  = ~What's the matter, sweetling?~
@847  = ~Nothing. Nothing is the matter.~
@848  = ~Coran, you were good for me, and I was good for you. But now, I figure, is a good time to call it quits.~
@849  = ~Am...Am I pretty?~
@850  = ~What's the matter? What's the matter?! I... I am ready to give you everything, and you peer at barmaids!~
@851  = ~Thanks for asking, Master Womanizer.~
@852  = ~*catches your hand* I said - enough!~
@853  = ~Hmmm... a rather crude way.~
@854  = ~I will live. Let us go, <CHARNAME>, before the owner starts selling tickets to the customers who watch us. It would have been good fun, but we do not have our man in the crowd to profit from such a stir. And I do not like wasted opportunities.~
@855  = ~As you wish, <CHARNAME>. May you be as fortunate in your next lover as you were in me.~
@856  = ~Of course, you are. Come, sweetling, a bit of a melancholy now and then is quite attractive, but no man can stand it day in and day out. At least I cannot.~
@857  = ~Ah, the sun is shining again. Let us go, sweetling, there are matters to attend to, and foes to kill, and other things like that.~
@858  = ~So, my little bird got jealous? It's a good thing, <CHARNAME>. Love expires quickly if there're no excitement and no challenges.~
@859  = ~I do not like games, Coran. You were good for me, and I was good for you. But now it is time to call it quits.~
@860  = ~Coran, I swore to myself that the day I cannot have your undivided attention, I would leave you. It is apparent that this day has come.~
@861  = ~*wriggle away frantically* I...I hate you!~
@862  = ~You are right, but I loathe to be challenged by some lowlife serving wench with hairy legs.~
@863  = ~Oh... I... am *so* sorry. I do not know what came over me. The light just went out... I do not know what happened next. Did I hurt you?~
@864  = ~Really? You look like you are ready to chew through the inn's wall and pavement besides, all the way through to the sewers.~
@865  = ~Yes, you are right. It is starting to grow wearisome. May you be as fortunate in your next lover as you were in me.~
@866  = ~In that case, we better call it quits, before you try to do nasty and unspeakable things. May you be as fortunate in your next lover as you were in me.~
@867  = ~Hairy? Hmmm... you are right! That's why she wears those ugly woolen stockings. But, <CHARNAME>, the game is no fun if you know where it will come from.~
@868  = ~I yearn for you, beautiful. *Coran moves hair away from your neck and kisses it.*~
@869  = ~*giggle* You, troublemaker. *ruffle Coran's hair*~
@870  = ~Listen, no offence, but a man has to *really* impress me, if I'm to bed him more than once.~
@871  = ~Gods be good, not again!~
@872  = ~*moan, pleased, and lean on Coran*~
@873  = ~Trouble is better than stability and boredom. Just like it is better to be full than to be starved... and it is better to live with love in your heart, than with hatred.~
@874  = ~And it is better to be silent between kisses, than to talk.~
@875  = ~Well said, elf! Now, I think I just know what we can do to stir trouble and commove our hearts. Let's eat these exotic sweets you nicked the other day. Such a funny name... chocolate, was it?~
@876  = ~You are quite wrong... but when you look at me like that, I just do not care.~
@877  = ~Can you prove any of it?~
@878  = ~Oh... I must have formed a misconception of what the life in Candlekeep Library is.~
@879  = ~Indeed... Now, I would like to go to sleep. Alone.~
@880  = ~Candlekeep Library has quite a collection of books and manuscripts, from all corners of the known world, and on every subject imaginable. Younger acolytes are oft interested in applying bookish knowledge to matters of everyday life. Out of the desire to learn, of course.~
@881  = ~*laugh lightly* I was just teasing you, silly. Come here and let us enjoy each other.~
@882  = ~You are right. Repetition of even the sweetest thing gets boring, but we can introduce some... differences.~
@883  = ~I do not think there are any fruits from Sune's garden that we have not yet savored.~
@884  = ~It might well be, but I'd rather not.~
@885  = ~Fireheart, you are most passionate presently... oh, what a merry time we'll have... once I help you out of that shift... have you thought of something less... erm... antique?~
@886  = ~Woe to pauses! In your arms I will even forget to breathe. Love me, sweetling, will you?~
@887  = ~And presently I am slaying foes or what? You are real slow sometimes, Coran. *sigh*~
@888  = ~No. I would like to go to sleep. Alone.~
@889  = ~If that is your wish... *quietly* Damned delicacy!~
@890  = ~Then I shall look at you rather than talk, and I will kiss you all over. Love me, sweetling, will you?~
@891  = ~Here is my proof. *Coran kisses you deeply.* Does that... convince you that loving me is an enjoyable trouble?~
@892  = ~It is a very good proof, though I must insist on a more thorough investigation into the matter.~
@893  = ~No. You did not prove anything. I would like to go to sleep. Alone.~
@894  = ~Ah, how disappointing. *yawns* But, on the other hand, you are right. Repetition of even the sweetest thing gets boring.~
@895  = ~*Coran's eyes light up.* I thirst to drink of this fountain of knowledge soon.~
@896  = ~But you forgive me this small flaw... oh, what a grand time we'll have... once I help you out of that shift... have you thought of something less... erm... antique?~
@897  = ~Look, <CHARNAME>, the sun is rising again. Is that not a wonderful sight to behold? The new day has begun, and novel dreams are stirring in my heart.~
@898  = ~The sun is up already? Darn, there are never enough hours in the day for me!~
@899  = ~New dreams are good, but let us hope to encounter none but the old troubles. Gods be good, some of them almost feel like childhood friends! Who knows what to expect from the new ones.~
@900  = ~It's wondrous, is it not? Even as we have tread through the darkness, and despair almost had me. But now I am well and hopeful again, looking at the bright disk of the sun.~
@901  = ~Let the Morning Lord smile on us.~
@902  = ~Rebirth is the greatest of all the Great Mother's miracles.~
@903  = ~Ah, that is why you have to devote your nights to love and nothing else.~
@904  = ~You think so? Can you explain?~
@905  = ~Yes, Coran, that is the best time of my day, when I let go of all the day-troubles and think only of you.~
@906  = ~Let me remind you that we snatch time for leisure and gallantry whenever we can, whether the sun shines, the moon glimmers, or the stars twinkle in the sky above us.~
@907  = ~But that's what is fascinating about troubles! They are an enigma, a puzzle, and a mystery, while they are new.~
@908  = ~Perhaps that is why, all of us, Nature's children love novelty so. Indeed, who can resist the temptation of the unknown? New troubles are fascinating! They are an enigma, a puzzle, and a mystery, while they are new.~
@909  = ~But let them age unsolved, and they turn into problems and worries and issues.~
@910  = ~Just like men?~
@911  = ~Coran, I would not mind you talking so much, if you only talked sense. Troubles are troubles, new or old. I hope to have less of them.~
@912  = ~Unlike the bird's, your chirping spoils the glory of the sunrise, Coran.~
@913  = ~Sweetling, have you not learned anything from me? Nights should be devoted to love and adventure, not to despair.~
@914  = ~Nobody tells me what to do with my nights. If I wish to despair, I will despair for as long as I wish and whenever I wish.~
@915  = ~Yes, you taught me that, beloved. *You run your fingers from Coran's high cheekbone to his lips.*~
@916  = ~*You make your best effort at a carefree smile.*~
@917  = ~Erm... yes, of course, let him. Though I'd rather wish for Lady Luck's smiles. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, but sunrises never put me into a pious mood. I'll leave you to your revelations.~
@918  = ~Thank you, Coran.~
@919  = ~Oh, no, Coran, do not go away.~
@920  = ~When do your thoughts turn to gods, then?~
@921  = ~I thought I had shown you the difference between a night of worries and a night of love. If you did not grasp it from my lessons, you need a different teacher, <CHARNAME>.~
@922  = ~*Coran takes your chin with his fingers and turns your head, so you look into his eyes.* I cherish that you see no difference between thinking of me and of love, but I beg you to make this distinction.~
@923  = ~Sweetling, the main thing is that you do make time for it. What happens elsewhere is not important when lips touch. Though I have not yet kissed a girl under snow, it must be a bit like eating strawberries with ice... *closes his eyes* mmgh... perhaps a brunette, her hair color highlighted by the snow...~
@924  = ~I am a brunette... but I bet it was not me you were imagining.~
@925  = ~Mmgh... perhaps, snowflakes melting on a man's blond beard... and radiant blue eyes under a fur-trimmed hood... and we would listen to the sound of the snowflakes touching the ground in the crystal calm of the icy world.~
@926  = ~A brunette? I think I'd rather have someone with hair like fire to kiss amidst the snowflakes. Such a beautiful contrast!~
@927  = ~*sigh* I dream only of *you*, Coran, not of some unknown lad.~
@928  = ~Yes, and just like women. *kisses the tip of your nose* Let us go now, sweetling.~
@929  = ~*laughs* As for me, I dream to have more... but opposites attract each other. *kisses the tip of your nose* Let us go now, sweetling.~
@930  = ~Then I shall let you enjoy it in silence. But, really, many say that I have a pleasant singing voice.~
@931  = ~*waves his hands in front of his face as if dissipating poisonous vapors* Of course, my dear, of course.~
@932  = ~*Coran kisses your fingers.* Sweetling, I too wish we could stay like this in the sunshine for the rest of the day.~
@933  = ~*laughs merrily* Oh, no, that was not a smile. That was a crooked cane, or a bent willow... come, my joy, show me a real smile!~
@934  = ~*Coran bows politely and walks towards the rest of the group.*~
@935  = ~*Coran embraces your shoulders.* Sweetling, I too wish we could stay like this in the sunshine for the rest of the day.~
@936  = ~I worship Hanali Celanil, sweetling, the goddess of love. I experience the most fervent spiritual experience every time I love a woman. It is a wonderful way to show devotion, in my opinion.~
@937  = ~*plays with your hair* It could have been you, I suppose.~
@938  = ~It is a beautiful dream... I can imagine that you will make quite a handsome couple. But then again, you would look good on any man's arm.~
@939  = ~*Coran takes your chin with his fingers and turns your head, so you look into his eyes.* I cherish that you have so completely given your heart to this fancy we have taken in one another, but I beg of you not to close your eyes to other men when our dream ends. I'd hate to rob the world of the way you love.~
@940  = ~You know how I live, sweetling? I live in haste and try to savor as many pleasures as I can get to.~
@941  = ~I love not knowing what the next day brings, and I take ships without asking the captain what his destination is. This is the only way for a man to live, in order not to be diminished to a rotting stump.~
@942  = ~What you say may sound wise, but... Coran, you are rushing across the lands, and your friendships last mere hours. In the houses of strangers, you undress obedient wives, and your exhilaration while you lie together comes not from passion, but from the danger of discovery. Do you not want a change from the constant... chaos?~
@943  = ~*sigh* How romantic... I can love a man like that forever.~
@944  = ~Same goes for women, Coran. I conclude that just like me, you'll start feeling weighed down by our constancy. My darling, it is long past time we sought new experiences.~
@945  = ~Perhaps, <CHARNAME>, but today is not that day. *takes your hand* But if it were such a day, I would look for no other mate to settle down with than you.~
@946  = ~*smile* I will yet wear you down, elf. It's for your own good, you know.~
@947  = ~Are you trying to tell me something, beyond confessing that you like to live on impulse?~
@948  = ~I wish I had a stronger hold on you, but you already fancy someone else. Right?~
@949  = ~Not 'a man,' <CHARNAME>, but 'men.' Trust me, you'll learn much more about love and life if you don't stick with the same old lover forever.~
@950  = ~Old lover? Coran, we hardly even started... but what's the point of arguing? You fancy someone else, do you not?~
@951  = ~It is not some 'same old lover' we are talking about. It's *you*! Coran, I love you to distraction, with all your quirks and silliness. You should never worry about me leaving you.~
@952  = ~I will always be faithful to you, even after you leave. All these women you've bedded, and will bed in passing, do not matter. I will be the one you'll return to in the end, and you will bond with me.~
@953  = ~Hmmm... Just the other day I looked at... erm... never mind whom, and all sorts of frivolous thoughts entered my mind, and then I remembered you, and grew ashamed, as if I had stolen something of yours. I did not like the feeling.~
@954  = ~Forthright women are such a joy to deal with. *kisses you on the cheek* Shall we drink to new beginnings, sweetling?~
@955  = ~Bring the bottle, Coran. Cheers, my friend.~
@956  = ~*sigh* Coran, do find someone else to drink with.~
@957  = ~Yes! Getting fully and properly drunk is a great way to start a new era in my life!~
@958  = ~*salute Coran with the glass* To the new beginnings, Coran. Makes me wonder... what you shall feel lying with a regular woman, after you have tasted the daughter of Bhaal?~
@959  = ~*nibble at the tip of Coran's ear gently*~
@960  = ~*coughs* What I am trying to say, sweetling, is that you need a man that you do not need to 'wear down,' and who will be glad to commit his whole life to you... if that is what you wish. I would tell you to make it 'men,' not 'a man.' Trust me, you'll learn much more about love and life if you don't stick with the same old lover forever.~
@961  = ~You... You fancy someone else, do you not?~
@962  = ~Yes, you might say so, and her name is Freedom. Sweetling, there is fire for each other in our hearts yet, so it is now that we should part, not wait till it extinguishes itself or turns into hatred.~
@963  = ~I thought that you loved me as a man would, but I was wrong. You speak like a boy, and I do not need a fuzzy youngster's adoration. Go, find yourself a giggling wench. You are good at it. I love you no more.~
@964  = ~I always leave the feast table slightly hungry, Coran. Let us remain friends and keep fond memories of our affair.~
@965  = ~You've become disenchanted, and you make a two-hour speech out of it? One doesn't waste that many words to break up, Coran!~
@966  = ~So be it, a'maelamin. We will part now, and when passion renews itself as the phoenix-bird, we shall walk together again in the starlight.~
@967  = ~But I want you to leave me, and I want to leave you myself. Sweetling, there is fire for each other in our hearts yet, so it is now that we should part, not wait till it extinguishes itself or turns into hatred.~
@968  = ~I thought that you loved me as a man would, but I was wrong. You speak like a boy, and I do not need a fuzzy youngster's adoration. Go, find yourself a giggling wench. You are good at it. I love you no more.~
@969  = ~I do not know the future, lirimaer, but I know that it is time for us to part, for now, while there is fire for each other in our hearts. Ever that is the way of our kin.~
@970  = ~Fireheart, I've met no woman like you, but I know a man who is just like you. Me. I have never thought it possible, but we are going to have the best kind of fun sitting side-by-side and trading stories of our adventures and lovers.~
@971  = ~*laugh* If I ever need a pretend husband or a man to kindle jealousy in an inattentive lover, I know whom to ask.~
@972  = ~Do you realize, Coran, that you will never be able to disengage from me, and you will not let me become disengaged from you?~
@973  = ~That will *not* happen, Coran. I prefer being discreet.~
@974  = ~Cheers! To new beginnings!~
@975  = ~Oh, do not be such a spoilsport! I want to drink with a happy person... well, if not with you, then I'll drink to you. Hail the true lady of wit and charm and beauty. *winks* And to the fool who left her.~
@976  = ~One does not know such things in advance, sweetling.~
@977  = ~Did I mention not to do that, unless you mean to dance with me between the sheets? You do not mean to-~
@978  = ~*smile evasively and kiss Coran*~
@979  = ~I thought we might as well, since we have already broken up. It will be as nonchalant as it is exciting.~
@980  = ~Of course I do not, you bastard. But that expression on your face is priceless.~
@981  = ~*bows silently and turns away*~
@982  = ~It will be as you say.~
@983  = ~I do, sweetling.~
@984  = ~Until then, I am glad to serve you for as long as you have need of my skills.~
@985  = ~*laughs* I am afraid I cannot use you to spur jealousy, <CHARNAME>. Seeing you would dissuade any woman from competing.~
@986  = ~Then we shall write long letters to each other. You can start the first one now.~
@987  = ~*winks* You do not have to name names, <CHARNAME>.~
@988  = ~*Coran pulls you close.* That's quite... alluring, especially since there is a great chance that you will cut my throat in the morning. Irresistible, simply irresistible!~
@989  = ~The most amusing thing it was, that Briel actually believed that I would have her back the moment she presented me with her babe. *sighs* Some people just cannot let go.~
@990  = ~*wink* So, luck does not always side with the romantic?~
@991  = ~She might not have been willing to let you go, but from the way she looked, she did let *herself* go. Ewww... I'd never listen to anyone who says that maternity embellishes a woman!~
@992  = ~You definitely taught her how, Coran. Now, let us talk of *me*.~
@993  = ~Do not you speak to me about *that* woman and your get, or I'll ship you back to them. Gift-wrapped.~
@994  = ~It does, for my <CHARNAME> was there to talk me out of the madness, I had contemplated for a moment. *kiss*~
@995  = ~I was not going to lose you to this... sorceress.~
@996  = ~I was not going to lose you to this pathetic woman who dares to call herself a *sorceress*.~
@997  = ~You can always return and enjoy the quiet life of a husband and father. The way Briel looks, she will have a tough time finding a man willing to wed her.~
@998  = ~*kiss* The matter is hardly worth you thinking on it, my love.~
@999  = ~You almost disappointed me with your sudden outbreak of the 'I must do my duty' disease. I thought you to be more elevated above banal than that.~
@1000 = ~Eww... no. Pregnancy sometimes does. But the most striking change of all comes sometimes to an old maid, rewarding her for succumbing to temptation, she rejected sternly afore.~
@1001 = ~Indeed, I have heard of that. Men are not so lucky. So many lose all their attractiveness after the freshness of youth withers away under the winds of time... and women's touch.~
@1002 = ~A subtle hint, I see. *smile wantonly* I will let you find out on your own if I am a spinster or not.~
@1003 = ~And tell me, Coran, why do you deserve the gift of my maidenhead?~
@1004 = ~Well, you took care of that for me, dearest. *kiss*~
@1005 = ~Fascinating, but hardly worth wasting more time on debating it.~
@1006 = ~Coran, what you say sometimes makes me suspect that you yourself are a virgin.~
@1007 = ~Pink ribbon, I hope? *grins* It is always pleasing when your woman is ready to go to all sorts of trouble to make you presentable.~
@1008 = ~Quite clever, my darling, quite clever.~
@1009 = ~I have a thing for sorceresses. It is fascinating to lie with a woman who has magic flowing through her. Your sort bewitches me.~
@1010 = ~Sweetling, I think that if I ever have such a desire, it will be long after both Briel and that bastard, as humans would call her, are dead of old age.~
@1011 = ~Anything that prompts you to kiss me, is worth thinking of.~
@1012 = ~So did I, but no matter how one sweeps his house, the spiders weave the sticky nets of 'you must' in the corners.~
@1013 = ~I will help you kill the spiders, Coran.~
@1014 = ~I am happy that you have dodged the webs.~
@1015 = ~Ah, but you do not have to worry about it with me. My youthfulness is going to last for a few centuries yet.~
@1016 = ~It will, no doubt, last longer than my infatuation with you.~
@1017 = ~Ah, but I still will be young and beautiful when the weariness of the world seizes you.~
@1018 = ~That is why I always wanted an elven lover.~
@1019 = ~I am a devoted seeker of truth in that matter.~
@1020 = ~Because I am handsome, gentle and will never try to collar you with your gift.~
@1021 = ~So you say now, but as we have just learned, you have an unfortunate habit of leaving young sprouts in your wake.~
@1022 = ~I will think on what you have said.~
@1023 = ~Yes, and that was lovely. I have to confess that you made me change my faith. I used to be an adept of the 'virgins are too much bother and no pleasure, to boot' school of thinking.~
@1024 = ~I rarely speak to myself, for fear of convincing myself to do something risqu. So, I will follow your example and remain silent.~
@1025 = ~And you know perfectly well, that it is not true. Thus, you know that your mind is a liar.~
@1026 = ~Thank you, darling.~
@1027 = ~And so am I.~
@1028 = ~No doubt at all.~
@1029 = ~*shrug* I will not tarry overly long on this plane. Certainly not long enough to allow weariness to quell my spirit.~
@1030 = ~You have an exceptionally good taste, m'lady.~
@1031 = ~I assure you that I found it quite suspicious. I know how to brew cassil herb better than any druid. It never failed me before.~
@1032 = ~I am growing tired of the reprobating glances. My merry girl, you alone are my consolation.~
@1033 = ~You are imagining things, elf. Nobody is even looking at you.~
@1034 = ~Well, I am here. What are you waiting for? Wrap your hands about me and kiss me, already.~
@1035 = ~Let them stare, they are either hypocrites or stupid.~
@1036 = ~Ah, well. People are too quick to judge and to demand others to do their duty. For themselves, they always find an excuse.~
@1037 = ~They are all *avoiding* me. *angrily* Because of that bastard!~
@1038 = ~Oh, no, not again! Coran... Coran, are you drunk?~
@1039 = ~Hmm... which one? Gorion's or yours?~
@1040 = ~Hmm... which one? Namara or me?~
@1041 = ~*laugh* Your bastard or Bhaal's bastard?~
@1042 = ~*mockingly* And what did you expect, you, undeserving elven brat? Leaving a hapless babe like that... Tsk, tsk... a poor little girl...~
@1043 = ~Pack up and go. I do not need a milksop in my party!~
@1044 = ~And they would only sniff when I tell them that it's how it is *always* done. A half-breed stays with the *mother*. Why am I supposed to be better than others?~
@1045 = ~You're telling me? Never seen a whiff of my mother in my whole life!~
@1046 = ~Coran, there are always settled men about, who sooner or later will do the job for you. *shrug* I knew no father but Gorion, and perhaps I am much better for that.~
@1047 = ~Ha, Coran, you aren't that bad. At least, you did not *force* yourself upon Briel, like my beloved sire.~
@1048 = ~You know that for a fact? About half-bloods, I mean?~
@1049 = ~You are better than others, more honest, at least.~
@1050 = ~*with dignity* Yes.~
@1051 = ~And proud of it?~
@1052 = ~Oh, good. That should loosen you up. *laugh* Let me see now, if you are drunk enough to be seduced by a passing wench... *kiss Coran*~
@1053 = ~Oh, good. That should loosen you up. *laugh* Let me see now if you are drunk enough to be seduced by a passing wench... *kiss Coran*~
@1054 = ~Because of the bastard?~
@1055 = ~Pack up and go. I do not need a milksop in my party.~
@1056 = ~Gorion had a bastard child? I thought he was above such base instincts.~
@1057 = ~Why, is not that obvious? Would a lonely sage adopt an 'orphan,' such as myself, out of desire to have a snooty girl running under his feet?~
@1058 = ~I meant myself, my smart lover. Since I have no memory of my mother, I cannot vouch for her decent nature, can I? Though, I also do not know just how indecent. Perhaps, it was not just Gorion who played with her on the wrong side of the sheets. Or, perhaps, I am a legitimate heir to some crown, spirited away from court intrigues.~
@1059 = ~*shrug* I heard it whispered that I am Gorion's bastard, or that he bedded my mother and she entrusted him with her get from another man... No! It cannot be true!~
@1060 = ~Coran... Coran, are you drunk?~
@1061 = ~Namara. *sighs* Those stupid humans invented the silly notion of legitimacy of parentage. Our kin does not care a single bit for it. So you are not a bastard in my eyes...~
@1062 = ~So, I am not a bastard, and Namara is?~
@1063 = ~Unfortunate it is, that Namara is half-human. These terrible brutes are going to treat her unfairly... who knows why...~
@1064 = ~A simple orphan, then? Alas. There is a certain romantic appeal in the status of the base-born amongst humans.~
@1065 = ~Shhh... I am not drunk enough to be completely uncaring about what I am saying. It is an ill omen to name your... erm... parent. But I do not think that anybody would dare to begrudge me our liaison.~
@1066 = ~Coran... Coran, are you drunk?~
@1067 = ~Commoners are more like to pity you for it, my poor lamb.~
@1068 = ~*laugh* Why would you not say that it was demonical and arrogant <CHARNAME> who coerced you into abandoning your babe and her rival? I bet there would be a line-up of women from here to Westgate, weeping over your fall from grace and striving to redeem you with their gentleness.~
@1069 = ~You do not mind kissing Bhaal's daughter, but you would not name my father?~
@1070 = ~But that's how it's *always* done. A half-breed stays with the *mother*. Why am I supposed to be better than others?~
@1071 = ~*laughs* Delicious. Will you return my kiss with the same passion and decisiveness?. *Coran leans to kiss <CHARNAME>'s neck and starts to undo the laces at her collar.*~
@1072 = ~I... I forgive you... just do not stop, darling.~
@1073 = ~*pout* That's all you ever want of me, kisses and tumbling on straw. Do you ever *listen* to me?~
@1074 = ~*coldly* I said - go.~
@1075 = ~And that made you into a proper charming brat!~
@1076 = ~*Coran leans to kiss <CHARNAME>'s neck and starts to undo the laces at her collar.*~
@1077 = ~*coldly* Quit it, pert rapscallion.~
@1078 = ~Hopefully, Namara has enough of my blood to overcome such bad influences. Settled men... phew...~
@1079 = ~*laugh and kiss Coran* Just be careful when you pass through Baldur's Gate in forty years, lover. As the bards teach us, old sinners are oft punished by unknowingly bedding their daughters of like temperament, or in some twisted revenge plot.~
@1080 = ~I wish you were more like them... like Gorion, Coran. I am serious.~
@1081 = ~The day I force myself upon a woman, I am done for. I am glad that, as ever, the toothless saying is wrong, and you do not look for the like of your sire in a lover. For I largely prefer women going after me, and not claiming that I've got a child by them.~
@1082 = ~You know, I doubt that all of them were forced. There was a certain dark attractiveness of power about my sire.~
@1083 = ~Brrr... such unpleasant thoughts... rapes, family matters... Should we conjure something more exhilarating for the heart? *kiss Coran*~
@1084 = ~I would know better than to tell you if I carry your son.~
@1085 = ~It's customary, yes. Unfortunately, her mother is human, and stupid humans invented the silly notion of legitimacy of parentage.~
@1086 = ~*grins* Not to mention - more handsome. Now, that we have established that fact-~
@1087 = ~*nods and giggles* I am searching for the truth... they say it's in wine.~
@1088 = ~From all places for it to be, a full goblet is certainly the most attractive as a search destination. Pass me that wine skin, Coran, be a good elf.~
@1089 = ~*grin* Let us see now if you are tipsy enough to be seduced by a passing wench... *kiss Coran*~
@1090 = ~I do not need a man who cannot hold his wine. Go, sleep it off, and if you ever drink yourself silly like this again, I will leave you in a roadside ditch.~
@1091 = ~I am drunk, in love, and my wench has fire in her. I'm a happy man. Hmmm... did some dwarf forge the lacing on your bodice? It's worse than some locks I've picked. *giggles* Let us sell it to some merchant who can use it for his treasure chest. You do not need it anyway in my company.~
@1092 = ~I am drunk, in love, and my wench has fire in her. I'm a happy man. Hmmm... did some dwarf forge the lacing on your bodice? Its worse than some locks I've picked. *giggles* Let us sell it to some merchant who can use it for his treasure chest. You and me, we should just follow the ways of our kin and walk around in sun-bathed nudity. *giggle* Much more convenient this way.~
@1093 = ~Well, yes! Why I should be better than everyone else? A half-blood *belongs* with her mother.~
@1094 = ~All right, I got it. *laugh* Let me see now if you are drunk enough to be seduced by a passing wench...*kiss Coran*~
@1095 = ~All right, I got it. *laugh* Let me see now if you are drunk enough to be seduced by a passing wench...*Kiss Coran*~
@1096 = ~Perhaps, he hoped that the mischievous brat would grow into the beauty I see now afore me, and would fall for him... But I beat the old goat to your maiden charms!~
@1097 = ~Choose a kingdom, dear, and I shall name you its Queen. What do you want? Tethyr? Cormyr? Mulhorand?~
@1098 = ~That's peanuts. I want the whole world to hail me as their Queen and bow to me.~
@1099 = ~Tethyr, of course. Then, I will be your Queen and can order you around. Unfortunately, that chit Zaranda is more likely to get it than I.~
@1100 = ~Ah, they do not have kings and queens in Mulhorand, just pharaoh.~
@1101 = ~<CHARNAME>, to succeed the mighty King Azuon IV? Might not be a bad idea, but I would not marry that man even for the title of the Queen!~
@1102 = ~*nods agreeably* Of course it is not.~
@1103 = ~You are... different. Namara's mother is human, and she is therefore bound to be raised among these brutes, who invented the silly notion of legitimacy of parentage.~
@1104 = ~Elven kin does not care a single bit for it! But the humans think that bastards are all lewd and untrustworthy.~
@1105 = ~*laugh* Are you base-born, per chance, Coran?~
@1106 = ~Namara was certainly conceived of both lust and treachery.~
@1107 = ~Oh, cap it. Plenty of base-borns rise high in human society. Why, even in your own Tethyr, there was a half-elven bastard Kymer who succeeded King Alemander II, or some such.~
@1108 = ~Is that so? I am of the opinion that the humans think all bastards lewd and untrustworthy. But luck is always on the side of a romantic.~
@1109 = ~Namara was certainly conceived of both lust and treachery.~
@1110 = ~Oh, cap it. Plenty of base-born raise high in human society. Why, even in your own Tethyr, there was a half-elven bastard Kymer who succeeded King Alemander II or some such.~
@1111 = ~Ah, yes. Poor, poor Coran. Will you take pity on the lad and warm him up, my good woman?~
@1112 = ~Perhaps, we can start on creating this legend right now, my man-eating Bhaalspawn? Let us spin a tale that will make all good women's hair bristle, their tongues wag in disapproval, and their hearts grow small with envy!~
@1113 = ~Let me see if I mind kissing you.~
@1114 = ~I am drunk, in love, and my wench has fire in her. I'm a happy man.~
@1115 = ~*continues to fight with the lacing* We have not yet tried it on the straw pile... it can be a prickly affair, if you take my meaning. See, I listen to you.~
@1116 = ~*pull away* Get lost.~
@1117 = ~*laugh breathlessly* Prickly indeed... oh, do not stop!~
@1118 = ~*mocking bow* Fare thee well, little bird.~
@1119 = ~Ah, yes, revenge... it is sort of odd when a person tries to seek vengeance upon someone for giving her life. Hopefully, Namara won't be that mule-headed... and I will avoid bedding half-elves... that should be punishment enough for an old sinner.~
@1120 = ~You want me to become a stuffy old wizard? Wow, you have quite a taste... Perhaps, *this* can convince you otherwise.~
@1121 = ~Hey, what this sigh for? I think I know what you need, fireheart.~
@1122 = ~Yes... some women's tastes are... peculiar. But yours is excellent, my sweet lover.~
@1123 = ~*looks abashed* Wh-what? Are you... by any chance?~
@1124 = ~*smile smugly* I am not telling you...~
@1125 = ~With child? Oh, no. Do not worry. Children are perhaps the only thing which I enjoy trying to make, never succeeding. *kiss Coran* Come here, Coran.~
@1126 = ~Whatever you say, sweetheart.~
@1127 = ~And he was greatly loved by his people. That's why they called him Shade King and the Usurper. Why are we talking about politics, sweetling? The night grows short!~
@1128 = ~Where I no doubt belong... poor, poor Coran. Nobody loves him.~
@1129 = ~You sound too serious. Have sweet dreams of your world empire. I am interested in more... local affairs.~
@1130 = ~She is no match to you! Why are we talking about politics, sweetling? The night grows short!~
@1131 = ~Why are we talking about politics, sweetling? The night grows short!~
@1132 = ~Right.~
@1133 = ~Excuse my absence for a while... that is if you even notice it. *skulk away in frustration*~
@1134 = ~I have heard a slap. Listen, sweetling, that is no way to treat a lover.~
@1135 = ~You... you are just saying that to console me! I am not pretty... *sob*~
@1136 = ~Coran, you were good for me, and I was good for you. But now, I figure, is a good time to call it quits.~
@1137 = ~What's the matter? What's the matter?! I... I am ready to give you everything, and you peer at barmaids!~
@1138 = ~Of course, you are. Come, sweetling, a bit of a melancholy now and then is quite attractive, but no man can stand it day in and day out. At least I cannot.~
@1139 = ~Ah, the sun is shining again. Let us go, sweetling, there are matters to attend to and foes to kill and other things like that.~
@1140 = ~*wriggle away frantically* I... I hate you!~
@1141 = ~In that case, we better call it quits, before you try to do nasty and unspeakable things. May you be as fortunate in your next lover as you were in me.~
@1142 = ~I am feverish, <CHARNAME>, and my delusional dreams are of you. Do me a kindness, and put your cool narrow hand on my forehead.~
@1143 = ~*You are genuinely concerned about Coran's sudden ailment and do not know its cause.* You are burning indeed! Has the healer missed a wound?~
@1144 = ~*You are genuinely concerned about Coran's sudden ailment and think it to be very strange indeed. You need to examine Coran to learn the cause of it.* Hmm... you are right. Perhaps, a brew of white willow bark is all you need, but I would like to examine you.~
@1145 = ~*You smile contentedly, remembering how you slipped poison in Coran's wine, and ask with vivid interest:* Tell me, is your throat going dry yet?~
@1146 = ~*You remember how you slipped poison in Coran's wine, and say coldly:* I thought that elves never got sick.~
@1147 = ~*You struggle with pangs of guilt, remembering slipping poison in Coran's wine.* You have been poisoned, Coran.~
@1148 = ~*You start sobbing.* Coran... I... I have poisoned you! I am so... so sorry.~
@1149 = ~Excuse me... I think I am going to be... sick... *Coran chokes and starts retching. He is obviously having difficulty standing. Rivulets of sweat are trickling down his forehead into his eyes.*~
@1150 = ~Thank you for sharing. Well, get lost, and we'll talk when you get better. *You walk away in disgust.*~
@1151 = ~Coran, this smell... it is vaguely familiar to me. Have you met anyone who'd have a reason to try to poison you, or have you chewed on anything unwittingly?~
@1152 = ~Coran... I do not like how you look.~
@1153 = ~The Nine Hells, you're only getting sicker! Drink some water, I beg of you... or something.~
@1154 = ~You are *drunk* again, that's what it is!~
@1155 = ~Sleep well, my love, and get better by the morning. *You walk away.*~
@1156 = ~I... I do not think that I shall... get better. Wicked poison... Darn, it hurts!~
@1157 = ~How... how did you know? *Coran chokes and starts retching. He is obviously having difficulty standing. The rivulets of sweat are trickling down his forehead into his eyes.*~
@1158 = ~A guess. *smirk* Sleep well, my love, and get better by the morning.~
@1159 = ~Because that's how belladonna powder is supposed to work. You are going to be dead in about three hours... or so. I heard that elves have exceptionally low resistance to this poison.~
@1160 = ~I put belladonna powder into your drink, Coran. You are dying a slow death.~
@1161 = ~Much good it does to me now... I need a healer, <CHARNAME>...~
@1162 = ~*smirk* No you do not. Just sleep it off, and you will get better in the morning.~
@1163 = ~Let me see if I am good at delving. Do you feel like retching? Is your throat going dry?~
@1164 = ~You... you have poisoned me?! But why? *Coran's breath becomes labored, and he begins choking again.*~
@1165 = ~*coldly* I'm only making myself safe, Coran. I foresee that you would betray me for love, and I cannot allow it to happen. Let me kiss you a farewell now. I love you and I will mourn you, elf.~
@1166 = ~Remember that girl in the inn you stared at? I decided that if I can't have you, then nobody shall.~
@1167 = ~I hate you for how much it hurts every time you look at another. I hate you, and I want it to stop!~
@1168 = ~*hiss* You are clueless, aren't you, thief? You have stolen from me that which a woman can give only once, and it means naught to you! You have despoiled me, made me into a street woman, left me witless and quivering with desire... And now I see clearly that, for all that, you are going to walk out on me. You will die for that!~
@1169 = ~I wanted to see you kneeling before me and begging for your life.~
@1170 = ~I do not truly know... just a gray mood, I guess.~
@1171 = ~That girl... the girl in the inn. She fetched me a drink, and we... we talked when you left. I did not tell you, but I knew her once.~
@1172 = ~And her brother... though him I knew only momentarily. He caught us and attacked me - insane man. What was I supposed to do?~
@1173 = ~She said at the time that he was the meanest thing which lived, a drunkard and that he beat her... so I thought she was better off, anyway. And she did not bring it up at all yesterday. But perhaps...~
@1174 = ~Perhaps she thought that you returned to take care of her or some such sentimental nonsense and got severely disappointed when she saw me on your arm.~
@1175 = ~*nod* She changed her mind. I see. Now, let us try to put some water and some antidote in you. If that does not help, I do not know what will.~
@1176 = ~Whatever. Let us pray she used only belladonna, not some exotic mix. Try to retch and drink... drink as much water as you can! I'll add betony leaf to antidote and then... then we can only hope for the best.~
@1177 = ~Oh... well, I am afraid we can only hope that she knew nothing of poisons, or that your elven resistance will prevail.~
@1178 = ~Then turn away, you stupid girl! Go somewhere! *Coran's breath becomes labored, and he begins choking again.*~
@1179 = ~*pout* Talk to me when you are... hale.~
@1180 = ~No, Coran, I am not leaving you alone like that. Say... do you think anyone might have tried to... poison you?~
@1181 = ~Leave me be! Leave me alone... do not stare... damn you! *Coran's breath becomes labored, and he begins choking again.*~
@1182 = ~Woman... cannot you tell the difference between sickness and a hangover? I need a healer.~
@1183 = ~Hold on, dear, help is near. Erm... tell me, did you eat anything you should not or something? Or... can it be... poison?~
@1184 = ~No, Coran, I am not leaving you alone like that. Say... do you think anyone might have tried to... poison you?~
@1185 = ~Why... why would not you kill the wench instead?~
@1186 = ~*smile* I have already done it, Coran. I quite enjoyed cutting your little hussy's throat, but I thought it would be too easy of an end for you.~
@1187 = ~You underestimate me. She is comparing the touch of your lips to the touch of the Sea of Swords' bottom.~
@1188 = ~*chuckle* She drunk the same wine you did when you met yesterday behind my back, Coran.~
@1189 = ~All three of us will die tonight.~
@1190 = ~And what was her fault? You are the one who deserves to be punished.~
@1191 = ~I did not steal your maidenhead, <CHARNAME>, nor had you mentioned that you considered it a bribe. At any rate, my death won't make you a virgin again. But if I live... if you wish so much to wed me... I promise I will marry you.~
@1192 = ~Really? I... I did not plan for it. I have no antidote, Coran.~
@1193 = ~You dare to propose a marriage? Pathetic... Beg, worm, beg for your useless life.~
@1194 = ~That's so exciting! *clap your hands* I guess I need to keep you alive then... Now, let us try to put some water and some antidote in you. If that does not help, I do not know what will.~
@1195 = ~*Coran kneels and extends his hands toward you* Please... have mercy, <CHARNAME>... antidote...~
@1196 = ~Very satisfactory. A pity it is, that I do not have it.~
@1197 = ~*laugh* How could I ever have loved you, weakling? Here, drink this.~
@1198 = ~No woman yet tried to poison me... just stabbing, for some reason. I remember how my would be killer's hand bandaged me gently afterwards. Has your mood changed yet, <CHARNAME>?~
@1199 = ~Yes. Now I want you dead even more than before.~
@1200 = ~Healing you? It could be interesting. And this paleness makes you look sophisticated. It would be a pity to waste it on death convulsions. Here, drink this.~
@1201 = ~My poor dear... How could I have been so cruel? *cry*~
@1202 = ~You chastised me sufficiently, <CHARNAME>... No woman yet tried to poison me... just stabbing, for some reason. I remember how my would be killer's hand bandaged me gently afterwards. Has your mood changed yet, <CHARNAME>?~
@1203 = ~I would never know what exactly she thought... if I perish.~
@1204 = ~But you should perish knowing that your death was well deserved. It should be comforting.~
@1205 = ~Let us hope that she knew nothing of poisons, or that your elven resistance will prevail.~
@1206 = ~*nod* Time is running short for you, from the look of it. Let us try to put some water and some antidote in you. If that does not help, I do not know what will.~
@1207 = ~Get away from me, murderous snake. There is enough of your venom coursing through my veins without listening to your poisonous words.~
@1208 = ~*impatiently* ANTIDOTE! Give it to me, you... stup- erm... stupendous beauty.~
@1209 = ~A... antidote? I... I do not have any. You are not angry with me, are you?~
@1210 = ~Rats and crows! Here, drink this.~
@1211 = ~Yes... yes... of course. Here it is... You are not angry with me, are you?~
@1212 = ~My healer... my gentle healer... come, sit closer and I shall whisper into your ear all the dreams I had about you in my fever. I think we should try to have one or two to come to life...~
@1213 = ~If Coran is flirting, Coran is alive. *kiss* I am glad that you lived, my love, but I cannot delay our departure any further.~
@1214 = ~*giggle* Really? You have the command of my ear... and of my body, Coran.~
@1215 = ~Coran, I watched over you this night. I heard you calling my name, and I guessed at the nature of your dreams. I must confess that my imagination carried me away also, so I think we are going to have a very lively... erm... discussion.~
@1216 = ~I have done a lot of thinking, while watching over you last night, Coran. We cannot go on like this.~
@1217 = ~So, where is my beautiful fiance? By the way, I would like to appoint the date. We shall be wed on that very date exactly 1000 years from now, sweetling. I should write to my parents, they will be pleased.~
@1218 = ~You, trickster! You... cheated!~
@1219 = ~*raise you hand to stop Coran from speaking* I have done a lot of thinking. I was wrong. I free you from your vow. You do not have to marry me. Not now, not a 1000 years from now.~
@1220 = ~Sounds good. I can just imagine you coming to seek me out, gray and bent and weary with years... perhaps we can combine both wedding and funeral feast.~
@1221 = ~*cry* I thought... I thought you loved me... Just... just leave me be! Forever!~
@1222 = ~You! I am going to kill you!~
@1223 = ~*bows* I am learning from you, my little poisoner and blackmailer.~
@1224 = ~*mockingly* There is no pleasing you, is there, my love?~
@1225 = ~Now, that's just getting boring. I am afraid it is bad for my health to stay in your company. Fare thee well, my tender assassin.~
@1226 = ~Another day, another slaughter. Do you not find it tedious? Would that I be loved by a woman for every man I kill nowadays and every monster too. What a game it would be!~
@1227 = ~You are loved by a woman for every man you slaughter.~
@1228 = ~Do not be greedy, Coran. Exclude the monsters, lest you overexert yourself... by counting.~
@1229 = ~Loved, Coran, or lusted after?~
@1230 = ~Be careful of what you wish for, elfman, for it may come to pass.~
@1231 = ~Coran, what we are doing is not a game. There is nothing jolly about it!~
@1232 = ~Exactly, by *one* woman. And I am going too slow to achieve my goal of fondling my thousandth wench on my deathbed.~
@1233 = ~*sigh* Oh, bother...~
@1234 = ~*wink* That would be me, of course.~
@1235 = ~You are setting your plank too low. I, myself, would not settle for less than five thousand. Maybe I should join an army.~
@1236 = ~I... I hate you!~
@1237 = ~*dreamily* Killing a man is a reward in itself... All men are bastards.~
@1238 = ~Not the way *you* do it, grouchy one.~
@1239 = ~I used to adventure with a bard called Helg. Once, we hired ourselves out to beat back a band of goblins which terrorized some village in Amn, near Trademeet, or some such. It would have been grim going, with all those greenish devils jumping up at us, screaming and splattering us with their black blood.~
@1240 = ~But Helg offered me a deal - to buy a night with a concubine for every monster I killed above his count. Needless to say, I offered to do the same, and we had the most jovial competition. And a fun time in Athkatla, afterwards.~
@1241 = ~That's just... disgusting. One should not turn killing into fun.~
@1242 = ~I have better things to do than listen to tales of you whoring around, with or without friends!~
@1243 = ~So, who won?~
@1244 = ~What has happened to this Helg? He'd make a fine companion, I wager.~
@1245 = ~Coran, do you suggest that *I* buy you a wench?~
@1246 = ~Why, love, of course, my precious. Love is the spice that makes rations into a gourmet dish. *winks*~
@1247 = ~You presume to inspire deeper feelings than you have yourself?~
@1248 = ~I pity you then, for you have spent your life eating but dried meat and waybread.~
@1249 = ~I have forgotten what a die-hard romantic you are. Perhaps you can remind me of it later?~
@1250 = ~Too much spice in a meal can make one cry...~
@1251 = ~Perhaps. One never knows, eh? *brightens up* But one can always lift his or her spirits with a clever trick...~
@1252 = ~*laughs* A good one! There is always a way to make things less dull.~
@1253 = ~And all women are fools. I can live with that.~
@1254 = ~I am an exception then, for I will not keep a lover of such a persuasion.~
@1255 = ~You can. Not for very long, though. Never take anyone for a fool, Coran.~
@1256 = ~*laugh and ruffle Coran's hair* Of course, my boy.~
@1257 = ~*You turn aside to conceal the trembling of your lips.* We... we'd better get going, dear.~
@1258 = ~Sweetling, let me teach you one thing. Never do that which does not please you, or interest you, or is fun for you.~
@1259 = ~One has no choice in the matter.~
@1260 = ~But duty and obligations...~
@1261 = ~You are right. I will start thinking on what I'd want to do, rather than wandering across the land and slaying everything I perceive as an enemy.~
@1262 = ~And what makes you think that you are in a position to *teach* me?~
@1263 = ~Do you doubt me?~
@1264 = ~Never!~
@1265 = ~Of course!~
@1266 = ~What happened to this Helg? He'd make a fine companion, I wager.~
@1267 = ~Whatever. Tell me what, did you mean to suggest that *I* buy you a wench?~
@1268 = ~Hmm... about Helg... You see, the last time I saw him, we were waiting at Athkatla's dock for a merchant ship to sail to Calimport.~
@1269 = ~Inopportunely, the Magistrate was passing through, and since I had a small matter unresolved with her... and she had a dozen of the city's watchmen on her heels, I chose to take the first ship that sailed off.~
@1270 = ~It so happened that I was carrying our company's treasury on me. Not that it was much, but knowing Helg, I'd have to fight him the moment I see him, and I would not want to injure an old comrade at arms... or let him cut me into stripes before I explained things.~
@1271 = ~But you have a good eye for men, sweetling. Helg is a great fellow.~
@1272 = ~Unless you can come up with a better bet. I, for example, can advise you how to seduce the man of you choice... or something.~
@1273 = ~I'd agree to my part of the bargain if you'd put up one faithful year for each kill I have on you.~
@1274 = ~I do not want to play a stupid game like that.~
@1275 = ~Sounds good to me!~
@1276 = ~How about we just make it mugs of ale?~
@1277 = ~Now, that I think about it, I like the concubine plan.~
@1278 = ~*grins* Do you presume to measure love?~
@1279 = ~Just give a command to stop for rest, sweetling.~
@1280 = ~I am sorry to disappoint you, but you just proved that you are not an exception, but the rule.~
@1281 = ~Beware of Wisdom, my love, or rather, of its twin sister, Boredom.~
@1282 = ~Are you in melancholy, sweetling. That won't do at all. Perhaps you *should* think of doing something different. Or, at least come up with a trick which will make your life more bearable.~
@1283 = ~*shrugs* There are only two choices, sweetling. To live your life the way you want, or to let everyone and his dog push you into doing what they want. Chose the first one, dear, I beg of you. You are way too beautiful to become one who drifts listlessly to her grave and, with a satisfied smile, finds no difference between life and death.~
@1284 = ~*laughs*~
@1285 = ~That's my girl! *Coran kisses you on the cheek first, then on your lips... and again...* Sweetling, do not you think that it's long past time that we... erm... halted for rest?~
@1286 = ~I may not be the cleverest thief in the Realms, but I can see a trap when it is laid by my feet, <CHARNAME>.~
@1287 = ~We could. But where is the thrill in that?~
@1288 = ~Let me remind you, that we snatch time for leisure and gallantry whenever we can; whether the sun shines, the moon glimmers or the stars twinkle in the sky above us.~
@1289 = ~Yes, you taught me that, beloved. *You run your fingers from Coran's high cheekbone to his lips.*~
@1290 = ~Erm...yes, of course, let him. Though I'd rather wish for Lady Luck's smiles. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, but sunrises never put me into a pious mood. I'll leave you to your revelations.~
@1291 = ~Thank you, Coran.~
@1292 = ~Oh, no, Coran, do not go away.~
@1293 = ~What does turn your thoughts to gods then?~
@1294 = ~I thought, I had shown you the difference between a night of worries and a night of love. If you did not grasp it from my lessons, you need a different teacher, <CHARNAME>.~
@1295 = ~*Coran takes your chin with his fingers and turns your head, so you look into his eyes* I cherish that you see no difference between thinking of me and of love, but I beg you to make this distinction.~
@1296 = ~Sweetling, the main thing is that you do make time for it. What happens elsewhere is not important when lips touch. Though I have not yet kissed a girl under snow, It must be a bit like eating strawberries with ice...*closes his eyes* mmgh...perhaps a brunette, her hair color highlighted by the snow...~
@1297 = ~I am a brunette...but I bet it was not me you were imagining.~
@1298 = ~Mmgh...perhaps, snowflakes melting on a man's blond beard...and radiant blue eyes under a fur-trimmed hood...and we would listen to the sound of the snowflakes touching the ground in the crystal calm of the icy world.~
@1299 = ~*Sigh* I dream only of *you*, Coran, not of some unknown lad.~
@1300 = ~*Coran kisses your fingers.* Sweetling, I, too, wish we could stay like this in the sunshine for the rest of the day.~
@1301 = ~*laughs merrily* Oh, no, that was not a smile. That was a crooked cane, or a bent willow... Come, my joy, show me a real smile!~
@1302 = ~*Coran takes your chin with his fingers and turns your head, so you look into his eyes.* I cherish that you have so completely given your heart to this fancy we have taken in one another, but I beg of you not to close your eyes to other men, when our dream ends. I'd hate to rob the world of the way you love.~
@1303 = ~What you say may sound wise, but... Coran, you are rushing across the lands, and your friendships last mere hours. In the houses of strangers, you undress obedient wives, and your exhilaration while you lie together comes not from passion, but from the danger of discovery. Do you not want a change from the constant... chaos?~
@1304 = ~Old lover? Coran, we hardly even started... but what's the point of arguing? You fancy someone else, do you not?~
@1305 = ~I will always be faithful to you, even after you leave. All these women you've bedded, and will bed in passing, do not matter. I will be the one you'll return to in the end and you will bond with me.~
@1306 = ~*salute Coran with the glass* To new beginnings, Coran. Makes me wonder... what you shall feel lying with a regular woman after you have tasted the daughter of Bhaal?~
@1307 = ~You... You fancy someone else, do you not?~
@1308 = ~I will always be faithful to you, even after you leave. All these women you've bedded, and will bed in passing, do not matter. I will be the one you'll return to in the end and you will bond with me.~
@1309 = ~Yes, you might say so, and her name is Freedom. Sweetling, there is fire for each other in our hearts yet, so it is now that we should part, not wait 'til it extinguishes itself or turns into hatred.~
@1310 = ~Do you realize, Coran, that you will never be able to disengage from me, and you will not let me become disengaged from you?~
@1311 = ~That will *not* happen, Coran. I prefer being discreet.~
@1312 = ~Cheers! To new beginnings!~
@1313 = ~Oh, do not be such a spoilsport! I want to drink with a happy person... well, if not with you, then I'll drink to you. Hail the true lady of wit and charm and beauty. *winks* And to the fool who left her.~
@1314 = ~One does not know such things in advance, sweetling.~
@1315 = ~Did I mention not to do that, unless you mean to dance with me between the sheets? You do not mean to-~
@1316 = ~I thought we might as well since we have already broken up. It will be as nonchalant as it is exciting.~
@1317 = ~I remembered just now how it happened when I first loved you. It was a small gesture you made, a twirl of your wrist, no more, that you did inadvertently, and that attracted my attention. Your sleeve slid down, revealing your arm to the elbow, and suddenly I was aware that your garments were but wrapping that concealed a thing I wanted more than anything else in the world.~
@1318 = ~My heart pounded within its cage, and cried unto my ears to run away for surely it should burst if I would be denied upon asking. My mind stilled it with a gentle word, pitying it, and I went to you, as a humble beggar. Whereas I wished you naked and in my arms, I bared myself to you first. Not my body, but my soul, and I told you the truth of my affliction.~
@1319 = ~Every word of yours was as a raindrop descending onto a man stranded in the Calimshan Desert - a miracle and life. I shed your clothes, and they lay scattered, as I watched you. For all my pleasurable efforts to bring you to just that state, it was a sudden experience of beauty, as if I beheld a masterfully cut statue hidden behind a turn of the path in the garden maze.~
@1320 = ~I was reduced for a moment to a babe then, reaching for your bosom with my lips. That gentlest touch turned me into a grown man again, and my hands quested to help my overwhelmed eyes see your desires. I found many and tried to fulfill each, while gasping at your gifts to me. It was a joyous race, which exhausted us and left us breathless.~
@1321 = ~I have loved you again and again since. It was never the same joy, but the changes brought by it filled me with insatiable curiosity. Like a nightingale that cannot help itself but sing sweetly at the descent of the sun, begging to stay with it as it hides itself, so I cannot see you lowering yourself into our blankets without asking the same of you, who are my sun.~
@1322 = ~*You pretend being asleep.*~
@1323 = ~Shut up, dive in, and do your thing, nightingale.~
@1324 = ~My nightingale, on the other side of the horizon I am greeted by an early morning bird... to which I have pledged my shiny perfection tonight.~
@1325 = ~You sang sweetly, nightingale. Stay with me awhile and delay the sunrise.~
@1326 = ~*You laugh and pull Coran into your bedroll.*~
@1327 = ~Tonight I wish to be alone, Coran, but not because I do not love you. I will make it up to you later.~
@1328 = ~*You reply to Coran in kind, and after an hour or so of talking, consent to let him lie with you.*~
@1329 = ~*You reply to Coran in kind, and after an hour or so of talking, reject him.*~
@1330 = ~Luck be a Lady, <CHARNAME>, and it seems to me that you are both my lady and my luck.~
@1331 = ~Why do you say this?~
@1332 = ~So, you finally figured that one out, eh?~
@1333 = ~How can I be anybody's luck, Coran? Look at my life... it seems to be a string of unhappy coincidences.~
@1334 = ~With my heritage, I am more like to be someone's Lady of Death, Coran.~
@1335 = ~*smile and stroke Namara's head* I think that title rightfully belongs to this little lady.~
@1336 = ~Because I desire to. Since meeting you, I have been through hair-raising adventures, and amazingly, have managed to keep my head attached to my shoulders. There is ever a coin to buy meat and wine, and to add to that, I have done something... well... good.~
@1337 = ~Your idea of Lady Luck is a combination of a healer, a preacher, and a bank.~
@1338 = ~Thank... thank you, I guess.~
@1339 = ~And since meeting you, I have had to restrain you from fits of recklessness, wasting money, and abandoning your own child. *sigh* And what have I received in exchange for that, hmm?~
@1340 = ~Yes, we are lucky that it has all come to pass. But aren't you forgetting-~
@1341 = ~Yes, my dearest.~
@1342 = ~*sigh* Since meeting you, I have had to restrain you from fits of suicidal bravery, wasting coin, and abandoning your own child. *sigh* And what have I received in exchange for that, hmm?~
@1343 = ~So, do you have any other stunning revelations?~
@1344 = ~Unhappy coincidences? By Hanali's golden heart! How many times you should have been good and dead, and yet you have escaped with your life? And crossing that little bridge by the Lodge, just when I was watching the dark waters of the Cloakwood Creek - was not that a good fortune?~
@1345 = ~Good fortune!? Since meeting you, I have had to restrain you from fits of recklessness, wasting coin, and abandoning your own child. *sigh* And what have I received in exchange for this, hmm?~
@1346 = ~You are right! I was sulking for no good reason.~
@1347 = ~Uh-huh. Meeting *you* surely is compensation for being exiled from my home-town, having a madman kill my foster father and send assassins after me, and all the blood I've had to spill while trying to keep alive. If that's how life rewards us, I'd be probably better off dying on the spot.~
@1348 = ~You have an amazing talent for finding a pearl in the midden heap.~
@1349 = ~I have looked into the eyes of Lady Death, sweetling. I must say she is much older and much more ragged than you. Not to mention that she isn't at all beautiful.~
@1350 = ~I did see her too, Coran... in the mirror. She was young and pretty, her cloak was lined with shiny fur and embroidered brightly. Yet she was death... and anyone who comes too close to her will be burned by the fires of the Hells. Consider yourself warned, Coran.~
@1351 = ~And am I... beautiful?~
@1352 = ~I met with her because of you... It was the greatest surprise in my life. When I saw the child, my heart went cold, for thoughts of what you were going to do.~
@1353 = ~I was expecting you to berate me for Namara's existence every time you were cross, turning our sweet companionship into the unbearable.~
@1354 = ~Yet, you insisted that I should do something... good. I was lucky that it was you by my side that day or, as the Seldarine know, I would have acted like a selfish brat.~
@1355 = ~It was... a tempting thing to do. But it was not going to solve anything, and there was a child in need of a father.~
@1356 = ~I am not of the Seldarine, but I know that you would not have acted as a selfish brat, Coran. There is honor in you. Sooner or later, you would have done the right thing.~
@1357 = ~That does it! Fatherhood has turned you into a scatterbrain! You are making me sick, speaking like that. Will you refuse to steal next???!!!~
@1358 = ~Why should I be cross about something that you did long ago? I knew that you did not come to me whole, and accepted it. Just do not give me a *real* reason to become angry with you.~
@1359 = ~No, sweetling, it is not. Luck is not a combination of things. It is a whole... entity. It is either with a man, or not.~
@1360 = ~I am glad that you understand that.~
@1361 = ~I have no idea what you mean.~
@1362 = ~Coran, if you don't shut down this fountain of meaningless words, I will be forced to close your mouth with a kiss.~
@1363 = ~Why do you sound so uncertain? Do you not think that crossing that little bridge by the Lodge just when I was watching the dark waters of the Cloakwood Creek was a manifestation of a good fortune?~
@1364 = ~Good fortune!? Since meeting you, I have had to restrain you from fits of recklessness, wasting coin, and abandoning your own child. *sigh* And what do I received in exchange for that, hmm?~
@1365 = ~Uh-huh. Meeting you surely is compensation for being exiled from my home-town, having a madman kill my foster father and send assassins after me, and all the blood I have had to spill trying to stay alive. If that's how life rewards us, I'd be probably better off dying on the spot.~
@1366 = ~Me... since as my luck has it, you do want me. And, I dare say, I am a sweeter dish now than the day you bumped into me on that bridge by Cloakwood Lodge.~
@1367 = ~I think you are a much plainer dish now, actually, but that cannot be helped. A man cannot be a charming daredevil and take care of his whelp at the same time.~
@1368 = ~Yeah, very sweet. In fact, if you go any sweeter on me, I am likely to throw up.~
@1369 = ~You are just the same as you were then. Circumstances change, but people do not.~
@1370 = ~*smile proudly* A job well done.~
@1371 = ~No, of course not... You see, if I had done enough to make the whole Order of the Radiant Heart go permanently green with envy, caught a ride on a red dragon's tail, and feasted at a halfling's table - all in one day - I still would not consider myself lucky, if you were not there.~
@1372 = ~Just one more thing... <CHARNAME>, I love you.~
@1373 = ~Do not sulk, my Lady of Luck. We have adventures, and we are in love. What else could there be to live for?~
@1374 = ~Do I not bring at least a little bit of happiness into your life?~
@1375 = ~No, just problems.~
@1376 = ~*You place your forefingers an inch apart* About that much.~
@1377 = ~You do. I was sulking for no good reason.~
@1378 = ~I was never afraid to love, and never afraid of the one I loved. And I am not going to start now.~
@1379 = ~*hiss* More the fool you are.~
@1380 = ~*hug Coran tightly* I always wanted to love a brave man, and I now do.~
@1381 = ~If I had not been in love with you already, I would have fallen for you for these few words alone.~
@1382 = ~As you wish.~
@1383 = ~Yes. You are the most beautiful woman I have ever met.~
@1384 = ~And a father in need of a child, even if he was stupid enough not to realize that.~
@1385 = ~You... you see me that way? As an honorable man?~
@1386 = ~Well, one cannot know for sure, but I have hopes for you.~
@1387 = ~Coran, I'd rather not talk about it right now.~
@1388 = ~Not exactly paladin-like honorable, but close enough.~
@1389 = ~*chuckling uncomfortably* Frankly, I was thinking that I might be able to earn enough by hiring out as a mercenary, now that I am better with my sword...~
@1390 = ~Then I will keep talking... Hmm... I should have listened closer when old Echtelion taught about entities...~
@1391 = ~*grins* Oh, I should try harder then.~
@1392 = ~That's... that's such a strange thing to hear from a woman.~
@1393 = ~<CHARNAME>, you have never asked, but do you want to know about Briel?~
@1394 = ~Only if this story is different than all others.~
@1395 = ~*nod*~
@1396 = ~Why would I? I have always known that you did not come to me whole, and I have accepted it. Please, spare me the details.~
@1397 = ~I do not want to dwell on your past... victories.~
@1398 = ~If you do not mind the telling.~
@1399 = ~It was different. I was always the one to go for merry women with easy wit and little fear. Brielbara was not the type at all.~
@1400 = ~I was broke then, and had to resort to cutting purses in the market square - the most miserable kind of thievery, if you ask me. So I was meddling in the crowds, keeping my eyes open for a well-to-do merchant, and the City Watchers...~
@1401 = ~You sound hurt, Lady Luck.~
@1402 = ~I assure you, I am not.~
@1403 = ~I sound jealous.~
@1404 = ~Of course I am. She mothered your child, Coran, despite knowing that her infidelity would be discovered, since the baby would be born half-elven. There must have been *something* in your relationship...~
@1405 = ~I would not call it a victory.~
@1406 = ~Really? Then what was it?~
@1407 = ~Whatever you call it, I do not want to hear about it.~
@1408 = ~Coran, do have some decency and spare Brielbara's modesty.~
@1409 = ~You know how in the buzz and swirl of the crowd, a single creature or object suddenly catch your attention and you focus on them, as if nothing else exists? I saw Briel this way - a woman in long robes, with her head and face draped by a silken shawl, so that only her eyes were visible.~
@1410 = ~Now, that's something you cannot resist! A mystery woman.~
@1411 = ~Your imagination, however, quickly added details...~
@1412 = ~I think... I do not have resolve enough to hear out the rest of it.~
@1413 = ~I see the ever-unasked question in your eyes, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps I am simply mad, but I think it would be easier if I told it to you... well, for me at least.~
@1414 = ~You are right. Tell me that... saga.~
@1415 = ~I do not want to hear about it.~
@1416 = ~Coran, do have some decency and spare Brielbara's modesty. Or what's left of it.~
@1417 = ~I think it would be easier if I told it all to you... then, at least, you would know the truth, instead of guessing at what has happened.~
@1418 = ~Oh, by Hanali Celanil! I am not bragging about it to a mate in a tavern over a mug of ale! I am trying to tell you the truth, so you stop guessing at what has happened! It's eating at you, I know!~
@1419 = ~I prefer not knowing, Coran. Please, respect my wish.~
@1420 = ~You presume too much. The matter does not concern me in the least.~
@1421 = ~*grins* It is almost scary how well you know me.~
@1422 = ~Brielbara stood in front of the flower merchant and looked at the blooms for a while. And I looked at her... Then she startled and hurried away. Something in this startle endeared her to me. I did not have the time to light-finger a bud, and only enough money to buy a single red flower. I did so, and ran after her.~
@1423 = ~When I offered her the flower, there was surprise and gratitude in her eyes, but she shook her head and told me that she was married. 'Well,' I replied, 'so much the better. I am for making you happy, and your husband - to take care of all your other needs.'~
@1424 = ~The next thing I knew, I was standing in the middle of the busy street in Baldur's Gate, hugging a strange woman who sobbed into my shoulder. In a moment, she wiped her tears away and straightened. You met Yago... he was quite apt at devouring the very last shred of happiness from his wife. Brielbara was determined to snatch out of his jaws whatever she could. Rarely have I met a woman who plunged into an affair with such decisiveness and passion.~
@1425 = ~After a while, being fed up with seeing bruises all over Brielbara's body and listening to what her husband did to her, I suggested that I spirit her away from Yago. At first she was quite fascinated by the prospect, but when she understood that I would neither stay with her long after our escape, nor settle down in a remote corner of the world, she told me that a human's life is too short to make new starts.~
@1426 = ~A good dose of despair in the gaiety of our meetings finally wore me down, and I left.~
@1427 = ~So, it was the memory of happiness, which prompted her to keep Namara.~
@1428 = ~I would have run away with you, even if I knew it would only last for a day...~
@1429 = ~Well, thank you for sharing. Let us go now.~
@1430 = ~And that, in turn, made Yago try to kill her... so that even past joy turned to ashes for Brielbara. You know, I am glad that we got rid of this man.~
@1431 = ~*Coran embraces you and kisses your hair lightly.* I know, fireheart.~
@1432 = ~I received a message from Brielbara, <CHARNAME>. Her affairs are settled, and she'd like to take Namara back.~
@1433 = ~Godspeed then. And Coran... take some of the party's gold. Brielbara will look more favorably on you if you don't arrive empty-handed.~
@1434 = ~I think that giving the child back is not a good idea.~
@1435 = ~I am not letting you out of my sight, especially to go see your former mistress and a mother of your child! Either I am coming with you, or Brielbara can pick up Namara on her own. If she found a way of communicating with you here, she can find a way to travel!~
@1436 = ~Of course. Will you... will you be coming back?~
@1437 = ~You would trust a thief with party's gold?~
@1438 = ~I would trust *you* with party's gold.~
@1439 = ~You have earned your share of the booty, Coran.~
@1440 = ~On second thought... will 1000 gold suffice?~
@1441 = ~I know for myself that there is honor among thieves.~
@1442 = ~And why is that, Lady Luck?~
@1443 = ~Because I said so. Namara and you stay with me.~
@1444 = ~Well, you seem to really love Namara, and Brielbara is likely to suggest yet again for you to stay. It is the right thing for you to-~
@1445 = ~You can go, if you promise to come back.~
@1446 = ~You... you may go, just remember your vows to me.~
@1447 = ~I love you, Lady Luck. I love you with all my heart, but I will not be pinned to your skirt!~
@1448 = ~My heart will guide me, as always. Look for me in the 'Sturgeon.'~
@1449 = ~I swore a solemn vow, that no matter what transpires, I should return to you. By the sun and the stars and the twelve winds, I swore it. Do you doubt my words?~
@1450 = ~I do not care what words you said!~
@1451 = ~I am sorry, my love. I just did not know that it should be tested so... soon. Do not tarry now. I shall await your return.~
@1452 = ~I do not know how binding such a vow is... from a man like you, Coran... Your moods change like clouds in the sky. I just... do not know what to expect of you.~
@1453 = ~I do not know how binding such a vow is... from a man like you, Coran...Your moods change like clouds in the sky. I just... do not know what to expect of you.~
@1454 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. But what... what did you mean about Briel liking me?~
@1455 = ~Coran, you sired Namara on Brielbara, and you are quite fond of the child. It is the right thing for you to-~
@1456 = ~Coran, do not make it more difficult than necessary. I... I do not think that you are coming back.~
@1457 = ~I'll let you figure it out on your own, elf.~
@1458 = ~It is more than generous of you, <CHARNAME>. Look for me in the 'Sturgeon.'~
@1459 = ~My Lady Luck. *Coran holds you close and whispers into your ear.* You and me is the right thing... the whole thing. If you believe me, I'll be waiting for you in the 'Sturgeon.'~
@1460 = ~If you did not take my vows seriously, then I shall follow the guidance of my heart.~
@1461 = ~If you did not take my vows seriously, then I shall follow the guidance of my heart. Look for me in the 'Sturgeon.'~
@1462 = ~I think you doubt that I shall be back.~
@1463 = ~<CHARNAME>? *Coran wraps his hands around you and presses his forehead against your neck* I feel a bit odd without Namara.~
@1464 = ~You will soon get used to it, Coran. ~
@1465 = ~Ah, but look on the bright side: we only have to worry about curious grown-ups. ~
@1466 = ~*Stroke Coran's hair* ~
@1467 = ~Will I? ~
@1468 = ~True. *Coran lifts his head and starts arranging your hair in a semicircle around your face* ~
@1469 = ~Do not move. You look too beautiful to change anything - the rays of sun frame your face. ~
@1470 = ~*You sit up and muss your hair* I have changed and I am still beautiful, love. ~
@1471 = ~*Lie still and smile suggestively* Are you sure you do not want me to move? ~
@1472 = ~I am *simply* beautiful? Coran, are you running out of compliments? ~
@1473 = ~*Look at Coran attentively* Coran? Are you trying to say something? ~
@1474 = ~You moved away. *Sighs* You are farther from me and do not look the way I made you look, but I love you just the same.~
@1475 = ~*Lick your lips slowly and teasingly* Then prove it, elf. ~
@1476 = ~Coran, I am too tired to assist you in soul-searching tonight.~
@1477 = ~And I thought I'd get my easy-going and light-spirited lover back, with Namara gone! ~
@1478 = ~*Laughs* Seductress... it always amazes me how little a gesture you need to have me trembling with desire for your delicious body.~
@1479 = ~*Sighs* I never speak plain, do I? You know, I look at you now, and I see a beauty. And so I say. There is another thing I feel.~
@1480 = ~*Coran touches your brow lightly* Sweetling... I am at odds with myself. ~
@1481 = ~*Coran lifts his head and looks at you with a small smile* What about you? One day, will you become a shadow and a hole in my heart?~
@1482 = ~*In silence you find Coran's lips with yours and kiss him passionately, trying to put into that kiss the promise of happiness.* ~
@1483 = ~Coran, you should not dread that day, you should welcome it, when it comes. The darkest shadow over us is that of my destiny. The more you love me, the longer you stay with me, the worse you will be hurt. ~
@1484 = ~Coran, I am too tired to assist you in soul-searching tonight. ~
@1485 = ~Why... why are you so sure that it will happen? ~
@1486 = ~There is no reason for grief now, so why court future trouble, Coran? ~
@1487 = ~*Quietly* My life is shorter than yours, elf, so I cannot promise you not to die. But while I live, I'll stay with you. ~
@1488 = ~I am afraid, <CHARNAME>. I dread the day when you will become a shadow and a hole in my heart.~
@1489 = ~You will walk the roads beside me then? You will wake in my arms for many mornings to come? You will not be afraid to bear my son and rear him with me? ~
@1490 = ~Coran... please... people just do not ask questions like that after a hard day! Let me think on it. ~
@1491 = ~Yes, yes, yes and yes. Though I cannot guarantee that it will be a son. ~
@1492 = ~*Sob* It's the first time... ever... someone is proposing to me and I have no idea what I am... supposed to say. ~
@1493 = ~Erm... let's go... slow here. We have already started on the travelling together bit, so we can work on the waking-in-arms-morningly part next. ~
@1494 = ~Sweetling, if I told you that I am not afraid of omens and your grim Sire's hand, what then? ~
@1495 = ~I am not courting trouble. I am courting <CHARNAME>. If I was to tell you, that I cannot see you gone, as I have seen every other woman in my life, what then? ~
@1496 = ~*Sighs* I will learn patience then, the first of all the virtues that I do not have. ~
@1497 = ~A daughter would be just as nice, and at least I have some idea of what to expect.~
@1498 = ~Right you are. *Coran opens his arms and whispers* Come here, sweetling.~
@1499 = ~*Among the inn's furnishings there are sometimes things that do not belong in the simple rooms. The standing mirror in the corner of your chamber is not posh enough for a palace, perhaps. Its frame is not gilded, nor inlaid with mother-of-pearl or gems, but whoever had carved it was a master of his trade. The polished wood around the looking glass tells a tale of a war, the figurines fighting, dying and fleeing.*~
@1500 = ~*Coran comes up, as you thoughtfully study your reflection in the mirror. He stands by you, a palm on your shoulder, then makes another step forward and gently kisses your reflection on the lips.*~
@1501 = ~Whatever did you did that for, Coran?~
@1502 = ~Ah!~
@1503 = ~*Run your fingers over the mirror's frame* Do you recognize the story, Coran? These are elves.~
@1504 = ~You've apparently missed the target. And to think that I thought you a sharpshooter!~
@1505 = ~It's an elegant way to express love, my Lady Luck. Or so I was taught. Perhaps you have no taste for such subtleness, but in the days when you would not let me touch you, I consoled myself with caressing your shadow or drinking water touched by your reflection.~
@1506 = ~A folly.~
@1507 = ~And who is the better kisser? A shadow or the one who casts it?~
@1508 = ~I can conjure mirror images of myself, if such games please you.~
@1509 = ~But those days are long gone.~
@1510 = ~And bedded every woman you could sweet talk into it!~
@1511 = ~In the days when you would not let me touch you, I consoled myself with caressing your shadow or drinking water touched by your reflection.~
@1512 = ~These are the Crown Wars, Lady Luck. The proud Golden Elves against the rest of the Elvendom. Oh, sweetling, do not torment me with further questions. Be damned the hand that carved it, no matter how skillful! These are black times in the histories of the Tel'Quess, and there are no memories bright enough to shield us from the darkness of what had happened then.~
@1513 = ~I am sorry. I did not know that you felt so strongly about it. *You turn Coran's head away from the mirror and catch his lower lip between yours.*~
@1514 = ~Then let us talk of something else. Why did you kiss the mirror?~
@1515 = ~But why are you so upset? The Golden Elves started the war against the other Elven Nations. Big deal. Humans fight among each other all the time!~
@1516 = ~A distinction well-deserved, even if I say so myself!~
@1517 = ~It was and I am not cured.~
@1518 = ~*He turns from the mirror and seizes you. In the silvery looking glass, the clothes slide down from your reflection and Coran's...*~
@1519 = ~The one who casts the shadow. The one who makes the whole world her reflection.~
@1520 = ~*swallows* I can't say that this idea did not cross my mind, Lady Luck, but I could not be sure that you'd not consider me kissing your projection to be an act of unfaithfulness, and somehow, somehow, I think that you'd geld me, if I ever -~
@1521 = ~I'd like to relieve you of your doubts, Coran. *smile sweetly* If you ever take another woman in your bed, I'd have to either sleep with another man, or kill you. Seeing that I am not eager to make love with someone else, I'd kill you.~
@1522 = ~*You turn Coran's head away from the mirror and catch his lower lip between yours.*~
@1523 = ~I would not consider this an act of unfaithfulness. But I am worried about your mannish pride. Virile you may be, but I am quite a powerful mage, and am capable of creating several projections, each wanting the same thing that I do...~
@1524 = ~Who do you think is the better kisser, me or my shadows?~
@1525 = ~*At length, Coran reclaims his lip, turns from the mirror and seizes you. In the silvery looking glass, the clothes slide down from your reflection and his...*~
@1526 = ~Indeed. *He turns, but his hands stop a hairbreadth away from your shoulders. He goes to his knees, slowly, gracefully, his hands caressing the air, around, but never touching your body.*~
@1527 = ~*His are a thief's fingers. You never felt his touch, you never saw the dagger, but in the silvery looking glass, the clothes slide down from your reflection, both the laces and the fabric cut, precisely and quickly.*~
@1528 = ~You are being merciless, sweetling. *He crosses the room and swings over the windowsill into the street.*~
@1529 = ~...and thought only of you while doing it. All of them, no matter how they looked, evoked your dear image in my heart. It's called substitution love, Lady Luck, and I have never felt that way before. Nor do I want to.~
@1530 = ~*He reaches for you, but his hands stop a hairbreadth away from your shoulders. He goes to his knees, slowly, gracefully, his hands caressing the air, around, but never touching your body.*~
@1531 = ~A compelling argument, Lady Luck. Only you don't need threats to keep me from the arms of other women.~
@1532 = ~My mannish pride? Oh, I can do a thing or two well!~
@1533 = ~Two things came to my mind, while I was looking at you just now, Lady Luck.~
@1534 = ~The last time you said something to that extent in a dungeon, my love, we ended up in a trapped room, waiting for the others to get you a potion so you could disarm an ancient-looking snare, with nothing better to do than to... *blush*~
@1535 = ~*smile* Yes?~
@1536 = ~Coran!~
@1537 = ~*grins* And did we use the time well!~
@1538 = ~But, <CHARNAME>, I swear, I was only going to offer you thoughts this time...~
@1539 = ~I think that I can live without any more of your insights, Coran.~
@1540 = ~The one was that you are the brightest of the holy stars that this elf knows. And that your shine is not diminished amidst the darkness, dust, old skeletons, ruins and carrion crawlers.~
@1541 = ~And the second one?~
@1542 = ~I think that I can live without any more of your insights, Coran.~
@1543 = ~*Your voice echoes off the walls, and your lover's name is repeated a few times, fainter and fainter*~
@1544 = ~*Coran's breath tickles your neck as he whispers* Ah, my love, it is exhilarating when you call on me with such persistence.~
@1545 = ~*You spin around, readying a retort, but the look in his eyes stills your tongue.*~
@1546 = ~*You need but one gentle finger-stroke to confirm your guess, so you whisper back to him even quieter* Ah, my love, it is so exhilarating to know that there is a man who can be so easily fooled by such a call.~
@1547 = ~The second one is... Seldarine, but I am grateful for the gift of infravision!~
@1548 = ~Elaborate.~
@1549 = ~*sigh* I think that I can live without any more of your insights, Coran.~
@1550 = ~*Coran's light laughter ripples through the air, and you see amusement writ on his features every time he looks at you for a while.*~
@1551 = ~*He bites your neck very gently and lets you go.*~
@1552 = ~Because I can see your beautiful body as easily as when you lie in the morning light near me...~
@1553 = ~I am not a man to miss an opportunity, Lady Luck. *He presses his lips to yours for a lightning-quick moment.*~
@1554 = ~Do you think we can halt for a few moments?~
@1555 = ~Yes, Coran.~
@1556 = ~We might, if you give me a good reason.~
@1557 = ~My love, the beauty of the forest affects me as well, but our tasks require haste.~
@1558 = ~Then come with me. I've been here before. Behind this row of trees there is a clearing.~
@1559 = ~Here, take off your shoes.~
@1560 = ~Just shoes?~
@1561 = ~We wasted enough time already, Coran. I am sorry, but we need to go back.~
@1562 = ~Please, come... The grass there is soft and laced with flowers. In the morning like this, it will be covered with dew, just right for walking barefoot.~
@1563 = ~We shall do that then. It will revive our tired feet.~
@1564 = ~So, you wish me to come with you to a clearing and take my shoes off? That's it?~
@1565 = ~I'm sorry, my love, but we can't do that just now. Later, perhaps.~
@1566 = ~I've been here before. Behind this row of trees there is a clearing, and the grass there is soft and laced with flowers. In the morning like this it will be covered with dew, just right for walking barefoot.~
@1567 = ~I've been here before, and there is a clearing behind this row of trees... I would like to go there with you, not march in. There is something special about the place.~
@1568 = ~You made me curious. I will come, Coran.~
@1569 = ~And still, we can't do that just now. Later, perhaps.~
@1570 = ~Just shoes.~
@1571 = ~See how soft the grass is here, how it is glistening with dew in this early hour? It is just right for walking barefoot.~
@1572 = ~It is pleasant. Myriad chilled droplets prickle my skin... Where are you leading me?~
@1573 = ~It will revive our tired feet.~
@1574 = ~See how soft the grass is here, how it is glistening with dew in this early hour? It is just right for walking barefoot.~
@1575 = ~You can't go on like that, unwinding only when I take you in my arms at night, <CHARNAME>. Please, give it a thought.~
@1576 = ~And it will give us pleasure. Come with me, Lady Luck.~
@1577 = ~I would have you to undo your hair as well, but taking your shoes off will suffice. It will give us pleasure. Come with me, Lady Luck.~
@1578 = ~Oh, my dear. When will you learn that in some things, 'later' means 'never'? There will never again be a morning like this, with the sun warm, the grass green, the dew perfect for walking on barefoot. Will you not come?~
@1579 = ~You are convincing. I am coming... Oh! It is pleasant. Myriad chilled droplets prickle my skin... Where are you leading me?~
@1580 = ~*shake your head negatively*~
@1581 = ~Good. Now take off your shoes. See how soft the grass is here, how it is glistening with dew in this early hour? It is just right for walking barefoot.~
@1582 = ~It will revive our tired feet.~
@1583 = ~Not far.~
@1584 = ~*The lilacs grow on the forest edge, perhaps wild, perhaps the last reminder of a cabin that used to be here. The tall bushes are in bloom, heavy with purple and white bunches of flowers.*~
@1585 = ~*Coran leans a branch over, and so that the fragrant panicles are right in front of you. He burrows his face in one, and you see that he drinks the dew off the flowers.*~
@1586 = ~Lilac wine... care to try?~
@1587 = ~*Instead of an answer you take one of the panicles between your palms and smile at him before lowering your lips onto the blossoms.* I have done that before, Coran, last spring, in fact... Ages ago, it seems.~
@1588 = ~Yes, I'd like to try.~
@1589 = ~*You shake your head and walk out of the clearing. Coran watches you, his face still wet and one purple flower at the corner of his mouth.*~
@1590 = ~So it will. *Cold dew and silky grass touch your skin as you walk after Coran.*~
@1591 = ~Where are you leading me?~
@1592 = ~*You shake your head and walk out of the clearing.~
@1593 = ~*He proffers you a branch. A cascade of crystal drops takes flight, when he moves it, but the panicle is still full of chilled lilac wine - the dew water scented by the flowers, bitter-sweet with the nectar.*~
@1594 = ~*You let the blossoms go and kiss Coran.*~
@1595 = ~Th-thank you, my love...~
@1596 = ~Mmm... the best I ever tasted.~
@1597 = ~*You shake your head and walk out of the clearing.*~
@1598 = ~We have the same taste in wine, Lady Luck. But do not be so sad...~
@1599 = ~Here, make a wish. *He finds a flower with five petals among the thousand of the four-pointed ones.* If you eat it, it will come true...~
@1600 = ~Very well...~
@1601 = ~What nonsense! *But you take the flower from his wet palm and put it in your mouth.*~
@1602 = ~What nonsense! *You shake your head and walk out of the clearing.*~
@1603 = ~As a druid, I feel that I need to dispel this childish belief. Fife petals are a natural occurrence, resulting from the flowers growing together or mutating. This was used by the gardeners of Chauntlea to cultivate varieties with luxurious double flowers and -~
@1604 = ~*His lips are cold and taste the same as yours. They taste like the first chill of the morning, like the dew-laden flowers, and like the first white light of the sun.*~
@1605 = ~*Coran releases the branch, which shoots up, showering both of you. He embraces your waist, pulls you close, and kisses you. His lips are cold and taste the same as yours. They taste like the first chill of the morning, like the dew-laden flowers, and like the first white light of the sun.*~
@1606 = ~Of course, Lady Luck, of course.~
@1607 = ~Sweetling...~
@1608 = ~No. My love, love of my life... *Coran presses you against his chest, and hides his face in your hair, whispering:*~
@1609 = ~Mela en'coiamin, amin uuma merna te, sina dagor, ananta amin sinta thaliolle ar'soora lle. Ilyamenie. Tira ten'rashwe, wilwarinamin... amin anta lle. Amin mela lle, peta lle sinta.~
@1610 = ~(Love of my life, I do not want it, this battle, and yet I know your strength, and I follow you. Always. Be careful, my butterfly... I need you. I love you. But you know.)~
@1611 = ~O, Seldarine, I sound like a... like a paladin. *The moments pass, before he releases you with a soft moan and adds with a crooked grin:*~
@1612 = ~Luck be with the romantics.~
@1613 = ~A'maelamin <CHARNAME>, cormamin lindua ele lle...~
@1614 = ~*smile* And so does mine heart sing at the sight of you.~
@1615 = ~Coran, I conclude from the shine in your eyes that you are happy to see me, but what you are saying sounds elvish to me.~
@1616 = ~It better be good news... what are you saying?~
@1617 = ~Ah, a'maelamin, I have missed you so! *Coran catches you in his arms and swirls you around.*~
@1618 = ~*laugh* It's like you have never been gone!~
@1619 = ~Put me down! Put me DOWN! And fall back in line, you impossible, silly, terrible- *kiss Coran*~
@1620 = ~You know, Coran, how they say: 'Out of sight, out of mind?' I... I do not-~
@1621 = ~Ah, I am sorry, I was talking to you in my thoughts all the way here and slipped to elvish inadvertently. My heart sings to see thee, beloved. Hmm... it sounds more... natural in elvish than in Common. Never mind! *Coran catches you in his arms and swirls you around.*~
@1622 = ~How have you been, my love? Unhurt? And not seduced by some irresponsible vagabond? I want to know of every moment I have missed...~
@1623 = ~Do not try to explain. The flaming Nine Hells, woman, you did not believe a word I was saying, did you? Ah, well, bugger it all.~
@1624 = ~Boo says everyone is, <CHARNAME>. But how can that be if I am not asleep, Boo? And neither are the valiant woman <CHARNAME> and the good elf Coran? *You hear random giggling from the rest of the party.*~
