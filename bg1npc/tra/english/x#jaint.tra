@0    = ~I'm not giving any gold to a stupid slave! Out of my way.~
@1    = ~Here, take the gold you need, and get yourself and the others away from here, as soon as possible.~
@2    = ~Do not listen to the babbling of that ignorant wayward child. Here is the money you need, now lead the rest of your men outside, while we keep the Black Talons busy. As for you, <CHARNAME>... I have plenty of things to say about this little quip of yours, and none of them good. Gorion would feel nothing but shame.~
@3    = ~Thank you, ma'am, thank you very much! I wish you well, and hope that you can bring an end to this stinking operation.~
@4    = ~Yes, what is it you want? Have you dealt with the druid yet?~
@5    = ~Err, no, we will be back.~
@6    = ~We met Voltine. She says it is *you* who scares the girls, and we believe her story. I think you should leave at once, old man.~
@7    = ~What? What impertinence is this? How foolish you must be to threaten a magic wielder! Never mind... I will dispose of you, if that is what it takes for me to maintain my little... hobby.~
@8    = ~On behalf of my group, I apologize for the intrusion. I swear on my oath of druidry that intruding on other people's privacy is not a hobby of mine, nor of my companions. Perhaps, to even out this misunderstanding, we could deal with this Gervisse of yours?~
@9    = ~Hmm, another druid here in the city. How... odd. I suppose you could try speaking with him; I do not see how you could make things worse. I have tried to drive him away, but in return he now spreads ugly rumors about me. If you rid this neighborhood of him, I would be grateful.~
@10   = ~It appears that we have done a good deed and earned ourselves an ally, <CHARNAME>. Ah, but forgive my manners, Voltine... My name is Jaheira, a druid of Cloakwood. Will you be staying here in the city?~
@11   = ~I am afraid not, Jaheira. I hear that the bandits of Larswood have been routed... I... fled to the city after it was clear that I would be unable to protect nature from their intrusion. I think it is time for me to return and seek to heal the damage they have done, as well as try and earn redemption in the eyes of the Oak Father.~
@12   = ~Then I wish you farewell and good luck, sister of the woods.~
@13   = ~Yes... a graveyard shift. And all because *some* people would not let two little girls fall asleep!~
@14   = ~Yes, it might not be wise to let her wander around, if only for her own safety. And we shall see if helping her was right, after all. If she proves us wrong... well, then I truly pity her.~
@15   = ~Save your pity for our foes!~
@16   = ~I do not feel guilty about killing this fool with his misguided sense of justice, but I am left to question whether saving this drow was a good enough reason for that. Whatever the answer might be, we better dispose of this corpse, lest we earn ourselves more trouble with the Flaming Fist.~
@17   = ~Your underlings lack... respect for you, rivvin, to speak out of turn... pfft...~
@18   = ~It is very likely that she possesses a cruel and evil heart, and I suppose that no one will cry for her. But still, I am a little unsettled about the ease with which you took the decision, <CHARNAME>.~
@19   = ~Hmph. <CHARNAME>, be careful around our new companion. I know her type... do not trust her easily, or, one day, you will find her gone missing, together with our funds. I would normally trust you to make your own judgment, but from the way she was looking at you, I thought a warning would be appropriate.~
@20   = ~What's your problem, daaarling?~
@21   = ~Thank you for your kind words, Entillis, but right now I will not have anyone taking care of me. I can stand up for myself... life goes on, and we shall see what comes of it.~
@22   = ~Entillis! Between your and Khalid's coddling, I really do not need anyone else looking out for me! Must I be made out to be a simpering, helpless waif who needs constant support of the men to survive?~
@23   = ~My d-dear, I know that you are anything b-but helpless...~
@24   = ~Wise words, Khalid. Never forget them.~
@25   = ~It appears my dear friends Khalid and Jaheira are with the Harpers. I am honored and more than a little frightened to find that I warrant such attention. One of their compatriots, a kindly old gent named Entillis Fulsom, seems well-acquainted with my ongoing investigations into the Iron Throne. He has recommended to me the assistance of Scar and Duke Eltan, two men associated with the honorable Flaming Fist Mercenaries, here in Baldur's Gate... Harpers, yet... Sigh, why doesn't anyone ever tell me these things?~
@26   = ~Nature has been offended here, and the aggressors have been punished severely for their foolishness... Perhaps too severely, but 'tis not for me to judge. Let us leave, <CHARNAME>... let us leave and allow this unfortunate being to die in peace.~
@27   = ~If you are looking for someone to remove these sirines for you, I suggest you look elsewhere. However, I can understand the resentment... you would do well to understand that it was no act of malice on their part. You can not blame them for something that is their nature.~
@28   = ~A mage is keeping a nymph enslaved. We should look into this, <CHARNAME>, these are worrying words for me to hear. And be careful for what you wish, woman... once the world were rid of all men, you might realize how much you miss them.~
@29   = ~A mage is keeping a nymph enslaved. We should look into this, <CHARNAME>, these are worrying words for me to hear. But you are wrong to think that all men are callous brutes, woman. Ah, but I should not boast about my fortune.~
@30   = ~*blush* Ah, Jaheira... you... you shouldn't have...~
@31   = ~To help would mean to intrude in the cycle of nature, but... by Silvanus, this is the life of a child we are talking of! I would make an exception in this case, and, I am sure, nature will not protest.~
@32   = ~Yes, let us follow him, <CHARNAME>... but do not lose sight of him. Once we are outside, I will not hesitate to slay him, and, I trust, you will help.~
@33   = ~*Neb cackles, but it is impossible to discern if it is because he overheard Jaheira's private words, or simply due to his madness.*~
@34   = ~Perhaps... when we have more time, we could see what can be done about the fate of this child. It would be wrong to allow her to wander through the streets at night. An orphanage is one option to consider.~
@35   = ~O, no... they... they won't let me have Angel. And Angel... nobody in the whole world loves me, but my Angel.~
@36   = ~Be wary, <CHARNAME>. I would suggest freeing this nymph, but not to exchange her for a petty reward... the creature's place is amongst her own kin, in nature. Nymphs have very close affinity with nature, and within the walls of the city, they would perish very swiftly.~
@37   = ~I have not figured out yet if you truly are evil, or just plain moronic. But it is time to set the speculations aside. Whatever your nature, you were never Gorion's child... and this is where your path ends.~
@38   = ~We c-can't let this c-creature be enslaved... or worse! J-Jaheira, I am with you!~
@39   = ~The woodland being will go free.~
@40   = ~*sigh*~
@41   = ~Perhaps it is ignorance in your actions more than evil intent, <CHARNAME>... but regardless, I will not let this transaction commence. Silvanus demands you will not take that nymph, mage!~
@42   = ~I do not agree with our course of action. You would hand over a sentient being in slavery or worse for a few baubles? I suggest you rethink this, before we speak with Ramazith again, for I will not watch idly.~
@43   = ~I came here expecting to find one of those vile mages who would dissect this beautiful creature looking for spell components. Instead, we find a foolish man with his mind clouded by passion and desire. And while he deserves to be admonished for keeping this nymph here against her will, I suppose it can be understood... we would do well to resolve this without bloodshed, <CHARNAME>.~
@44   = ~I know not the man, but seeking to capitalize on the misfortune of another surely is despicable. However, the means which this woman is ready to put to use suggest that she is equally wicked. Truth be told, they both disgust me, and I propose we leave them to settle their problems without our interference.~
@45   = ~To become a pawn of a twisted necromancer with clear intent on upsetting the delicate cycle of nature? Not me, <CHARNAME>, I refuse to trudge through filthy sewers in search for rotten corpses. Every fiber of my being screams in protest at such a suggestion.~
@46   = ~It is quite reassuring to know that the path you have chosen is approved by Elminster himself. But more importantly, his approval comes with a useful word of advice.~
@47   = ~Fare thee well.~
@48   = ~<CHARNAME>! Do you truly wish to anger someone as powerful as Elminster? Do we not have enough enemies? Perhaps his response was slightly... unmerited, but that is no excuse for losing patience so quickly!~
@49   = ~Ah, <PRO_HESHE> knows not what <PRO_HESHE> is doing.~
@50   = ~Accompanied by a horde of equally humble baby wyverns? State your purpose here, lest I follow my duty as nature's servant and determine it for myself.~
@51   = ~That may be so, but they forgot to inform us that our adversary would be a young child. Rest assured, we will return to exchange a few words with them... and perhaps more than simple words.~
@52   = ~Well, that was an interesting insight. While I agree that these beasts are a part of the great cycle of Nature, it would be foolish to disregard the danger they present. And while they do aerate the soil and improve crop yields, they also reduce the number of farmers managing these lands. They love to reduce the ranks of unsuspecting travelers and adventurers as well... particularly of young and foolish ones.~
@53   = ~No, and imagine our surprise, when the witch we were supposed to kill turned out to be a mere child. This kind of deception makes me... very angry.~
@54   = ~<CHARNAME>, you have seen too many of these wicked beasts to believe their lies now. Raise your weapons, and let us rid the world of these foul mockeries of our friends and allies!~
@55   = ~I know that this must be very hard for you, to keep your temper in check when in the presence of these vile monsters. But you know that it would not be right to pollute these sacred floors with their foul blood. We will make our move against them... but not here and not now.~
@56   = ~We will surely end up in difficulties with the Watchers for this. And even though I approve of and share the intentions, a library, especially a sacred one as this, is no place for bloodshed.~
@57   = ~*snicker* I cannot remember ever laughing so hard... little <CHARNAME> and <PRO_HISHER> bearskin rug... I simply must see how our omnipotent authority figure looked, cute as a bug...~
@58   = ~P-perhaps in exchange I c-could allow <CHARNAME> to take a look at some of the paintings p-portraying you, my d-dear... especially the one I always c-carry with me.~
@59   = ~*blush* What... what painting, Khalid? I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about, and I suggest we drop this nonsense now. We have more important things to do.~
@60   = ~*snicker* <CHARNAME>, you owe me for t-this one...~
@61   = ~I do not relish taking this path, but, unfortunately, it is the only truly safe option. I stand in agreement with your decision, <CHARNAME>.~
@62   = ~Ya all gonna die!~
@63   = ~<CHARNAME>, we must not let this wretch get away, he will surely inform his superiors. It would be advisable if we could... prevent this, somehow...~
@64   = ~Do not dwell, <CHARNAME>. If Elminster won't, then I will tell you more of your foster father. But before we do that, there are things to be done... let us seek out this Tranzig, first. After that, there will be time to talk.~
@65   = ~I trust thee in this matter, Jaheira, as I trusted Gorion.~
@66   = ~True, <CHARNAME> has made some dubious decisions in the recent past, but perhaps we would do well not to judge <PRO_HIMHER> so quickly. I am quite confident that I will manage to keep <PRO_HIMHER> on the path of Balance, and by Gorion's memory, it shall be so.~
@67   = ~Hmm, it would seem that Elminster himself approves of your chosen path. If only he could make the claim that it was his guidance leading you down this path. Alas, he only reserves for himself the right to judge. *sigh*~
@68   = ~Now, Jaheira, as a druid thou should see that I cannot intervene too closely in matters of... local import. But I trust thee, as I trusted Gorion.~
@69   = ~Hmm... an odd choice of a reward, as well as an odd choice of words. Both set me ill at ease, to be truthful.~
@70   = ~Do you always trust so blindly, <CHARNAME>? Could you not see that these men were no thugs, and that we were tricked into killing them? Just to avoid any further mishaps, I should take over the leadership from now on. You have proven to be unfit for the role.~
@71   = ~Do not listen to the ramblings of a bitter woman, my good <PRO_LADYLORD>. You have done well.~
@72   = ~For a "thespian extraordinaire", your attempt of conning us into a murder scheme looks extremely dull-witted.~
@73   = ~Yes, I would have expected such opulence from these Lathanderites in rewarding us, there is splendour and excessiveness in everything they do, 'tis so out of balance... but all in all, at least they appreciate that a good deed has been done.~
@74   = ~Your help was indeed much appreciated.~
@75   = ~To accept the help of such a foul abomination of Nature? Have it your way, but be aware that this mindless undead will turn on us as soon as no other prey is in sight.~
@76   = ~You have obviously been standing in the sun for too long, soldier, as your head has clearly overheated. I suggest that you cease this foolishness, and let us pass. We are expected by the mayor of Nashkel, himself.~
@77   = ~The mayor of Nashkel himself, eh?~
@78   = ~*sigh* For all our sakes, I shall hold the party's funds from now on. You... you can have your *gem*, <CHARNAME>.~
@79   = ~You... you will see the true value of this gem yet!~
@80   = ~I am more appreciative of the subtle symphonies that see themselves played out in the serenity of a forest grove, but I must admit that I found this young bard's tale to my liking. I swear, compared to those fops that pollute the taverns of Baldur's Gate, this man actually restores the good name to his calling!~
@81   = ~I hope you remember that tale, Garrick. At our next stop, you will sit and write it down, as I would like to hear it again.~
@82   = ~Y-yes, ma'am! I sure do remember! Let me see if I can spin my talent and make some improvements to it...~
@83   = ~By Silvanus, DON'T!~
@84   = ~M'lady has fine taste.~
@85   = ~Athkatla? No, thank you very much. I have visited that foul pit and have no intention to return there, not of my own volition.~
@86   = ~It wasn't t-that bad, d-dear... at least your c-company made the trip worthwhile.~
@87   = ~Of course you know I would be happy any place with you, Khalid.~
@88   = ~Oh, it might not be the healthiest place for the likes of you.~
@89   = ~You must excuse <CHARNAME>'s rudeness, Master Berrun, as it stems from lack of experience as a leader. I think that until <PRO_HESHE> obtains the necessary competency, <CHARNAME> would do better to leave me to handle all our negotiations.~
@90   = ~Onwards we march then, <CHARNAME>. As this is your first mission, I fear that my skills as a healer will be heavily tested. Nevertheless, I will try to return all of us to Berrun still in one piece and victorious.~
@91   = ~There is no need for gratitude, Berrun. Helping you was our duty, as you well know. Despite my nagging doubts, <CHARNAME> did well, much better than I expected.~
@92   = ~Why, <PRO_HESHE> certainly did! Young <CHARNAME> here is a true hero of Nashkel!~
@93   = ~There is no need for gratitude, Berrun. Helping you was our duty, as you well know. Despite my nagging doubts, <CHARNAME> did well, much better than I expected.~
@94   = ~*sigh* Stop looking at me like that, <CHARNAME>! Surely, you do not question the loyalty and common sense of *this* druid?~
@95   = ~You are but a mockery of a druid, woman.~
@96   = ~Hmph. An offering from one of those filthy Shadow Druids. I am amazed he did not attack us on sight. Still, <CHARNAME>... I would not trust those detestable brews of theirs, that potion should be disposed of instead of consumed.~
@97   = ~Your companion professed <PRO_HISHER> friendship. Do not test my tolerance.~
@98   = ~But do you have the strength to carry out this penalty, you wicked fanatic? Does a handful of Shadow Druids have the strength to oppose civilization and shatter it, sending the remains of humankind back in descent to the barbaric state akin to orcs? No, neither you nor your vile comrades have the strength to do so, and ‘tis a lesson you are about to learn.~
@99   = ~Then I shall die, defending my faith, and return when the Great Mother needs me again.~
@100  = ~Or is it because of your extremist doctrine, more atrocities against nature are performed, as an act of revenge and retaliation to your cruel misdeeds? You and your blasted kin harm the Great Mother more than the civilization that you seek to oppose; you have done this by antagonizing Nature with one of its most wondrous creations, the humankind. You shall be dealt with swiftly, as will be the animal enslaver. Unlike you, we have the strength and will to oppose him.~
@101  = ~You will find no slaves here, Jaheira. Only willing warriors, both humans and beasts. But I can see that it is true - you are among those who lie willingly about us. You want to kill me and prove yourself the stronger? Do it, then, but know that by your hand a true defender of nature shall be slain.~
@102  = ~Ah, the infamous Shadow Archdruid himself, as unbalanced and unreasonable as any of his followers, as one can judge by the way of this greeting. And if the sickle that will try to cut me down is as dull as your wit, then I have very little to fear. <CHARNAME> and I shall clear this wood of the taint of Shadow Druids, so that the *true* druids can resume their caring nurturing of the forest.~
@103  = ~You are as good at platitudes as your mentor Seniyad.~
@104  = ~Ah, do not hesitate, little one. <CHARNAME> is surely interested in heroic ventures of the variety you are no doubt about to propose to us. *sigh* If only <PRO_HESHE> would not expect us to be equally as interested...~
@105  = ~Thank you, madam, for listening.~
@106  = ~Ah, yes. We trudged all this way to Baldur's Gate in order to steal a... a Tele-whatzit for this foolish little man. Or am I wrong, <CHARNAME>?~
@107  = ~'Telescope', madam... is such a clumsy word... if you know what I mean... I apologize, if I offended...~
@108  = ~Yes, suddenly becoming a common thief is indeed "too much fun". Having the Flaming Fist list us as wanted criminals for this burglary, while we are attempting to investigate the situation in the city, will be even more fun, will it not? How did I ever end up with one such as you, <CHARNAME>?~
@109  = ~You must lead an exciting life, madam.~
@110  = ~I must say that the generous reward somewhat "balances" out the moral dubiousness of the act itself... *snicker*~
@111  = ~With all due respect, ma'am... thanks for your help!~
@112  = ~You... you dare treat such a wonderful gift with such... such callousness... such indifference? Some would give anything to be in your place, but you... you do not even seem to care! Just... just stay away from me, elf, lest I do something we both regret later! No, make that, "lest I do something you will regret later".~
@113  = ~N-now you've r-really d-done it, Coran. *sigh* B-best to leave her alone, until I th-think of a good way to c-calm her d-down...~
@114  = ~We will help you, of course. But if I find out that you have been teasing or throwing rocks at the animal... then prepare to face the ire of this protector of Nature. It will be nothing compared to a single bear, that I promise.~
@115  = ~Where does this cold-hearted mercenary attitude come from, <CHARNAME>? I could understand you asking for gold and riches while doing the bidding of a noble, but the dryad is a pure and innocent sylvan creature that possesses no valuables.~
@116  = ~If pay I must, I will!~
@117  = ~To say that I am disappointed is to say nothing at all. If not for my oath to Gorion, I would have given you a good beating for this ruthlessness.~
@118  = ~I must find help!~
@119  = ~You knew full well that I would not stand for this, <CHARNAME>! I cannot let you murder this innocent creature! I do not relish breaking my oath to Gorion and raising a weapon against you, but you leave me no choice!~
@120  = ~It seems that I will have to face you in c-combat, <CHARNAME>, little as I r-relish it, but I c-cannot let you c-c-commit this evil act. I will always stand by Jaheira's side in this.~
@121  = ~I have mixed feelings about this, <CHARNAME>. On one hand, I detest everything that concerns the vile practice of necromancy... but on the other hand, only a monster could remain unmoved, when facing a plea of a crying child.~
@122  = ~I must bring Pixie to Daddy!~
@123  = ~The nereids are dangerous and cunning creatures. I wonder how many sailors this one lured to their deaths... but there is no malice in their intent, it is a part of their nature. Enslaving her by holding the shawl, containing her essence, was a despicable act I am glad we reversed.~
@124  = ~More than you can imagine, druid... but they died happy...~
@125  = ~A dragon? Here? Oh, stop being ridiculous. A dragon's presence is always easy to notice, so, I can assure you, there are no dragons hiding in the bowels of this mine. I would prescribe a brief walk in fresh air to clear these delusions.~
@126  = ~Well, missus, you know better, being an adventurer and all...~
@127  = ~I swear, the folly of these frightened miners exasperates me to no end. Who could be so dim-witted as to not recognize a common kobold?~
@128  = ~Then it's a kobold that'll kill me? Whatever...~
@129  = ~See? A KOBOLD! And they keep me quiet...~
@130  = ~This girl and I will never get along. She will not be an asset to this group, and will only bring strife and dissent amidst us.~
@131  = ~You mean that you have the scroll with which to release this petrified woman from her stone prison?~
@132  = ~Why yes I do! As I said, for mere 500 gold...~
@133  = ~*THWACK!*~
@134  = ~OW! You... you hit me! ~
@135  = ~Glad you noticed. I shall take that scroll, thank you very much. Now get out of here, and quickly, before I have the urge to hit you again. I have little patience for miscreants seeking profit in the misfortune of others.~
@136  = ~Well... Oookay. I wanted to see myself if that scroll would work...~
@137  = ~It figures that such a twisted, vile wretch would be spawned from nowhere else but Zhentil Keep... a mad servant to an equally mad god! But worry not, you will not sow strife any longer, dirty Zhent!~
@138  = ~You will see Cyric's glory when you rejoin the family, my lost sister...~
@139  = ~No, <PRO_HESHE> is not interested and never will be. Not while I am around, of that you can be sure. Your life is yours to ruin, but do not tempt <CHARNAME> to do the same.~
@140  = ~What do you... know...~
@141  = ~Well, it appears that we have finally reached the final hurdle on our path. We have achieved much, already... and you have led us with a competence unexpected at your young age, <CHARNAME>. We all trust in you and know that you will not falter now.~
@142  = ~*blush* Really, Entillis... did you have to mention that?~
@143  = ~Oh! Bwahahah! Please, could we have more embarrassing stories of Jaheira's past?~
@144  = ~Well, as much as I love these family reunions, we really have no time for this.~
@145  = ~Eh, sad as it is, we also have important business elsewhere... I am sorry, Entillis, but we really must move on. We will meet soon again, I hope.~
@146  = ~Yes, as much as I love these family reunions, we really have no time for this.~
@147  = ~I... I feel the curse is dissipating slowly! We are cured of the infection, <CHARNAME>! Praise Silvanus, we have done it!~
@148  = ~Hmph... strange. I still sense the foul infection within me. Perhaps... perhaps the death of this Selaad is the cure. I hope we will find him before it is too late.~
@149  = ~<CHARNAME>, do you realize what we have achieved? We have banished a most fearsome and deadly tanar'ri demon back to the planes that spawned it! I feel pride and relief both, for we could have easily been killed in the most gruesome manner by being turned into mindless ghouls... as nature's servant, I find that thought utterly horrifying. But now, Silvanus smiles on us all for what we have done!~
@150  = ~I care little for the little braggart's missing sword, but it will still serve balance to exact justice on those evil creatures.~
@151  = ~*groan* And to think that you grew up in a library, surrounded by books of great wisdom and lore... yet cannot recognize even the description of a common gnoll? I only now start to comprehend the job that lies before me...~
@152  = ~As I expected. At least now we have a good reason to end its unnatural state of existence!~
@153  = ~I am pleased to once again feel the soothing breath of Mother Nature, as her touch was barely noticeable in the depths of that accursed dungeon. Ah, but why do I complain? We did much good down there, did we not? Looking back at those battles, I marvel at how any of us are able to live and tell the tale, for the opponents we faced there were fierce beyond measure. And we can take much pride in destroying such a foul and unnatural creature as a demon knight, <CHARNAME>.~
@154  = ~It was a difficult task, but the cause was just, and we succeeded. Your contribution was especially important, Jaheira.~
@155  = ~As well as it should be, Jaheira! None shall stand in the way of our might, and with the aid of the loot we have captured here, our enemies will fall easily!~
@156  = ~Silence, woman! What is this "we" you keep mentioning the whole time? Look at me in awe, and bow down before <CHARNAME>, the conqueror of the demon knight!~
@157  = ~There is wisdom in your words, Jaheira, as always... and the pride and satisfaction of our victory will be excellently conveyed by the poem I am currently composing!~
@158  = ~A good deed to restore balance to this place, yes, but it was still so distressing being down in that pit. It is so odd that even while closer to Earthmother's heart, her heartbeats were much harder to discern.~
@159  = ~It is good to know that you find my aid beneficial, <CHARNAME>. There is not much else I can dedicate myself to, other than being useful to the group.~
@160  = ~'Tis true, we have all grown quite powerful, <CHARNAME>. It gives us a reason to feel good about our chances, though there is hardly any reason to be overconfident. Still, we have done many good deeds together, and I trust we will continue on this path.~
@161  = ~Hmph. Yes, I have noticed how we all have grown more and more powerful, but the change in you has been the most obvious. It is still not clear how you will use that power, but for the sake of us all, I pray that you do not stray from the path of balance. I hope that you will prove that my caution is unwarranted.~
@162  = ~It is good that you have chosen this moment to remind us all that despite all the powerful foes we conquered, you have not mastered your own immaturity just yet. Thank you for this reminder, <CHARNAME>.~
@163  = ~Yes, I thought you would. But be careful not to exaggerate our accomplishments... it would be preferable that the tales of our deeds do not spread too widely. I... I would prefer not to be mentioned at all, though I fear it would be too much to ask from you...~
@164  = ~That is an interesting observation, child. But I felt much the same as you do, while down there, so it is good to know that your link to Mother Nature is as strong and true as mine. I prayed to the Oak Father to give strength to all of us, but especially to you, for I saw you suffering. I am glad that my prayers were not for naught.~
@165  = ~No doubt you have heard that the sirines inhabit parts of the coast south of Candlekeep, living in a fortress by the seashore. Though I do not think you have ever come into a conflict with them, if we are to trudge through their territories, it is a likely outcome. Know that their main weapon is the powerful charm spells that twist our minds and make us fight each other. A strategy to prevent this is most welcome, and I have heard of clerics and mages using summons, such as skeletons and ogres, to keep the sirines at bay. Perhaps this option is worth considering.~
@166  = ~Of course, it may be that you do not plan to defend yourself from those charms, having heard that the beautiful sirines sometimes take male lovers. If that is so, then I will take this opportunity to remind you that the quest to bring Gorion's murderer to justice still requires your attendance...~
@167  = ~Leave for now, "Koveras"... but we will meet again, I promise as much. And thank these sacred walls of Candlekeep and the presence of the Watchers, else your blood would stain the tiles of the floor, as I speak!~
@168  = ~I urge you to refuse her offer, <CHARNAME>.~
@169  = ~I was not planning on letting her join us, Jaheira. Your druidic abilities are more than enough for our group.~
@170  = ~Jaheira, I trust that your wisdom will convince her to abandon those extremist views. Surely you would be capable of achieving this? Or are you absolutely sure that I should turn her offer down?~
@171  = ~Bah, we need another healer, and she looks capable. Besides, I am rather fond of the Shadow Druid philosophy...~
@172  = ~I am glad you think so and have not failed to see the reason.~
@173  = ~*sigh* Do not bother disguising your meaning, <CHARNAME>, I see past it with ease. Very well, let her join. I shall do my best to get along and mayhap convince her of the folly of her ways, but I will remain cautious. My reward for trying could very well be a sharp bite from this rabid wolf.~
@174  = ~You are... WHAT? If this is merely a jest to annoy me, then I assure you that it is a very poor one. However, if your words are true, there will be more than one person in our group I will be wary of.~
@175  = ~<CHARNAME>, this area is rumored to be crowded with basilisks. Their gaze will petrify any of us, unless we protect ourselves with spells or potions. Unless you have such means of protection, I recommend that we return to Beregost. That is, if becoming a lawn ornament is not part of your planning.~
@176  = ~<CHARNAME>, I know that this part of Cloakwood is heavily infested with ettercaps and spiders. I would advise great caution, as these creatures are not only highly poisonous, but also are known to set devious traps for the unwary. While I possess the knowledge of how to cure the dangerous toxins, having a steady supply of antidote potions is advisable... especially if you insist on more thorough examination of this area.~
@177  = ~Wait, <CHARNAME>! I see that someone with whom I share the calling of being a druid approaches us. No doubt he will be forthcoming with information about the perils that this part of Larswood Forest holds.~
@178  = ~Well, <CHARNAME>... excessive use of the henbane is a common oversight by some inexperienced druids, so I hope this will serve as a lesson for all of us. It appears that we are about to receive some answers.~
@179  = ~We approach the grounds where the Shadow Druids tread. Allow me to tell you more of them, <CHARNAME>. The druidic order normally accepts many different philosophies, and thus, has many different branches... but only one of these branches live waging constant warfare with the others, mostly secret, but on occasion openly. These people, the Shadow Druids, believe that Nature is a cleansing force that must be put to use to fight civilization, that, according to their beliefs, has weakened humankind.~
@180  = ~Their attempts to encourage people to abandon the attainment of civilization and return to more primitive existence as hunters and gatherers are often carried out with aggression and violence. While they think themselves as caring for Nature and Balance, the means by which they fight for their goals can be cruel and evil, contrary to what the druidic order proposes. They will not let us pass through their territories without interrogation... and as soon as they see me, they might react violently. I count on your support, <CHARNAME>.~
@181  = ~Hmmm... as I mentioned, I am in quite a hurry, but since you seem so sincerely interested...~
@182  = ~N-now, d-dear... it wouldn't d-do us any g-good to lose our tempers now, would it? All d-debts will be repaid in t-time, we will both m-make sure of it, t-together... with <CHARNAME>'s help, of course.~
@183  = ~G-Gorion would be proud of you, <CHARNAME>, for going this far... what c-comes next will put us all in mortal d-danger, and not all of us might return, but... w-we will follow you, hoping for the best.~
@184  = ~Uhhhhmmmm...~
@185  = ~So, we meet again. Sorry, but I don't... hey, who are you carrying there?~
@186  = ~It's one of our companions, he was wounded.~
@187  = ~A hobgoblin we killed. We think he's a member of the Chill, so we're taking him back to Beregost for identification.~
@188  = ~He's a merchant we found. His caravan was attacked by bandits, and he was badly wounded. He paid us to take him back to Beregost.~
@189  = ~This is Samuel. We want to turn him in for 50 gold.~
@190  = ~*sigh* <CHARNAME>, I know it seems difficult to imagine, but not all members of the Flaming Fist are complete meatheads. Though I would not be too surprised if this one buys your ridiculous excuse.~
@191  = ~Do you feel up to wrestling some ankhegs, <CHARNAME>? I agree that their shells could be used to procure a nice set of armor. But the danger is great, as their mandibles are strong enough to snap a small tree. They may catch you unaware by popping out of the ground in front of you, only to squirt a stream of toxic acid in your face. We have arrived during their mating season, so they will be extremely aggressive.~
@192  = ~Oooh, they are more aggressive in the period of mating, Jaheira? Uh, is that also true for other... umm, animals?~
@193  = ~N-n-now, Imoen, I d-don't r-r-really like that t-tone of your voice...~
@194  = ~Oops! Guess I've been found out.~
@195  = ~The lizard that just flew over our heads was indeed a wyvern, <CHARNAME>.~
@196  = ~A most fearsome opponent, its talons can rip apart any overconfident warrior... and watch out for its barbed tail. If the stinger catches you, the poison may kill you, before I have a chance to heal you.~
@197  = ~My druidic powers, while considerable, are not limitless.~
@198  = ~You did explain the dangers of wyvern hunting to <CHARNAME> before asking for help, did you not, Coran?~
@199  = ~But of course... And, if I may add... I find that your natural beauty is even further enhanced by our presence in the forest domain. It makes you appear... like a graceful dryad...~
@200  = ~But of course... Speaking of <CHARNAME>... do you find that her beauty is even further enhanced by our presence in the forest domain? As graceful as a dryad... is she not?~
@201  = ~Bah! Why do I even bother addressing you, elf?~
@202  = ~It is nice of you to say so, <CHARNAME>, but do not make my role more important than that of others. Especially Khalid's, for he showed exceptional skill and courage.~
@203  = ~N-nonsense, d-dear... I was just trying to do my best, as were we all...~
@204  = ~That is my husband, <CHARNAME>. Modesty is his second name. Your foster father could have picked no better guardian for you, trust me in this.~
@1001 = ~To you, as well.~
@1002 = ~So it does, and so we shall.~
@1003 = ~Me want to help!~
@206  = ~Well, they'll sleep better now. Thank you.~
@207  = ~The law is served.~
@210  = ~Pay no heed to the idle ramblings of an old man. Farewell, <CHARNAME>, and thank you for the book.~
// Modified version of @64, in case Tranzig is already dead
@211  = ~Do not dwell, <CHARNAME>. If Elminster won't, then I will tell you more of your foster father. But before we do that, there are things to be done...~
