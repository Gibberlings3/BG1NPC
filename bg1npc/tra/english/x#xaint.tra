@0    = ~At long last I see again my enchanted sword. Do not delude yourself into thinking that it makes me invulnerable, <CHARNAME>. In this place and age, a Moonblade creates more problems for its wielder than it solves. *sigh*~
@1    = ~Are we waiting for more of Mulahey's cronies to come along? Let us be away from these gruesome caves... ~
@2    = ~So, we are to bid our last farewell to the sky, before we are to die inside of this... thing. Well, at least our grave will look *remarkable*.~
@3    = ~Seldarine, yet another kind of doom, which befalls the unsuspecting...~
@4    = ~While I have little trust for this individual, I would still heed his words, <CHARNAME>. The leaders of the Iron Throne are positioned too conveniently for my liking. It may well be a trap, for all we know.~
@5    = ~*sigh* I have expected this...~
@6    = ~Perhaps you and your sibling are indeed equally doomed, <CHARNAME>, but this woman is doomed regardless. I fear that Sarevok's revenge for her betrayal will not be long in coming.~
@7    = ~Didn't I tell you? We ARE doomed.~
@8    = ~You did, Xan, but <CHARNAME> just had to have summoned a powerful agent of ancient evil to confirm your words. Too bad that it appears to have other uses as well. Such as doombringing, in addition to the mere doomsaying. Oh, well. With luck, we'd get out of it somehow.~
@9    = ~We are surely doomed, Coran. Accept it.~
@10   = ~All orders are doomed to fail sooner or later, but something tells me that your own doom will come even faster than ours, if <CHARNAME> makes such a decision.~
@11   = ~Life is indeed hollow and has no meaning, but should we embrace nothingness instead? I think not.~
@12   = ~Peculiar, that I can almost empathize with my captor, now that I am not in chains. Almost, but not quite, for if we do not overwhelm him quickly, he will doubtless summon hordes of kobolds. They infest this warren, like maggots infest moldy bread. We do not stand a chance against such odds. ~
@13   = ~Tazok? If we shall get out of here alive, you would do well to remember this name, <CHARNAME>. Our chance for success is miniscule, but we must seek him out, if we are to continue this misfortunate investigation.~
@14   = ~O, Seldarine...~
@15   = ~It is a trap... mark my words, the fiend is luring us into some devious trap...~
@16   = ~*sigh* Saying "Have I not warned you?" is such a meager consolation, when one faces death.~
@17   = ~It is a wonder that this creature is interested in talking... I grow curious of what it might say; besides, it does delay our imminent death... somewhat.~
@18   = ~From the look of the surrounding area, a deadly spider's attack is no surprise... Why did we venture into this ghastly cave?~
@19   = ~*sighs* At least we are likely to get a gravestone monument out of this one, in addition to the grave itself...~
@20   = ~Exhilarating! Finally, instead of 'you're all going to die' a villain gives us a choice: to kill or be killed. Wait! Have not we had it all along?~
@21   = ~Why does everything we do turn out to be the same chase with death?~
@22   = ~Resurrection and undeath are the two trapped doors, which those who sought immortality had stumbled upon and hailed them as hiding an escape route from death. One should never open those doors.~
@23   = ~I would have laughed at his description of us, if foreboding had not gripped my heart... I foresee that his next step would be to summon these flesh-loving pets of his.~
@24   = ~There is a satisfaction of sorts in saying 'I told you so!' Unfortunately, I do not have long to enjoy it: from what I have heard, monsters even on the surface have revolting table manners; how could one expect the ones of the sewers to engage into a pleasant prolonged conversation, before sitting to dinner?~
@25   = ~In the years past I often tried to find out what is mine foremost worry. You made it easier for me - I worry now most of all that when you fall dead, you should break the vial with the antidote, and thus our efforts would end up in vain.~
@26   = ~The mention of it gave him back his reason; immediately he demanded it to be dealt out to him in a lawful fashion, for the reason that he had caused it... This man is almost as entangled with death as we are, <CHARNAME>.~
@27   = ~Had you heard the tale about a rescued djinni, <CHARNAME>? After a thousand years in his bottle the djinni vowed to serve whoever would release him for three and thirty years; but none came. After ten thousand years he vowed to fulfill three wishes of his rescuer. And after fifty thousand years he vowed to kill whoever would uncork the bottle.~
@28   = ~I am leaving it to you to guess what his perplexed would-be savior got as a reward... and why I was reminded of this very story just now.~
@29   = ~This poor woman's tears make me think that nobody would mourn my passing. A wanderer, misunderstood by all and alien to all, I shall be cut down by a cruel blade while the passionless world looks the other way.~
@30   = ~*She wipes her tears with an edge of her apron.* You poor soul.~
@31   = ~<CHARNAME>, this sounds exactly like one of those stories where unwise and incapable adventurers summon great evil out of bravado. Usually a company of well-known heroes just happens nearby to subdue the unleashed demons and rescue the pathetic miscreants. Since I have no luck to speak of, I do not experience a burning desire to trust it and let such a tale to unfold before my very eyes. Besides, in this godsforsaken town *we* represent the 'well-known' heroes. Even the most optimistic moron can appreciate that we are not up to fighting ancient evils of even local importance. Let us be away.~
@32   = ~*sigh* I wish that all those fools, who dream of glory the adventures bring, stood right here. This is the reward for the blood, gore and wounds - and it is a measly one.~
@33   = ~Allow me to introduce myself, Mayor. I would have done so earlier, but alas, I was rudely diverted from visiting your town by the kobolds. I am Xan of the Evereskan Greycloaks, sent by my people to investigate the iron shortage. ~
@34   = ~We welcome Evereska's help, Xan. Thank you for lending <CHARNAME> a hand with the re-opening of the mines.~
@35   = ~Allow me to introduce myself, Mayor. I would have done so earlier, but alas, I was rudely diverted from visiting your town by the kobolds. I am Xan of the Evereskan Greycloaks, sent by my people to investigate the iron shortage. ~
@36   = ~This... this does not fill me with confidence, au contraire... O, Corellon, but the stench of it... and the appearance...~
@37   = ~I think I am going to be sick.~
@38   = ~I like the sound of it not at all! <CHARNAME>, if I were a leader of this tragically weak company, I would have quoted a previous engagement to get us out of witnessing and, Corellon forbid, participating in any kind of experiments set by mad mages.~
@39   = ~Cyricist? From all mad religious fanatics those are the worst kind... Fancy meeting them here... in the middle of nowhere. Just my ill luck, I suppose.~
@40   = ~*sigh* What kind of land is this where your name alone can cause you to be slaughtered by brutes?~
@41   = ~At least these particular ones do not look all that bright.~
@42   = ~My under-qualified leader, why won't you give this mob the sweet-sounding name of Gevalenties Mordabintius Celebrantus?~
@43   = ~If I am not mistaken, we are about to be burdened with the accursed bloodied dagger this maniac has in his hands. Take it, <CHARNAME>, if you wish to seal our doom. Otherwise let us... just slowly back away from this man.~
@44   = ~My death? You are late, then. I have been expecting our meeting every moment of every day since I have left my beautiful Evereska for these barbaric lands. But I suppose my expectations in this matter never counted...~
@45   = ~<CHARNAME> in the buff, on a bearskin rug... Even with the look she is giving me now, which forebodes my imminent death, it is still a tantalizing thought.~
@46   = ~Ah, the carefree youth, how I envy you...~
@47   = ~That's what they call a good-looking corpse, I presume. <CHARNAME>, do pay attention - that's what comes out of living fast and dying young.~
@48   = ~Ma'am, if you knew <CHARNAME> but a little longer, you would not even bother to ask... This robust champion has made it <PRO_HISHER> trade to challenge death. Do not doubt that <PRO_HESHE> would grab for this unique opportunity to finally be done with our lives... Ah, I am getting a sick feeling that I am going into the last fateful battle to sacrifice myself for the sake of killing a madman.~
@49   = ~Art we well, O Chosen one? As usual, our lives hang by a thread pulled out of a cloak that Shaundakul tossed away, because it would not hold together any longer. We have not felt hope in so many days that yestereve I had to inquire of <CHARNAME> if <PRO_HESHE> could remind me of its proper spelling.~
@50   = ~*sighs* Pleasure or surprise? Whatever might be the case. Everyone who meets <CHARNAME> nowadays needs to look at <PRO_HIMHER> for a while... for it is most likely the very last time <PRO_HESHE> will be seen alive...~
@51   = ~Peculiar. You are going to end your life, because you think it is pointless, and I think life is pointless, because it is going to end...~
@52   = ~*sigh* Another case of misguided optimism. Look closely at this man, <CHARNAME>. Note that he thinks he is playing it safe, since he only has one enemy who is powerful enough to swallow him whole without chewing. Note this very well.~
@53   = ~Ah, but I have skill and natural talent to stick between their teeth... or in their throat, if I have to.~
@54   = ~So gifted you are that you were nigh executed?~
@55   = ~Yet another one of my kin, who is wasting his days in adventures on these wild roads, as if he is a near-sighted human. Is death so sweet, Kivan?~
@56   = ~Death is horrible, Quessir.~
@57   = ~Then why are you inviting it by trying to measure yourself up against the scum that pollutes these forests?~
@58   = ~Because I must.~
@59   = ~An ancient red will not burn us to a crisp, but we'd die of poison, instead. <CHARNAME>, have mercy on us, walk wide around this suicidal maniac... though then we risk fording this mighty stream. Under current weather conditions, it can only lead to influenza. Why, oh why did you choose this bridge?~
@60   = ~The scenery, mellonamin, the scenery...~
@61   = ~So, are you as jittery as this cold-footed, long-faced fellow?~
@62   = ~Do we hunt together?~
@63   = ~How charming. Either be sliced into leather bands by this... harpy, or suffer her company forever. Truly, the madness fills the Sword Coast to the brim and spills over from its peoples. And I am almost sure that some of the suicide mongers who accompany me are ready to jump at the offer...~
@64   = ~Is it too much to hope for that curses are not virulent? Or is this an omen of how we are bound to end up? I do not cherish the thought of forever wandering the defiled places of my kin's past glory seeking out the rest of you...~
@65   = ~Escaping imprisonment and certain death by a narrow margin is becoming repetitive. Perhaps I will stay here, though I loathe to be locked away from the sun and the stars. This is not *too* bad, as far as prisons go. I have a foreboding feeling that the next one will be much worse, and permanent indeed, since nobody in his right mind can hope for *three* miraculous deliveries in a row.~
@66   = ~You whine like a child, like an insipid annoying spoiled brat.~
@67   = ~*sighs* And you have told me that it was my tender elven stomach. Oh, do not apologize for your mockery. Our deaths will wash away all the petty differences soon enough.~
@68   = ~I can help you, you dolt.~
@69   = ~Less civilized than the inhabitants of this Keep? 'Tis a madmen's place, for how can one be called sane when he engages in a folly of preserving what is doomed to perish?~
@70   = ~A complete stranger dreaming of you can only forebode ill. Whether you chose to listen to the girl or not, you are doomed, <CHARNAME>, and so are we all with you.~
@71   = ~*Sigh* A wise man once said: pity the land in need of heroes. I pity the heroes...~
@1001 = ~Do what you will. I care not.~
@1002 = ~Be that as it may. My fate is sealed.~
@1003 = ~Doom to theeeeee!~
@1004 = ~In time, nothingness will embrace you.~
@1005 = ~Cling to whatever consolation you have, for you will die!~
@1006 = ~Because it is the way of things.~
@1007 = ~It matters not at all in the end.~
@1008 = ~I guess that's a chance you'll just have to take.~
@1009 = ~Behold!~
@1010 = ~Yet preserve it we do. Go in peace.~
@1011 = ~Bye!~
@1012 = ~Prepare to meet your end!~
