@0    = ~Oooo... so many books! You must be very clever, <CHARNAME>, growing up here...~
@1    = ~Not really. Haven't read one of them.~
@2    = ~I wouldn't say "clever", but yes, I did a fair bit of reading, growing up.~
@3    = ~You better believe it! Read every single one of them!~
@4    = ~Boo's so happy to be here. He says he can hardly wait to send word to his family that he has found such a feast! Yes, old and greasy pages, row after row after row, ready to be devoured by diligent hamsters...~
@5    = ~*Squeak*~ [GAM_48]
@6    = ~What? Oh, Boo says such an intle... inle... inletectual feast. Was that correct, Boo?~
@7    = ~Yes! This is the den of evil where they hold sweet Dynaheir! Onward, friends, onward!~
@8    = ~Oooohhh... look, Boo, such a large city! So many people, and so many houses. I'm sure around here somewhere we'll find a shop that sells those little wheels you wanted so bad.~
@9    = ~Boo?! Boo, where are you?!~
@10   = ~... and then the little Steam Dragon said: "I knew I could do it, I knew I could".~
@11   = ~What art thou about, Minsc?~
@12   = ~Nothing. Just telling Boo a goodnight story.~
@13   = ~Minsc, thou worry me increasingly.~
@14   = ~Why? Is there something wrong with Minsc?~
@15   = ~Thou speakest to thy hamster almost incessantly. 'Tis not quite... mmm... normal.~
@16   = ~Well, neither is spewing fire from your fingertips, and Dynaheir does it every day. Minsc can't do it.~
@17   = ~I am a learned invoker, and mine purpose is to exercise the arts magical.~
@18   = ~And Minsc is a ranger, and he's trained to speak with creatures of the wild. If you can't hear Boo, this doesn't mean he's not talking, right?~
@19   = ~Indeed, but it appears that thou givest him much authority in thine life.~
@20   = ~Yes, because Boo is my friend! I listen to your advice too.~
@21   = ~Indeed, thou dost. *sighs* Mayhaps this matter should be laid to rest until such time that we return to Rashemen.~
@22   = ~Many Othlor art great healers, and surely it is in their power to help. On mine own, I have no means to improve thine condition.~
@23   = ~Oh, I think Boo wants another story. Do you know any good stories, Dynaheir? Minsc has really run out of them.~
@24   = ~Thou must surely be joking! I would never relate a tale to a hamster.~
@25   = ~Please? Pretty please? You could tell Boo about that time you went for a swim in the Lake of Dragons, and Orovar stole your clothes and then...~
@26   = ~Minsc! Thou would not dare to... ahem... I mean 'tis not a proper story for such a young hamster. I would tell him "The story of the Princess Swan and her Candy Castle".~
@27   = ~Peanut Castle. I think that would interest Boo more.~
@28   = ~Indeed. So, once upon a time the beautiful Princess Sunflower Seed went to a dance to the Sunflower Dale in the Peanut Forest-~
@29   = ~Minsc, what was that about Orovar? The Lake of Dragons... it's somewhere in the Dalelands, is not it?~
@30   = ~Sorry, Boo. Imoen wants to hear about Orovar. Heh, we took the same ship to Westgate with Orovar, and he really liked Dynaheir-~
@31   = ~Minsc! Imoen, I would appreciate if thou would not pester our friend with this.~
@32   = ~Teach me "Burning Hands"?~
@33   = ~'Tis not a joking affair. Thou couldst start a forest fire if thou art not careful.~
@34   = ~So Minsc, what did Orovar do?~
@35   = ~On the other hand, thou art quite cautious for a rogue. 'Tis not Hathran's custom to turn away one who is willing to learn. Mayhaps I can be persuaded to teach thee.~
@36   = ~Promise?~
@37   = ~*sighs* Promise.~
@38   = ~That Orovar, he had a cabin by the Lake of Dragons, and he invited us to stay for a week... And Dynaheir, she was so sea sick that she was unable to travel-~
@39   = ~Minsc, I think that Boo'd rather hear the story about the Princess Sunflower Seed and the Peanut Castle.~
@40   = ~Here is the sand, Edwin...~
@41   = ~Yes, yes, give it to me! After a fortnight of labors, I have finally finished the Account of the Death of Iron Lord Yegoriy Yasnoi, his Four Hundred Fifty best and Thirty Hathran... Now I only need to dry out the ink. (I would not want a single letter of this to go to waste!)~
@42   = ~I had to take some from Boo's emergency sandbox...~
@43   = ~Wha... ? Never mind, I doubt that Nevron lives long enough to see the last page.~
@44   = ~Yes, yes... he will not live that long... (Boredom as an assassination tactic - an idea only such an elaborate mind as mine could have devised. And knowing Nevron, he'd read every page of it thoroughly, since I put enough "the revelation of Rashemi strategy", "confidential", "top secret", "burn after reading"... in the cover letter. Nevron's death will make me a Zulkir.)~
@45   = ~Yes... your loyal friend, Edwin Odesseiron. There. It is signed!~
@46   = ~Here is the pigeon you asked for, Edwin. So, you say that sending it will stop Thay's attacks on Rashemen?~
@47   = ~I said that I'll send your story to my superior, and Edwin Odesseiron is a man of his word.~
@48   = ~Fly, pigeon, fly! Swiftly now, or I'll have a pigeon pie for dinner!~
@49   = ~Oh... poor birdy... the scroll is too heavy for her... she is falling... right into the swamp! Hold on, bird, Minsc and Boo are going to rescue you!~
@50   = ~No! My genius yet again thwarted by the insufferable wildlife! Rashemi! Tell me the story again - and in the meanwhile find an eagle, or better yet, I shall conjure one! (You have not seen the last of Death of Iron Lord Yegoriy Yasnoi, his Four Hundred Fifty Best and Thirty Hathran!)~
@51   = ~Eldoth! Eldoth! Minsc would like a word with you!~
@52   = ~Damn... How does he choose these times to chatter? I'm coming, I'm coming!~
@53   = ~Friend Eldoth, has Minsc mentioned that Boo has very good hearing? And that he's a very light sleeper?~
@54   = ~You called me away from my dear Skie for this?!~
@55   = ~So, when Boo tells Minsc that something fishy is going on, and that there are two people in a bedroll instead of one, Minsc has to make sure everybody keeps his place, right?~
@56   = ~I don't see how this can be your...~
@57   = ~Minsc would ask the sleazy Eldoth to get back into his own bedroll and stay right here, where Boo can keep an eye on him.~
@58   = ~But Khalid and Jaheira almost every night... in fact, right now they are somewhere "looking for berries"! In the middle of the night!~
@59   = ~It's not Eldoth's concern, what our good and married friends are up to! Minsc has always said that Khalid is a brave man, and this proves it even more!~
@60   = ~My dear Minsc, maybe we can come to an arrangement? I still think I have some Tethyrian wine left, and...~
@61   = ~The sleazy Eldoth will get back into his own bedroll, or Minsc will do to him what our berserkers do to marauding Thayvians who bother nice Rashemi girls!~
@62   = ~I'm not sure what "extended circumcision" means, but Minsc will gladly perform it on Eldoth! Several times!~
@63   = ~Eh... now that you mention it... I think I'll sleep in my own bedroll from now on... errr... good night, Minsc.~
@64   = ~Good night, sleazy Eldoth.~
@65   = ~Boo, remind me to ask <CHARNAME> tomorrow morn' what "extended circumcision" means... You don't think that's a good idea?... Yes, maybe you're right... Good-night, Boo.~
@66   = ~You keep an eye on that seducer, and if he tries anything with that poor innocent girl, tell Minsc, and he will take the boot to his ways.~
@67   = ~*Squeak!*~ [GAM_48]
@68   = ~Yes, Boo, for goodness... mmm... honor... *SNOOORE! SNOOORE!*~
@69   = ~Hold, good Minsc. We should f-first study the p-place, lest we fall into an ambush.~
@70   = ~Ambush? Is that some kind of a hole, that we can fall into?~
@71   = ~No. It's a k-kind of shrub with long, hard thorns.~
@72   = ~What?... oh, thank you, Boo. Minsc understands now. No fear, my friend, Boo shall sniff out any gnoll stupid enough to try and ambush us!!! Onward I say!~
@73   = ~Onward, but with c-caution. I don't like the look of this b-bridge. The planks look old and slippery.~
@74   = ~Khalid, if Minsc hadn't witnessed your valor on the battlefield, he would think you are afraid! On we go!~
@75   = ~But we all know this can't be, no man brave enough to marry Jaheira would be scared of some puny gnolls.~
@76   = ~P-please, Minsc, keep your voice down. Jaheira sometimes is very sensitive to...~
@77   = ~What are you two mulling over, looking exactly like two oldwives? Khalid, was Minsc talking about *that*?~
@78   = ~Nothing, d-dear! Nothing! We weren't talking at all.~
@79   = ~But I thought I heard...~
@80   = ~Maybe the wind. Yes, the wind in this g-gorge. So, what are we waiting for Minsc? Follow me! B-but quietly!~
@81   = ~You know, Boo, it makes my heart good to see such a display of courage. Just look at him go! Hm, now that he mentioned it, this bridge doesn't look quite safe. Let's cross carefully, shall we?~
@82   = ~Yes, Khalid was really brave to charge as he did... danger? Where? I see nothing... oh... *that* danger.~
@83   = ~Ranger, are you talking again to that rodent? How many times did I tell you to...~
@84   = ~Yes Khalid, I hear you! Minsc is coming, Minsc is coming! And he brings Boo along!~
@85   = ~One day, I shall have the Great Druid test *my* hearing. If there's nothing wrong, then these two will hear of *that*.~
@86   = ~Ajantis, Minsc and Boo would be most interested in learning more about this righteous Butt-kicking Lodge that you belong to.~
@87   = ~Oh? Glad to be of help, my friend. Yes, the Order of the Radiant Heart and its noble pursuits should be known even as far as Rashemen, and I'll gladly pass on to you what little enlightenment I possess so far-~
@88   = ~Errrr... Ajantis...~
@89   = ~...and so, with the combined powers of Helm, Tyr and Torm...~
@90   = ~Ajantis?~
@91   = ~Yes?~
@92   = ~All this sounds fine and grand, but tell Minsc, do you have good ale?~
@93   = ~Ale? There are some kegs in the cellar, but why...~
@94   = ~There are?! Then Minsc and Boo want to join!~
@95   = ~YOU?!!! And the hamster? Join the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart? Why?~
@96   = ~Well, Minsc always missed the good feasts that the Lodge gave after stomping out some nest of villainy.~
@97   = ~Ahhh... yes, those times, when the ale flowed and the Vremyonni and Wychlaran passed on their wisdom, while the strong-hipped and beautiful ladies welcomed the returning heroes and danced with their bodices half-unlaced and those bright skirts...~
@98   = ~DID WHAT?!!~
@99   = ~Welcomed the returning heroes. Oh, goodie, Minsc is so happy to have found a new lodge in this far away place. Look, even little Boo looks forward in anticipation to the great feast your Order will give in our honor at the end of our quest.~
@100  = ~Oh, I see... Mmmmm... well, sorry to disappoint you, Minsc, but the Order does not engage in such exotic practices as you painted so... mmm... vividly. A good deed is a reward in itself.~
@101  = ~No feasting?~
@102  = ~No.~
@103  = ~No strong women to soothe the wounds and reward the brave?~
@104  = ~DEFINITELY NOT!~
@105  = ~No wonder friend Ajantis looks so pale and uptight. No, sir knight, if that's the case, Minsc will wait to get back home, so he and Boo can enjoy the spoils of our heroics!~
@106  = ~Thank Helm for that.~
@107  = ~For what?~
@108  = ~Never mind.~
@109  = ~Hmph... this place? This is but a village, compared to Waterdeep or Athkatla.~
@110  = ~And can you find little hamster wheels in Waterdeep?~
@111  = ~I... suppose there are some shops that...~
@112  = ~And these little slides?~
@113  = ~Well...~
@114  = ~And...~
@115  = ~Yes! Yes, Minsc, whatever you want!~
@116  = ~Minsc and Boo and friend Ajantis must go there as soon as possible! You will help us find Boo a wheel! This will be our next quest!~
@117  = ~Minsc, shouldn't we finish first our current quest?~
@118  = ~What quest?~
@119  = ~You know... the Iron Throne?~
@120  = ~Yes! The Throne will feel the wrath of my hamster! Minsc and Boo and friend Ajantis shall kick evil butt before the day is done! Onward, and fear not, mighty Boo shall show us the way with his unerring sense of hamster direction!~
@121  = ~Led by a hamster. Well, *this* was never in the books!~
@122  = ~Step without fear, little lady. Rangers protect all good of heart in the forest.~
@123  = ~Say, Minsc, how come you never became a ranger yourself?~
@124  = ~Wha... ? Your words confuse Minsc and Boo, for Minsc is a ranger!~
@125  = ~Don't be silly, you're still so young! Shouldn't you, I dunno, still be training and stuff?~
@126  = ~Ah, but Minsc is constantly training... when he is not giving the boot to evil, that is.~
@127  = ~Oh, so Dynaheir's your mentor then, right?~
@128  = ~No, Dynaheir is my witch! Minsc and Boo are Dynaheir's protectors from evil! Minsc doesn't need a teacher now, for Boo gives him pointers, and then he studies himself!~
@129  = ~Look, little one, it's just like some wolves run in packs, and some on their own. Only Minsc does not run, he studies.~
@130  = ~But... but I could say I'm training myself in the way of magic, but that doesn't make it true, you know! You have to actually study... as boring as it sounds.~
@131  = ~It's not boring at all, for Minsc and Boo to learn the forest lore! Minsc and Boo know much already, little one!~
@132  = ~Right, Boo?~
@133  = ~So, after you are done learning, you will be a ranger?~
@134  = ~Ah, you are joking again! Minsc *is* a ranger, already! Ask Boo!~
@135  = ~Hehe, sure. And I'm Mystra, goddess of magic!~
@136  = ~Woah... You are a goddess? The Hidden One of the Three? Then evil must surely learn to show us more respect!~
@137  = ~Hello, little one!~
@138  = ~Woah... Minsc, I didn't know you could be so quiet! No offense, but you seem a bit too... well, *big* to be able to go sneaking around.~
@139  = ~Minsc learned how to remain hidden and quiet a long, long time ago-~
@140  = ~Wow! You trained with a thief?~
@141  = ~No, why? Minsc's teacher was a great ranger from Minsc and Boo's home country, Rashemen.~
@142  = ~Oh, really? Trained you in ranger stuff then, right?~
@143  = ~Right. Minsc always wanted to be a ranger... for rangers like forests and animals, just as Minsc and Boo do.~
@144  = ~Hey, I like that stuff, too! Doesn't mean I want to be a ranger, though...~
@145  = ~That's good. If everyone was a ranger, who'd rangers help, then, in the forests?~
@146  = ~*ACHOO*!~
@147  = ~Bless you, Minsc.~
@148  = ~Hah, do not fear, tempest priestess. Minsc needs no blessing to smite his foes, so long as he has the guidance of his wise and caring miniature giant space hamster.~
@149  = ~That wasn't what I meant, Minsc. But since you bring it up, why do you not embrace the strength that can be provided only by faith? Your so-called "witch" is hardly a fit comparison to myself in the heat of battle.~
@150  = ~Surely 'tis plain that the might of a blessed mace proves itself superior on the field of battle to a mere... what is it the mages call it... "magic missile?" *snorts amusedly*~
@151  = ~What's that, Boo? Oh yes, Minsc agrees! The tempest priestess is most foolhardy to be looking down upon that which made her such a pretty birdbath!~
@152  = ~BY TEMPUS' SHIELD, WILL YOU PEOPLE NEVER CEASE BRINGING THAT UP?!~
@153  = ~Uh... Minsc apologizes, and will go stand over there now. It would be a great tragedy, if you were to step on Boo in your loud, smelly rage.~
@154  = ~By the gods, you tempt me!~
@155  = ~Boo! Boo! Has anyone seen Boo?~
@156  = ~Here it is.~
@157  = ~That's not Boo! That's some other white and pink giant space hamster! My Boo is grey and brown...~
@158  = ~That's Boo, only I washed it. Namara keeps pulling it into her mouth, so...~
@159  = ~I like it, when little Namara plays with him. But why wash? Oh, no matter, I can see that his color returns already, as he rolls on the floor.~
@160  = ~*sighs* More washing up...~
@161  = ~Evil Red Wizard! Minsc and Boo will tell you why Thavians will never defeat Rashemi.~
@162  = ~Oh. Exactly the type of mental exercise I required! (My irony is unrivaled, I confess...) Discussing politics with a hamster! (Better then discussing politics with its owner, however.) Speak on. Amuse me.~
@163  = ~Here is the story steeped in lore about the death of valiant Fyrra Vsevolod and his seven retainers.~
@164  = ~Fascinating...~
@165  = ~Evil Tarchion captured once Fyrra Vsevolod and his seven retainers...~
@166  = ~The suspense is killing me...~
@167  = ~Fyrra was taken to the evil Tarchion and was asked if he'd yield to Thay and kneel to Tarchion. And Fyrra Vsevolod answered that until the last drop of blood he will be loyal to Rashemen and will fight Thay. Then the evil Tarchion ordered the Fyrra to be bled to death, and his body was thrown to jackals.~
@168  = ~Then the first of the Fyrra Vsevolod's retainers was taken to the evil Tarchion and was asked if he'd yield to Thay and kneel to Tarchion. And Fyrra Vsevolod's first retainer answered that until the last drop of blood he will be loyal to Rashemen and will fight Thay. Then the evil Tarchion ordered the Fyrra's first retainer to be bled to death, and his body was thrown to jackals.~
@169  = ~Am I experiencing a case of déjà vu?~
@170  = ~Then the second of the Fyrra Vsevolod's retainers was taken to the evil Tarchion and was asked if he'd yield to Thay and kneel to Tarchion.. And Fyrra Vsevolod's second retainer answered that until the last drop of blood he will be loyal to Rashemen and will fight Thay. Then the evil Tarchion ordered the Fyrra's second retainer to be bled to death, and his body was thrown to jackals. ~
@171  = ~By the glory of Thay...~
@172  = ~Then the third of the Fyrra Vsevolod's retainers was taken to the evil Tarchion and was asked if he'd yield to Thay and kneel to Tarchion. And Fyrra Vsevolod's third retainer answered that until the last drop of blood he will be loyal to Rashemen and will fight Thay. Then the evil Tarchion ordered the Fyrra's third retainer to be bled to death, and his body was thrown to jackals.~
@173  = ~Incredible... and so refreshing after the story about the first and the second retainers...~
@174  = ~Then the fourth of the Fyrra Vsevolod's retainers was taken to the evil Tarchion and was asked if he'd yield to Thay and kneel to Tarchion. And Fyrra Vsevolod's fourth retainer answered that until the last drop of blood he will be loyal to Rashemen and will fight Thay. Then the evil Tarchion ordered the Fyrra's fourth retainer to be bled to death, and his body was thrown to jackals.~
@175  = ~Yes, yes, I see! Then the fifth of the Fyrra's Vsevolod's retainers was taken to the evil Tarchion...~
@176  = ~It's Minsc who is telling the story, wizard. So the fifth of the Fyrra's Vsevolod's retainers was taken to the evil Tarchion and was asked if he'd yield to Thay and kneel to Tarchion. And Fyrra Vsevolod's fifth retainer answered that until the last drop of blood he will be loyal to Rashemen and will fight Thay. Then the evil Tarchion ordered the Fyrra's fifth retainer to be bled to death, and his body was thrown to jackals.~
@177  = ~Yes... an unexpected twist. I... I need to attend to...~
@178  = ~Then the sixth of the Fyrra Vsevolod's retainers was taken to the evil Tarchion and was asked if he'd yield to Thay and kneel to Tarchion. And Fyrra Vsevolod's sixth retainer answered that until the last drop of blood he will be loyal to Rashemen and will fight Thay. Then the evil Tarchion ordered the Fyrra's sixth retainer to be bled to death, and his body was thrown to jackals.~
@179  = ~He cannot be stopped, he cannot be bargained with, he knows no mercy... Thankfully, Fyrra Vsevolod traveled with only a small retinue, and this shall all cease soon enough.~
@180  = ~Then the seventh of the Fyrra Vsevolod's retainers was taken to the evil Tarchion and was asked if he'd yield to Thay and kneel to Tarchion. And Fyrra Vsevolod's seventh retainer answered that until the last drop of blood he will be loyal to Rashemen and will fight Thay. Then the evil Tarchion ordered the Fyrra's seventh retainer to be bled to death, and his body was thrown to jackals.~
@181  = ~How very... educational. I am impressed at how bored I am. I have never been so bored in my entire life. The limits of known boredom have been expanded to previously unknown size, and the size of my brain is shrinking with each word you utter. (Incredible, yet true, alas. I shall be scarred for life.)~
@182  = ~Boo says that he does not sense that Edwin is convinced. *Minsc brightens up* But we can always tell you how brave Iron Lord Yegoriy Yasnoi, his four hundred fifty best and thirty Hathrans had died defending Citadel Rashemar from evil Thayvians...~
@183  = ~I... I am convinced that Rashemi have unyielding spirit. Perhaps you can submit me this story in writing, so I can pass it to my superiors. (Nevron will adore it, I am sure.)~
@184  = ~Oh... Minsc and Boo are not crazy enough to write down such a long story. But they can dictate to the evil wizard. Take out your quill! So once upon a time (Boo never had a head for dates) Iron Lord Yegoriy Yasnoi-~
@185  = ~Wherever Minsc and Boo go, evil trembles in its pants.~
@186  = ~Do you mean that evil gets fear-induced convulsions only in its lower body at your approach? Or do shivers gradually expand upwards from the knee caps?~
@187  = ~Minsc is confused, but Boo is quite sure that evil shivers all over at the sight of a mighty sword and sharp little teeth.~
@188  = ~Rashemi, you believe that your hamster is capable of making a choice between biting good and evil?~
@189  = ~Boo smells evil!~
@190  = ~Interesting phenomenon, if true. I should observe it more closely, I suppose.~
@191  = ~Garrick, you sing a different song every night. How did you get to know so many?~
@192  = ~Well, some I learned from other bards. But mostly bards like myself seek adventure throughout the Realms to make tales of their own.~
@193  = ~Minsc and Boo once wanted to write about our deeds, but halfway through we remembered that we couldn't write. And Dynaheir is too busy.~
@194  = ~Hey, I can help you! What was it about?~
@195  = ~Boo says it was about a big brave ranger and a hamster who saved little kids from a horde of ugly goblins.~
@196  = ~Wow! That sure sounds like a heroic story. Do you remember any of the details? I could pen a ballad for you. I think you'll serve as an... ahem... 'refreshing' variation on a valiant fighter type.~
@197  = ~Will you include Boo in the song? You know Minsc and Boo are Minsc and Boo...~
@198  = ~Oh, of course! How could I have Minsc without Boo? And don't worry, I'll be sure to mention all the advice he gives you, being a Miniature Giant Space Hamster and all.~
@199  = ~Boo approves heartily of your suggestion, little man!~
@200  = ~Yes, I'm sure he, uh, does.~
@201  = ~Minsc, lower your voice. You never know who might hear you in these woods, and I've grown tired of healing everyone on such constant basis.~
@202  = ~But Jaheira, Boo is missing!!!~
@203  = ~Don't tell me you misplaced him again. How did it happen this time?~
@204  = ~Well, when I woke up, he didn't greet me with his usual perkiness, but Minsc thought Boo was oversleeping. You know, nibbling on the eyes of villains is such a demanding task...~
@205  = ~PLEASE, don't mention that again. I have enough trouble eating after the last battle. I'll never be able to look at a rodent the way I did before.~
@206  = ~Boo will be pleased to find out that now you recognize the courage his kin displays in battle. But my little Boo is missing! He has left his pouch while I was sleeping, and now I can't find him! Please, Jaheira, you must help!~
@207  = ~Me? What do you expect me to do?~
@208  = ~You're a druid! Surely you would have some advice? Please, Jaheira, Minsc needs Boo! <CHARNAME> needs Boo! The entire party needs him, to help us in our glorious buttkicking quest! ~
@209  = ~Very well, Minsc, I'll help. Now please stop tugging at my bag!~
@210  = ~Who, me? But Minsc is over here, how could I...~
@211  = ~Don't tell me that... Boo!~
@212  = ~Boo? You already found Boo?! You are a great druid indeed, Jaheira!~
@213  = ~Here... take the filthy beast! He was hiding in my bag! And only Silvanus knows what damage he caused!~
@214  = ~Boo! Oh, you've been a naughty hamster, mister! Don't you ever scare Minsc like that!~
@215  = ~My medicinal plants! He ate all of my medicinal plants! You little pest! I should... I should...~
@216  = ~Boo says he's sorry. But he wanted a little snack, and since Minsc was asleep...~
@217  = ~Well, he WILL be sorry! I'd suspect he'll be needing potty breaks a lot the next few days. Maybe that will teach him to keep his nose out of other people's bags!~
@218  = ~Is that true, Boo?~
@219  = ~Quick, let's find you a bush! Try to hold it, Boo, try to... Yeack!~
@220  = ~Boo, do you smell this? It smells like bear, do you think there is a bear around? Or at least someone evil who needs a good butt kicking?~
@221  = ~Evil ones we will find aplenty and soon enough. As for beasts - this area is far too civilized to find a bear, unless it were caged so onlookers could stare at it.~
@222  = ~Why would they cage it? Minsc and Boo don't think it would be comfortable.~
@223  = ~Do you think they care about comfort? All they care about is getting gold.~
@224  = ~Why would a bear need gold?~
@225  = ~Not the bear, Minsc, the people who caged it! They will show it for the money.~
@226  = ~Oh, in Rashemen they often have bears dance at the fair... Boo says it's no different, but I'd rather dance then be in a cage. If I see one, I am going to make them to free it in any case!~
@227  = ~Erm... what's this under my feet again? Is that you, Boo?~
@228  = ~Minsc! Not again! Ye almost trampled me down in that last battle! Would it hurt you to be less of an oaf?~
@229  = ~Sorry, Kagain, sometimes Minsc forgets to look down.~
@230  = ~I bet there are a lot of things ye forget to do, like puttin' on yer head in the morning under yer helmet! Although I don't even want to know what ye were like when you could manage to form a thought.~
@231  = ~Minsc and Boo don't understand.~
@232  = ~Do you ever understand anything, ye fool of a human? Ye can swing that big sword of yers well enough, but apart from that, ye are a full lout, who uses that lump on his neck only to hang his helmet upon!~
@233  = ~Minsc has a lump on his neck? Must be a scar, aye? There is so much of Minsc that healers oft miss a wound or two on him. ~
@234  = ~Ye son of a drunk orc! I'm going to lose all of my wit, if I take it as habit to converse with ye.~
@235  = ~Whenever Minsc loses something, Boo finds it.~
@236  = ~Gah! Get away from me, before I plant me axe into ye!~
@237  = ~Khalid, how come you aren't a ranger?~
@238  = ~I... I am from a city. I am not v-very much at h-home in the wilderness, even if I feel at ease in the woods when Jaheira's about.~
@239  = ~Boo says all elves like nature.~
@240  = ~I... I am h-half-elf, Minsc.~
@241  = ~Boo wonders why they say a half-elf and not half-human...~
@242  = ~I d-don't know... half-orcs are also half-human. I suppose it p-prevents confusion.~
@243  = ~Ha! We thank you. Boo is a very curious space hamster, and you have answered him well.~
@244  = ~Friend Kivan, Boo thinks that Kivan should go to Rashemen with Minsc and Boo after the Iron Throne is kicked over by the mighty ranger's boots!~
@245  = ~Thank you for the invitation, Minsc, but I am otherwise engaged after our quest is over.~
@246  = ~Ah, nothing can be as important than returning a smile on your face. Rashemi girls know how to rekindle the warrior's spirit in a man's heart! Besides brewing the best spirit-~
@247  = ~Deheriana is the only woman for me, Minsc.~
@248  = ~Well, Boo says she is, well, dead.~
@249  = ~Perhaps Boo has not encountered elves before. My kin does not die, Minsc, not truly. They depart to a land far away-~
@250  = ~Rashemen is a land far away. Maybe Deheriana went there?~
@251  = ~Further away than Rashemen, Minsc.~
@252  = ~O! That's really far! Then you must hurry, or you'll never catch up with Deheriana!~
@253  = ~I am making haste, Minsc, but I cannot follow her until I have killed Tazok. It will be soon though, I feel it.~
@254  = ~Keep your distance, little halfling. Boo's clever nose has sniffed out your evil intent.~
@255  = ~He'd better keep 'is nose to 'imself, 'less he lose it! No one sniffs me and wakes up the next morn'!~
@256  = ~Monty's stench is enough to make one oversleep! So say Minsc and Boo!~
@257  = ~My name be not "Monty", ye daft barbarian! It be "Montaron"! Now leave me be, I've got a stew to make this evening, and I'll be contemplating the recipe!~
@258  = ~Errr... a stew? Does it have mushrooms? Boo loves mushrooms!~
@259  = ~I nay be cookin' fer yer rat! But yes, it be 'avin' mushrooms. They're the only thing ye can find in these woods. Unless ye'd like to hunt us a deer.~
@260  = ~Boo would never approve of Minsc killin' gentle forest creatures when there is other food in the pack.~
@261  = ~Then I guess ye'll be eatin dried meat again this eve'. Oh, and do ye know what kind of meat that is?~
@262  = ~Deer meat! Ha! I guess the only way out now would be to cook yer rodent!~
@263  = ~Minsc would never allow such a thing! Boo would very upset if he did! Mmm... say Montaron... can Minsc and Boo have some of that mushroom stew this evening?~
@264  = ~Yes, yes, ye can! Now shut yer pie-hole and let me think! So... one ounce of pepper... two spoons of salt... or was it three? Damn, where's aunt Gertrude when ye need 'er?!~
@265  = ~Ssshhh, Boo, let's move away, before we end up with an empty stomach this eve'. What's that? But I love them, too!~
@266  = ~Oh, very well, you can have the big ones. Now let's go and scout ahead.~
@267  = ~Yes, and look for mushrooms...~
@268  = ~Quick, friend Quayle, hide behind Minsc's back! Or maybe Boo's back, since Quayle is such a small man.~
@269  = ~A man's worthiness is determined by the size of his brain and his nose, not by his overall... bulkiness. Erm... Minsc, I do not like to shout the words of wisdom, so do me a favor, bend when I am addressing to you.~
@270  = ~Minsc is already kneeling, but Minsc can lay down to talk to the short Vremyonni.~
@271  = ~Vremy-what?~
@272  = ~Great idea, Boo! Minsc will send Boo to talk to Vremyonni, since Minsc always falls asleep while the sages speak anyway...~
@273  = ~Uhm, Minsc, who's Vremyonni?~
@274  = ~Why, you are, Master Quayle!~
@275  = ~No, Boo, Quayle is not a witch... What? Gnomish girls have beards? Just like dwarves? Hmmm... Master... erm... Quayle, you are not a witch, are you?~
@276  = ~I am not a witch! I am a man, you blind oaf of a hamster!~
@277  = ~Then you are Vremyonni. Hide!~
@278  = ~What? Where? Why? Oh...~
@279  = ~Yes, Boo, strange people, but that's why they are foreigners, aye. In Rashemen, if a man can become a wizard, but does not want to - he goes into exile, but Master Quayle here is a mage, but he is in exile. And he walks unprotected, Boo, and in plain sight! This makes Minsc's head hurt.~
@280  = ~Wait, my enormous intellect found the light where an average man would walk for ages in darkness. Amongst Rashemi men-wizards are called Vremyonni, and women - Wychlaran... and it seems that your people take great care to protect either sort... Who would believe that such enlightened customs are spread amongst the wild Easterlings?~
@281  = ~You are really almost as smart as Boo, Quayle! Even if you do not want to hide, you surely do not want to miss the opportunity to speak to another sage and learn from Boo's wisdom, so fall back and worry not about foes - Minsc scouts the path and guards you both.~
@282  = ~Alas, being a giant of mind, I allow my thoughts to run too quick. I need to rethink my statement about the Easterlings in light of my latest discovery that one of their kind believes my amazing intellectual capacity below that of a vulgar hamster.~
@283  = ~Stop pushing that rodent of unusual size into my hood, Minsc! It tickles! Ay-ay-ay!~
@284  = ~Safana, why is it that men are always looking at you?~
@285  = ~*gives him an innocent smile* Why, what do you mean, Minsc?~
@286  = ~Minsc and Boo have noticed that men keep on looking at your chest, as if they are trying to find something hidden there...~
@287  = ~Oh, that? Minsc, darling, men cannot possibly miss a rare opportunity to steal a look at the most charming and elegant female in the whole of Faerun. Inadvertently they all fall under my spell.~
@288  = ~Spells? Boo says only priests and mages have spells.~
@289  = ~Those are other kinds of spells, Minsc. Let me tell you a story or two to explain how it works...~
@290  = ~You're a funny, little man, Tiax. You really make Minsc laugh.~
@291  = ~What?!! Tiax is not funny! Tiax is great and all powerful! You will all bow one day before the will of Tiax, as the One, the All, the majestic Cyric raises him to his destined place!~
@292  = ~You?! You will rule the world?~
@293  = ~Yes, you infidel! I'll make rivers of milk and honey flow from my toes, break winds of pure perfume, and beautiful maidens shall feed me grapes in golden chalices, as I pass judgement on poor infidels like you!~
@294  = ~Minsc has no need of milk and honey, if they come from your toes! Who would want that? Just look at them, they're filthy!~
@295  = ~And you know why, oh, you who shall suffer a thousand deaths because your blind eyes couldn't discern my greatness?~
@296  = ~Well... because you are a stinky little gnome, too lazy to take a bath?~
@297  = ~Yes, Boo, I'll tell him. And would you please be so kind as to move a few feet downwind? Boo has a very sensitive nose, and those weeds you smoke really make his eyes water.~
@298  = ~Infidel! You and your rodent know nothing! Cyric himself spoke to Tiax, ordering him to avoid the foul water, so I can resemble my god in his holy lack of bathing!~
@299  = ~Err... he did that? Truly then, the Shattered Castle must stink up the Planes!~
@300  = ~It's only for the purpose to make the false gods desert them in the hands of Cyric! He told me Himself in one of the many encounters we have when I smoke the sweet essence of Black Lotus!~
@301  = ~Minsc and Boo are amazed that with one such as you running around, people would find *us* strange.~
@302  = ~Come, Boo, let's leave the crazy gnome alone, before the stench of his pipe weed gives us a headache.~
@303  = ~Tiax, Boo wonders, why do you continue to stare at him?~
@304  = ~Tiax does not stare! Tiax *glares* at those who are not hasty enough to submit to his will!~
@305  = ~Boo will never submit to anyone. His mighty warrior spirit is unyielding!~
@306  = ~All will yield to Tiax. Boo will preach the word of Cyric in no time!~
@307  = ~Boo does not take to the way of words, he understands the way of the butt kicking for goodness! Well, he cannot actually kick much, but his teeth and claws are the sharpest weapons that serve goodness.~
@308  = ~Boo shall do what Tiax says. But Tiax can use an extra set of teeth and claws to advance his purpose of dominating the world. You, big one, surrender the hamster to Cyric's cause!~
@309  = ~By the Three! I will not allow to separate Minsc and Boo! Minsc and Boo are Minsc and Boo, maybe Boo and Minsc, but never just Minsc, or just Boo!~
@310  = ~Viconia, Minsc and Boo noticed that many boots chased after you. Boo can defend you.~
@311  = ~I request not additional protection from round-ear vermin... Begone, jaluk! I entrusted myself to Shar; she alone is my strength.~
@312  = ~...and <CHARNAME>, of course... but I would not apply for help from a hamster!~
@313  = ~Aye, alone, that's just the thing. See, there are two of Minsc and Boo, and only one Dynaheir to defend against foes. We need to take others under our protective wings... erm, that sounds wrong... protective paws! Boo needs his dajemma task set to him...~
@314  = ~I assure you... protective paws? Are you mad? Oh, why am I even asking? The man holds a hamster in higher esteem than a jalil!~
@315  = ~Well, boots are for kicking and... well, hand and paws are what keep those in need of protection behind our heroic backs!~
@316  = ~So no harm will come to them.~
@317  = ~I do not trust your kind; I have received naught but misery and humiliation from humans. Why would you protect me?~
@318  = ~Because you are a nice gal, and cannot wield a sword if your life depended on it! Well, not a real sword like mine at any rate...~
@319  = ~Phew, I can wield a real enough flail, human, and I promise I shall use it to crush your little vermin, if you dare to place me behind him.~
@320  = ~Ah, such a spirited gal our Viconia is, right, Boo? She is a good gal, just does not know of it... we will make a ranger out of her yet!~
@321  = ~Yes, Boo, you can guard her... from afar.~
@322  = ~Friend Xan, lighten up! Why are you always sulking? It's a fine day, and more heroics lie ahead! Oh, the bards will sing of us, as we march towards another righteous butt-kicking, and we...~
@323  = ~...freeze to death every night, or narrowly avoid sunstroke by day. Get soaked in every rain, and risk catching malaria from mosquito bites. Not to mention all those monsters and brigands, who seem only to try to come up with more and more imaginative ways of ending our lives.~
@324  = ~Aaaah, friend Xan is always so gloomy. All the things you mention amount to nothing, compared with the pleasure of squishing evil under the boot of goodness, as we...~
@325  = ~*sighs* And when mosquitoes are not enough, we get flies. Leave me be, you bloodthirsty winged beasts of thousand eyes!~
@326  = ~Flies? Maybe friend Xan has stepped into some evil? Flies are attracted to evil, you know.~
@327  = ~Excuse me?!~
@328  = ~I noticed a pile of evil dung some ways back. Keep a vigilant eye, friend Xan, less your goody shoes become marred by the foul odor of villainy!~
@329  = ~Mmmmph!~
@330  = ~What was that? Was gloomy Xan smiling?~
@331  = ~*sighs*~
@332  = ~He was! Look Boo, we made Xan smile!~
@333  = ~I was not smiling... rather, scowling. Our situation is hopeless, why should I do such a frivolous thing as smiling? Now let me be, good Minsc, I need to... to... study my spellbook.~
@334  = ~Sure. Minsc and Boo will scout ahead to warn the party of evil sticky dung on the road.~
@335  = ~Friend Xan, do you trust Minsc?~
@336  = ~What? Why would you ask such a thing?~
@337  = ~Please, just answer Minsc.~
@338  = ~Well... you're not so bad, for a human. Too bad you'll end up as a casualty of our hopeless cause, which, as I pointed out before, has every chance to...~
@339  = ~Yes, yes. Please give Minsc your hand, and close your eyes.~
@340  = ~Minsc, what's come over you? Let go of me!~
@341  = ~Please, no peeking.~
@342  = ~*he sighs* Very well, but you should know your behavior starts to worry me more each day. Perhaps you should...~
@343  = ~Here. Feel the furry bundle of goodness that is Boo, and let his hamster fuzziness clear away your troubles. Smile, little wizard, for no troubles can resist the soothing touch of a hamster!~
@344  = ~What?! Let me go, you deceiver, let me go!~
@345  = ~Boo, your powers seem to have been too much for the little elf. Look, how he dances around, after you have freed his mind of worries!~
@346  = ~What were you doing? Are you trying to kill me? Corellon, have pity on me! Please, don't let me catch the plague!~
@347  = ~Oh, no need to thank Minsc. Boo was the one that brought you such joy.~
@348  = ~Joy?! You call THIS joy?!! Have you any idea what diseases I might get from touching that rodent?! Oh, Corellon, I need to wash my hands! They're starting to itch! A... a... a... AT-CHA! AT-CHA!~
@349  = ~Yes Boo, he seems livelier than ever. Look, he's turning red from excitement, and his whole body seems to puff with merriment. Oh, you'll get some extra nuts tonight, mister... You certainly deserve them.~
@350  = ~Xzar, I simply cannot fathom how you justify spending a lifetime - your life - in the study of death and decay.~
@351  = ~Aaaaaieee! Stop touching me!~
@352  = ~Nobody is touching the mad wizard! See, Boo is back in his pouch!~
@353  = ~Yes, me crazy crazy crazy, me mad mad mad! Oh, sweet lollypop seeds that stuck in your teeth!~
@354  = ~Eh?... Oh, I see, Boo. Minsc feels sorry for Xzar, because he too was mad before meeting you. Maybe some of your relatives could help him?~
@355  = ~You were crazy, too? Tell me, tell me... how did Boo manage to get rid of... ssshh, they mustn't hear us... those... those DRAGONS WITH FEET LIKE RABBITS?!!! They just keep coming, and coming... Aaaaieee!~
@356  = ~Hey! Let go of Boo! Keep your hands to yourself! Let go, or Minsc will crush!~
@357  = ~Ouch!~
@358  = ~There! See what you did? You forced Boo to show you his mighty warrior spirit! Yes, Boo, I know, this wizard's mind is even farther than the stars you came from. Let's just leave him alone, shall we?~
@359  = ~Minsc is so lucky that Boo found him, or else Minsc might have ended like this. Thank you, Boo! Do you want some nuts?~ [GAM_48]
