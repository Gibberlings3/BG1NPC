@0    = ~But Keeper! Gorion and <CHARNAME> were attacked just outside the keep, near the Coastway. Gorion... he... he's dead. <CHARNAME> just managed to escape. I saw it all!~
@1    = ~Don't you think you could make an exception? You've known <CHARNAME> for years!~
@2    = ~I... I am saddened to hear of Gorion's death, <CHARNAME>. Your father was a good man and my friend. I'll inform the most high Ulraunt and Tethtoril of his passing. This is grave news indeed. However, I do hope you understand that I just cannot allow you in, <CHARNAME>. My hands are tied in this matter.~
@3    = ~I could really use your help. I have no home, no guardian, and I need to get to the Friendly Arm Inn.~
@4    = ~I do not believe that you will not let me return. At least let Imoen in... I don't want her around.~
@5    = ~You have no right to bar my path.~
@6    = ~I think Gorion would have wished to be buried in Candlekeep. Could you arrange it?~
@7    = ~I will return to the Golden Way to bury my mentor myself. Imoen, though, may want to stay here. Will you let her, if she wants to?~
@8    = ~We will send a search party and Gorion will be interred properly. I wish that I could do more for you...~
@9    = ~Perhaps I can help in some small way. Here, please take this. It's not much, but I hope it will be of some assistance.~
@10   = ~Imoen, you, however, are free to enter if you wish. Winthrop is quite worried over your disappearance.~
@11   = ~Oh, no! <CHARNAME> and I are in this together, through thick and thin! Puffguts has my letter. And he taught me a thing or two... ol' Imoen can stay outta trouble!~
@12   = ~Tell him I love him, though, will ya? And tell him not to worry 'bout little old me.~
@13   = ~I will, Imoen. Take care, both of you. And <CHARNAME>? Be wary of strangers, and don't be too quick to give out your name. Just a bit of advice. Safe travels.~
@14   = ~Whate'er you decide, I'm with ya, <CHARNAME>!~
@15   = ~Huh, this man gave me the creeps. I mean, pickin' a pocket is one thing, but killin' a dozen workers to steal some stupid artifact is... horrible!~
@16   = ~Hey, back off! We did nothin' wrong!~
@17   = ~I'm glad ya agreed ta help out, <CHARNAME>. By Mask, I hoped enough times that someone'd bail *me* outta trouble when I was of an age with Varci!~
@18   = ~O, sorry for scarin' your son an' all, ma'am. Hope he's alright! Ya tell him that some adventurers do good things, like helpin' other folk at need.~
@19   = ~Firewine Bridge... that sounds familiar... where did I hear it? Uhm... In any case, ruins are ALWAYS full of treasure! And since we're experienced adventurers, we've nothin' ta worry about. Let's go there one day.~
@20   = ~Heya, Mr. E! Remember me? I'm the *second* kid of Candlekeep. We're goin' ta get ya book, no problem...~
@21   = ~Imoen! Glad to see you, lass. Forgive me for not recognizing you immediately; but you have changed!~
@22   = ~Sure thin', sir! No more aprons and bonnets for Imoen the Magnificent. Well, unless someone offers me a dragon's treasure horde to wear one.~
@23   = ~We're goin' ta get ya book, no problem, Mr. E... ~
@24   = ~It's good to see a familiar face, eh, <CHARNAME>?~
@25   = ~One thing I've learned is that you hear more interesting stories on the road than staying in an inn. *sighs* When I was er... staying in the inn, as soon as some traveller from afar would start a good tale, everyone else would shout for ale and food... and I never would hear the whole story. I had to fill in all the missin' bits on my own.~
@26   = ~Less than brilliant?! Tee-hee, it's good t'adventure with friends! At least ya wouldn't call me 'less than brilliant' and get away with it!~
@27   = ~Girl, your chattering is giving me a headache.~
@28   = ~Garrick is not little! Good thing ya're an actress, not a painter; would have been a problem bein' blind, huh. 'Cause if ya don't see for yourself how tall he is, ya sure are blind!~
@29   = ~Of course!~
@30   = ~I mean, <CHARNAME>, he can join us, right? *giggles* He is cute, and he is a real bard! Someone's gotta write ballads about my beauty and bravery, ya know?~
@31   = ~You... you truly think that I am... er... cute?~
@32   = ~Yeah, that was a real rotten thing she tricked <CHARNAME> into doing!~
@33   = ~You'll be much better off with us...~
@34   = ~<CHARNAME>, he can join us, right? *giggles* He is cute and he is a real bard! Someone's gotta write ballads about my beauty and bravery, ya know?~
@35   = ~Isn't it great, <CHARNAME>? We made it through the forest full of gibberlings and wolves, and now we are meeting *real* adventurers! Things are lookin' up!~
@36   = ~Hey, Auntie Jaheira, I am Imoen! A friend of <CHARNAME>'s... Actually, more like a guardian than a friend, ya know? Lookin' after <PRO_HIMHER>, and all that.~
@37   = ~Adventurers generally do not call each other 'auntie', Imoen. But enough distractions. Gorion had mentioned you in his correspondence, praising your fast friendship with his ward. You are welcome to come along.~
@38   = ~Nope! But from the look of ya they must be on the dreadfully borin' side!~
@39   = ~Of course we will bash some heads for ya! If ya want, we can make 'em hobgoblins come back t'ya and say they're sorry they took ya father's ring!~
@40   = ~*pushes you in the ribs* Our finesse is unappreciated here, my good <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@41   = ~Hey, ya know what? <CHARNAME> over 'ere was just locked out of <PRO_HISHER> home-town without a penny, and some monsters killed <PRO_HISHER> father. If anyone here should be jumping cliffs, it's <PRO_HIMHER>! And d'ya see <PRO_HIMHER> jumpin'? So what's yer problem?~
@42   = ~Heh. What a queer fellow.~
@43   = ~I'm glad you tried to talk him outta it, <CHARNAME>, even if he was just lookin' for attention.~
@44   = ~Ya could of at least tried to talk him out of it, <CHARNAME>, even if he was just lookin' for attention.~
@45   = ~Another caravan raided?! Wow, that's no good! Remember those Flamin' Fists passin' by Candlekeep last week? They said there was at least two missing! I think we should keep our eyes peeled, or we'll be killed by bandits fer nothin'!~
@46   = ~Excitin' though... Caravans, bandits, road... like an adventure from a book!~
@47   = ~Heya, I'm Imoen, and that's my friend <CHARNAME>. We just got out of Candlekeep, and are startin' out on a grand adventure, avenging that great mage and all... uhm, <CHARNAME>, why are ya standing with your mouth shut as a clam when the tide is out? Ya know more than I 'bout that fightin' thing, anyway. So go tell 'bout it! That's what adventurers do! Famous ones, anyway. Or how would they ever get into bards' songs?~
@48   = ~Ya hear him? 'Like-minded companions'! That'd be me! Yer doin' alright, despite bein' thicker than Candlekeep's walls! Imoen the Magnificent is gonna make an adventurer out of ya yet!~
@49   = ~Heh, I... or do I need ta say "Ti"? I mean if "you" is "thou"... or was it "thee"? Uhm... in any case I'm not desperate and not deranged. I'm excited! I am going to be a famous adventurer, like Elminster!~
@50   = ~*smiles from behind his moustache* Thou art a spirited girl, Imoen. Now what of thy companion?~
@51   = ~Wait, wait! How d'ya know my name?~
@52   = ~One can acquire such knowledge in more ways than one, child. But let the quiet one speak.~
@53   = ~Psst, <CHARNAME>, the mage speaks like he's layin' honey on bread, but I dunno... I don't like his eyes a single bit!~
@54   = ~Um, <CHARNAME>, shouldn't we go to the Friendly Arm Inn first? We should probably find Gorion's friends, like he wanted you to.~
@55   = ~I don't like the looks of these two jokers, <CHARNAME>. Nope. I don't. Not at all.~
@56   = ~Let's get to the Friendly Arm Inn soon, huh? I'd like to have some people I can trust travelling with us.~
@57   = ~Hey, ya grouch... we weren't shoutin' at all. We are adventurers and understand such things, ya know. Tell him, <CHARNAME>.~
@58   = ~Nine Hells, it's good ta be home! Winthrop, my ol' man!~
@59   = ~An' you, littl' missus, owe me a long account, for all my worries after you had run off!~
@60   = ~I do... *her eyes water* I know... Oh, damn, I'm so glad to se ya, Puffguts!~
@61   = ~Puffguts, <PRO_HESHE> hasn't changed a touch! And we've been up to... up to so many things... I promise I'll come tell ya all that this bore would miss out!~
@62   = ~Ya do that, my dear, ya sure'd do that.~
@63   = ~*giggles* It's sure fun ta see <PRO_HIMHER> jump at an innocent joke... Just like good ol' times...~
@64   = ~Oh, Hull, so many things have happened since... both good and bad... but nothin' was worse than ol' Gorion's being killed. <CHARNAME>, I think we should drink to his memory, while we're here in Candlekeep with our friends.~
@65   = ~*A* tale?! Thousands, more like! The things we've seen and done... would get even Nessa excited!~
@66   = ~We sure know what we're doin'! And take it from me, Fuller, those Iron Throne people are the villains here!~
@67   = ~Poor lad. I think we should go help him. It reminds me of when we were kids in Candlekeep, and you'd run away scared of the dogs, when they'd bark.~
@68   = ~What kinda freak would want some gold, and then run away like a madwoman once she was offered money? ~
@69   = ~What in the Hells is her problem? I can't believe she'd get so worked up 'bout not telling ya 'bout yer past, an' all. Why'd she go and attack us, instead of jus' running away? ~
@70   = ~Hold on here, <CHARNAME>! Since when did you become a follower of the Crying God? What's more, since when do ya go around saying we're *all* followers of Ilmater? I certainly am not! But er... whatever floats yer boat.~
@71   = ~*smacks <CHARNAME> on the head* Idiot! Why didn't you consult with me, first? Didn't ya think for a moment he might be tryin' to scam ya? I should know, after all.~
@72   = ~*smacks <CHARNAME> on the head* Idiot! Why did you buy that? Are you dense or something? Didn't ya think for a moment he might be tryin' to scam ya? And that's after boasting how clever a thief you're an'all!~
@73   = ~Can you say creeeeeeeeepy...~
@74   = ~Whoa! That's some really creepy magic there!~
@75   = ~Ugh! My head hurts just trying ta make sense of what you're sayin' about this... Kozah. But, um, I guess he was some evil god, and this place has something ta do with him, like a temple, right?~
@76   = ~Yes. Basically you're right. What of it?~
@77   = ~So those workers we just killed attacked us cuz of him or somethin' or another, right? Well then, how come none of us were affected, huh?~
@78   = ~I am unable to answer your question. We know little of this culture, and that is why I was doing research. I doubt that I would ever have an answer for you, Imoen.~
@79   = ~So those workers we just killed attacked us cuz of him or somethin' or another, right? Well then, how come none of us were affected, huh?~
@80   = ~Wow, we are famous, <CHARNAME>!~
@81   = ~Tymora's luck, but yer a creep! And to think that I wanted ta be a mage! Brr...~
@82   = ~*rubs her head* I'm gettin' a headache, listening to this guy. I thought we left all those borin' lectures at Candlekeep.~
@83   = ~That is creepy. I definitely don't wanna have anyone copy me! I'm the only one allowed to be Imoen after all.~
@84   = ~Yeah. One of you is more than enough.~
@85   = ~Don't worry. Who would want to copy you, anyway?~
@86   = ~Don't worry. I won't let that happen.~
@87   = ~Hey! What's that s'posed to mean?~
@88   = ~Thanks. You better not attack the wrong one, though. Got it?~
@89   = ~Don't worry. No one would be able to mistake some copy for the real you.~
@90   = ~Don't worry. I'd know the real one from a shapeshifter copy any day.~
@91   = ~Somehow that doesn't make me feel better, y'know.~
@92   = ~Thanks. That makes me feel a little better. I'll do the same for you, 'kay?~
@93   = ~*whispering* Hey, <CHARNAME>. Why did you agree to work with this guy? He seems, well, creepy.~
@94   = ~I heard that, rogue. It is none of your concern, as the matter was settled between <CHARNAME> and myself.~
@95   = ~I dunno 'bout this guy. I mean his scheme isn't all that terribly bad or anything, but I get the feeling he's not tellin' us everything.~
@96   = ~Huh, someone is grumpy today. Must have gotten up on the wrong side o' the bed or somethin'.~
@97   = ~Ugh! I'll leave this one to <CHARNAME>. I was never good at this kind of riddle.~
@98   = ~Ewww... gross! I feel sick all of a sudden.~
@99   = ~Well, seems like those other gnolls wanna keep Dynaheir alive for a bit longer at least, so... um, I guess that's good news, huh, Minsc?~
@100  = ~Good news! Minsc's witch lives! My boot is itching to kill the evil gnolls and free magnificent Dynaheir from their evil ways! Raaagh!~
@101  = ~Yeah! Uncle Khalid and Auntie Jaheira are coming with us! This is going to be a great adventure, after all!~
@102  = ~*sigh*~
@103  = ~What?! Wait a second here! Why did we come all this way, and now you're turning your back on them? They're like our family, y'know!~
@104  = ~I have my reasons.~
@105  = ~I don't want to get them involved. They have enough to worry about.~
@106  = ~Guess halflings really are sensitive about their height.~
@107  = ~Some of us are, especially with humans. Don't worry, though. I won't get upset if you call me 'shorty', Imoen, as long as I can call you 'Little Imoen', or maybe 'Little Immy'. Yeah, I like that last one better.~
@108  = ~So, um, why do halflings hate kobolds so much?~
@109  = ~Do we really need a reason ta hate someone?~
@110  = ~Well, they are filthy and dirty creatures. They try taking our land from us, and then they're just evil. Do you really need any more reasons?~
@111  = ~Well, I guess not. But it seems kinda much. I mean humans hate orcs and stuff, but not to the extent you guys seem to hate kobolds.~
@112  = ~It goes back a ways, Imoen. I don't think I'm the halfling you should be asking about this. I'm sorry.~
@113  = ~Yer pourin' oil on the coals here, sis. <CHARNAME> has the temperament of a wild cat!~
@114  = ~Yer pourin' oil on the coals here, sis. <CHARNAME> has the temperament of a wild bull!~
@115  = ~Hey, slow down! It's not like you look any different!~
@116  = ~Okay. This I gotta see. Err, hear.~
@117  = ~A new world!? Wow! That sounds so exciting! I'd like to go there someday!~
@118  = ~Come on, Imoen! I thought you were smarter than that! He's just pulling your leg.~
@119  = ~I still say he's got his facts messed up somehow. A new world there may be, but his explanation is that of a lunatic.~
@120  = ~I don't know about that. Maybe there is a new world on the other side, maybe there isn't. I doubt we'll ever know, let alone set foot on it.~
@121  = ~Well, if what he says is true, perhaps someday we will set foot on it. I'd like to, as well.~
@122  = ~I dunno. He sounded kinda serious.~
@123  = ~Of course! How else is he to fool simpletons?~
@124  = ~Yeah, maybe because he's a raving loon!~
@125  = ~Perhaps. But I highly doubt it.~
@126  = ~Well... maybe yer right. That did kinda sound farfetched, what he said.~
@127  = ~*sigh* Yea. I guess yer right. It's really a shame, though. Really.~
@128  = ~I'd really like to see what could be on an unexplored area of this world! Maybe they have a race of humans with pink hair! Wouldn't that be the greatest!?~
@129  = ~That's the spirit! No place is too remote! No place too unknown! No place too dangerous for us!~
@130  = ~Well, as long as there's a place where a girl can freshen up from time to time at least.~
@131  = ~Anyway...~
@132  = ~Well I gue-~
@133  = ~*elbows <CHARNAME>* I am not a *simpleton*!~
@134  = ~*giggles* Naked without his dagger? I'd say so! These miners, they don't wear much, huh.~
@135  = ~Wow, <CHARNAME>, we're freeing the slaves, just like heroes in the songs!~
@136  = ~Hold on! I think we should help them out, but aren't we gonna kill the guards here anyway? Why d'we need to pay him? They'll be free once all the guards here are dead, anyway. I mean, it's not like we have funds to spare, y'know.~
@137  = ~But uhm... they can use it, poor men. *sighs* You're a kind <PRO_MANWOMAN>, that's why I like ya.~
@138  = ~Whatcha do that for? We're no guards, but well, I guess I don't really like the term mercenaries, either.~
@139  = ~You didn't have to be so stingy. I mean, I like keeping the money I have, but it was only a hundred coins, and it was for a good cause. You're really a miser if you won't help them out when we have that kinda money!~
@140  = ~There. Don't worry, lady. We'll try and save Brage for you, 'kay?~
@141  = ~Poor woman. I feel sorry for her, even if she did attack us. She was only trying to protect someone she cared for, even if it was misguided.~
@142  = ~Wow. A damsel in distress, and a brave warrior to come rescue her. I wish that would happen to me.~
@143  = ~Actually, no, I don't. I don't mind the brave warrior, as long as he's handsome, but the part about being in danger I could do without.~
@144  = ~Minsc will rescue a nice girl like you, fear not! But now it's glorious Dynaheir that we need to rescue! Onward, friends!~
@145  = ~Maybe you'll get lucky someday. ~
@146  = ~Hey, you got me!~
@147  = ~*giggles* Heh. You really are a kidder! I was talking about someone more romantic than you. ~
@148  = ~*giggles* Didn't I just say that I don't want it, silly?~
@149  = ~See, aren't ya glad you listened to my idea to bring him here, instead of turning him in for the bounty? Now we've gotten double the reward money!~
@150  = ~Hey, that was my idea!~
@151  = ~Heh. Yeah, you're right, Imoen. Glad I took *your* advice.~
@152  = ~I think you got it backwards. *You* wanted the money for his bounty.~
@153  = ~Heh. Yeah, I'll let you believe that.~
@154  = ~Thank you again for your help.~
@155  = ~I don't think I like the way ya said that...~
@156  = ~Me? Yeah, I like money and all, but not at the expense of some innocent person's life. Even I have ta draw the line somewhere, y'know.~
@157  = ~I don't know where ya got this crazy idea from, but it's not funny.~
@158  = ~Good timin' is everything in the adventurin' profession.~
@159  = ~Uhm, yeah... Are all mages like that? If I were one, I wouldn't work with some slime and ooze... Brrr... It's too uhm... slimy. I'd create candy golems or somethin', if I wanted to be weird.~
@160  = ~He's right. Yer even startin' to creep me out now.~
@161  = ~Aghh! Will you shut this moron up, already! What does a girl have ta do to get some peace and quiet around here!~
@162  = ~'Nough already!!! Outta my way! Let me at him! He's driving me insane!!!~
@163  = ~FINALLY! I swear, if he said one more thing, I was going to kill him!~
@164  = ~Why does everyone get angry with me? I'm only trying to be friendly!~
@165  = ~Creeeepppy. I hope we never end up being tortured like that.~
@166  = ~Hold on here a sec! What the hell are ya talkin' about? What kinda reputation you trying to give me, huh?~
@167  = ~Yeah! You go walk away, you charlatan!~
@168  = ~I can say things like that, link it to some mumbo-jumbo about star alignments and other stuff too, you know, and make it sound just vague enough to cover almost any circumstance.~
@169  = ~Wait a second here... hmm...~
@170  = ~I can say things like that, link it to some mumbo-jumbo about star alignments and other stuff too, you know, and make it sound just vague enough to cover almost any circumstance. ~
@171  = ~You don't really believe that, do ya, <CHARNAME>?~
@172  = ~Huh, this guy throws a hissy fit 'cause a few words broke the silence of the woods? I wanna see him in Puffguts' kitchens on the night of the Midsummer feast! He'd probably lose his mind and start screaming or somethin'. Heh, he'd fit right in!~
@173  = ~Wow, this is beautiful! D'ya think someone'll make our statues one day, <CHARNAME>? Seeing how we're 'bout to become great heroes and all?~
@174  = ~*kicks you really hard* You stupid monkey! What did you do that for! We could have easily taken him. Next time, we come across some kind of bandits like them, I'll be the negotiator, y'hear? ~
@175  = ~Did ya hear that!? Sarevok! Sounds kinda fishy to me, dontcha think?~
@176  = ~Wait! What the... Come on, how many thieves are there in this party, and we still get robbed that easily? Not my fault, though. Someone else had to insist <PRO_HESHE> could keep it safer than me.~
@177  = ~Wait! What the... I should have seen this coming. Letting you keep the money while we were at the carnival was a bad idea. But no... someone had to insist <PRO_HESHE> could keep it safer than me, the one who knows what to look for!~
@178  = ~To think all he wanted was a book so he could teach. Makes you kinda wonder.~
@179  = ~Oh! <CHARNAME>, you'll get whatever I want so I can rest in peace if I die, right?~
@180  = ~Someone really needs to give him a clue!~
@181  = ~Where?!~
@182  = ~Oh, Hades, he picked your pocket, <CHARNAME>, while ya were gawkin' 'round!~
@183  = ~Huh, so much ado 'bout some stupid boots! And ya know what, <CHARNAME>, in those boots he'd only become better at stealin', so let's keep our eyes on our money while we're 'round here.~
@184  = ~Oh, look who's all important now!~
@185  = ~And what about me? Hmm? ~
@186  = ~I couldn't stop you from coming, even if I tried.~
@187  = ~Someone has to baby-sit you.~
@188  = ~*sticks out her tongue* Is that so? We'll just see who has to sleep outdoors next time with a large rock under them!~
@189  = ~That's right! But it's for your own good, ya know.~
@190  = ~Can we go there someday? Huh, <CHARNAME>? It sounds like fun!~
@191  = ~Absolutely not!~
@192  = ~Perhaps. We'll have to see what fortune favors.~
@193  = ~Of course! I wouldn't miss it for the world!~
@194  = ~Boo! You're no fun! I thought we were s'posed to be adventuring!~
@195  = ~Great! That means I'll have ta start making plans for it!~
@196  = ~Wow! And Winthrop used ta tell me that diamonds don't grow on trees! Sure, in Candlekeep they don't! Hey, <CHARNAME>, cheer up! Tymora favors us, seems ta me.~
@197  = ~Is that... Gorion?~
@198  = ~Yes. He died saving me from some... thing.~
@199  = ~Yes, it *was* Gorion. He died while protecting me from an attack.~
@200  = ~*push the body with a toe of your foot* Right. The *great* mage Gorion! Could not even stand his ground against a couple of ogres and a scare-crow!~
@201  = ~Hey! You were hiding yer butt under a bush while he was fighting all these monsters, weren't ya?~
@202  = ~Don'tcha even know what attacked you? Whatever it was, looks like it was vicious.~
@203  = ~I was scared out of my wits! What do you expect?~
@204  = ~It was too dark to see much, but it was humanoid, although I couldn't see a face. His eyes glowed, though... like hells' fire! And he would have gone straight for me if Gorion, gods rest his soul, had not barred his way!~
@205  = ~I can't remember much about last night... or... much about the attacker. But I do remember that he... that it spoke.~
@206  = ~Ogres, some girl with a mace, and a huge man in spiked armor. I did not stick around long enough to take a closer look, you know. With Gorion shouting at me to run, that man demanding my head and all...~
@207  = ~Really? I'm glad I wasn't right there. I've seen you get surprised and jump before, but never ever afraid. I-I don't even want to think 'bout what could scare you.~
@208  = ~I see. Hmm... so he wasn't after Gorion, but you.~
@209  = ~So ya remember what it said?~
@210  = ~Not really, just that it wanted to kill me.~
@211  = ~Well, it did not say much... besides, obviously, wanting my corpse to be where Gorion's is now, or at least alongside it, it mentioned it had been looking for me.~
@212  = ~I don't like this, <CHARNAME>, don't like it at all.~
@213  = ~I don't either, but I have to find out what's going on, and why I was attacked. I don't want to drag you into this, though, Imoen.~
@214  = ~I don't either, but what's done is done. Gorion's spirit won't come back now. I doubt even a High Cleric of Helm could restore him to life with a body this torn up. No, we'd best move on now, Imoen.~
@215  = ~I didn't want Gorion to die, but I will avenge him, Imoen. Just you wait.~
@216  = ~Heh, things are just starting to get interesting. Don't get me wrong, I wish Gorion were here, but this is how great adventures start, Imoen!~
@217  = ~Have I asked your opinion, brat?~
@218  = ~Nope, 'cause you're so stupid!~
@219  = ~That seemed obvious, from what you've said earlier.~
@220  = ~*shrugging her shoulders and grinning* Well, we'll just have ta deal with 'em when they come again, but this time, it'll be their bodies rottin' in the sun.~
@221  = ~Well, aren't ya the popular one?~
@222  = ~Sorry, just tryin' to liven things up here. Anyways, if that thing was lookin' for ya, it'll come for ya 'gain. Don'tcha worry, though! This time, with Imoen the Magnificent at your side, you can't lose!~
@223  = ~Heh. Thanks, Imoen.~
@224  = ~Imoen the *Mag*nificent?~
@225  = ~Magnificent? You're okay, but I wouldn't go that far.~
@226  = ~And can Imoen the Magnificent liven up *this* thing here? *point at Gorion's body*~
@227  = ~Leave? And if I did, who would keep ya entertained? Who would keep your spirits lifted in the darkest hour? And who would keep up the practical jokes?~
@228  = ~Leave! Hah! You'll have ta force me ta leave ya now!~
@229  = ~Are you sure? At least we could give him a proper burial, y'know. It's not like I like doin' it, but I know I'd like someone to bury me, as well.~
@230  = ~I suppose you are right.~
@231  = ~Imoen, it's just a body. Let it rot.~
@232  = ~No... I am too afraid to stay here for long. The man in black and his cohorts may well return searching for me. Let us move.~
@233  = ~No... no, I can't. But speakin' of bodies... The least we could do is t'give Gorion a proper burial, y'know. It's not like I like doin' it, but I know I'd like someone to bury me, as well.~
@234  = ~Right, then! I'll be with ya all the way!~
@235  = ~But you think first we should bury Gorion? I mean, it's not proper to leave him out like this.~
@236  = ~Right... well, before we start this adventure, shouldn't you bury Gorion, at least what's left of him?~
@237  = ~I suppose you're right. Besides, all great adventures start off after burying someone you cared for.~
@238  = ~Yes, you are right, Imoen. Let us bury Gorion.~
@239  = ~*Suddenly you cannot speak, tears welling in your eyes. You nod your agreement.*~
@240  = ~'Course! It's the perfect name for me, someone who has so many talents!~
@241  = ~Well let's be off then. It just wouldn't do to have this magnificent talent of mine wasted, y'know?~
@242  = ~OKAY!? Perhaps ya don't remember how many times they showed ya the evidence for a prank you never committed, or the times your possessions would go missing only to be found somewhere else in your room, or the time your dress turned transparent in the middle of the town square? I'm sure the guards at Candlekeep could remember that last one. Prolly even some of them crusty ole scholars, as well. That took lots of planning, strategy and finesse...~
@243  = ~*giggling* Just thinking of that...~
@244  = ~*blushing* I-I don't know what you're talking about. It must have been someone else...~
@245  = ~*fuming red-angry* THAT WAS YOU!? COME HERE, BEFORE YOU REGRET IT.~
@246  = ~So, you pulled a few on me when we were young. Big stinking deal. We are grown-ups now, Imoen, and we have to commit *real* deeds to call ourselves Magnificent.~
@247  = ~And what about that time when all the forks in Mr. Winthrop's inn went missing, and everyone thought it was your fault? And that favorite book of yours, which you could not open no matter how you tried? Or the carpet that rolled itself up every time you tried to hit it with your beater? Ha! I got you a couple of times, too!~
@248  = ~OKAY!? Perhaps ya don't remember how many times they showed ya the evidence for a prank you never committed, or the times your possessions would go missing only to be found somewhere else in your room, or the time you dropped your trousers in the middle of the town square? I'm sure almost everyone remembers that. The guards got a good laugh, as did many of those... er... younger-than-one-hundred-years-old-last-supper girls! Even that one you sorta had a crush on... um... what's her name? Ah, doesn't matter.~
@249  = ~*glare* OKAY!? Listen, I know you were always trying to best me, y'know, but you know why you were always the one blamed, and never me? Why you were the one stuck doing all those extra chores, and not me? Well, do ya?~
@250  = ~I did kind of wonder.~
@251  = ~Doesn't matter anymore. 'Sides now we're out here, and there's no one else to go to...~
@252  = ~It's not exactly true, Imoen. What about that time when all the forks in Mr. Winthrop's inn went missing, and everyone thought it was your fault? And that favorite book of yours, which you could not open no matter how you tried? Or the carpet that rolled itself up every time you tried to hit it with your beater? Ha! I got you a couple of times too! But... we're not in Candlekeep anymore, Imoen. There's no one else here to go to... so let us not waste our time with silly contests.~
@253  = ~*rolls eyes* Whatever...~
@254  = ~You... you poor soul... I'm sorry... but I think we should bury Gorion, <CHARNAME>.~
@255  = ~Heh. Well, say what you want. I am Imoen the Magnificent.~
@256  = ~*sweatdrop* Um, well, I gotta go... somewhere. See ya!~
@257  = ~*panting* 'Kay, you... win... for... now... But... see...now... you... don't... so... depressed... You... should... be... thanking... me...~
@258  = ~Well, you can keep on wonderin', cause Imoen the Magnificent never reveals her secrets, unless there's something in it for her. And then she doesn't reveal ALL of her secrets.~
@259  = ~*sweatdrop* Y'know that was all kids' stuff, don'tcha? You wouldn't hold a grudge against me this long?~
@260  = ~No, but don't think you can get away with the stuff you do now so easily.~
@261  = ~Perhaps. We'll see. It depends on how good of a helper you are.~
@262  = ~Uhm... I don't like that term, 'helper'...~
@263  = ~Is that... Is that the letter Gorion was carrying?~
@264  = ~Yes, it was on Gorion's body. He died while protecting me from an attack.~
@265  = ~Right. The *great* mage Gorion! Could not even stand his ground against a couple of ogres and a scare-crow!~
@266  = ~Hey! You were hiding yer butt under a bush while he was fighting all these monsters, weren't ya?~
@267  = ~Don'tcha even know what attacked you?~
@268  = ~I don't, either, but what's done is done. Gorion's spirit won't come back now. I doubt even a High Cleric of Helm could restore him to life. No, we'd best move on now, Imoen.~
@269  = ~Right... well, I wish that we had been able to be at Gorion's funeral, <CHARNAME>.~
@270  = ~I do too, Imoen. But all great adventures start off after losing someone you cared for.~
@271  = ~Yes, you are right, Imoen. Let us say a prayer for Gorion.~
@272  = ~Imoen, it's just a body. Nature and the Gods take all things in time. Let's move on.~
@273  = ~I would wish that, but I am too afraid to stay close to Candlekeep for long. The man in black and his cohorts may well return searching for me. Let's move on.~
@274  = ~Well, let's be off then. It just wouldn't do to have this magnificent talent of yours wasted, right? ~
@275  = ~You... you poor soul... I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@276  = ~C'mon, <CHARNAME>, let's get outta here.~
@277  = ~Wh-who was that?~
@278  = ~Another assassin. Not the same one who killed Gorion, though. If it were, we'd not be standing here right now.~
@279  = ~Another assassin. This is the fourth. I met with two before leaving Candlekeep. One right after leaving Candlekeep. And now this...~
@280  = ~Another assassin. This is the fifth. I met with two before leaving Candlekeep. One right after leaving Candlekeep. And that dwarf in the Red Sheaf...~
@281  = ~Another assassin. This is the fifth. I met with two before leaving Candlekeep. One right after leaving Candlekeep. And that mage on the doorstep of the Friendly Arm Inn...~
@282  = ~Another assassin. This is the sixth. I met with two before leaving Candlekeep. One right after leaving Candlekeep. And that mage on the doorstep of the Friendly Arm Inn... And the dwarf in the 'Red Sheaf'.~
@283  = ~You mean, even inside the walls of Candlekeep you were attacked!? Why didn't ya tell me this before you left?~
@284  = ~I didn't want to worry you and have you tag along with me, like you're doing right now.~
@285  = ~I tried to, but you said you were too busy.~
@286  = ~What do you mean... disturbing?~
@287  = ~Disturbing means disturbing. Let's just get moving...~
@288  = ~Think about it for a second. Whoever it was knew to attack me when we left Candlekeep, as if they were expecting me to flee. Next, whoever it was knew I was heading for the Friendly Arm Inn, and placed an ambush at the inn's doorway. Now this. Gorion made sure no one else knew about the Friendly Arm Inn, and no one here had any idea that we'd be heading to Nashkel. Yet another assassin waits here...~
@289  = ~Heh, yup. I'm stuck to ya like brick and mortar! Well, 'nough chattin' here, let's go get a room so that I can get a nice warm bath.~
@290  = ~Pfft! And you let that stop you! You really need to get a backbone, girl! If you can't stand up to me, how you expect to stand up to your husband?~
@291  = ~Whatever. Let's go.~
@292  = ~Husband? What brought this on?~
@293  = ~Husband, huh? I could say the same thing about you, Imoen.~
@294  = ~Pfft! And you let that stop you! You really need to get a backbone if you expect to get a wife one day, at least if ya don't want her ta keep ya under her thumb!~
@295  = ~Wife, huh? Don't worry, I got plenty of that backbone thing.~
@296  = ~I don't have to worry about that. The person I'd want for a wife is right in front of me.~
@297  = ~Hmph. Alright, but you better explain it to me later.~
@298  = ~I see...~
@299  = ~But that's not all. Why wouldn't that armored man come in person again? Why send lowly assassins, when he was willing to come himself for the first time? What made it different enough to warrant sending imbeciles?~
@300  = ~Alright, standing here does not help any. Let's go.~
@301  = ~It just doesn't make sense, unless... no... dammit! I can't figure it out!~
@302  = ~I-I don't know... Anyways, this is giving me a headache trying to figure this out. I'll let you do all the complex thinking in that regard.~
@303  = ~You know the answer, Imoen. As well as I do. Assassins were waiting for us and were of small caliber, because they are *everywhere*. They chose quantity over quality, betting that someone, somewhere is bound to catch me unawares. So, no matter where we should go...~
@304  = ~Well, lucky you!~
@305  = ~Stop it! You're scaring me!~
@306  = ~Heh, don't worry, I'm pushy enough as it is.~
@307  = ~You can say that again.~
@308  = ~*walk away*~
@309  = ~Maybe when you're fightin' off beasts and whatnot, but not when it comes to women.~
@310  = ~*looks around innocently* Huh? I don't see any other girls close enough... wait, you're not talking 'bout me, are you?!~
@311  = ~Heh, just yanking your chain!~
@312  = ~So, you do not see anyone else? Neither do I...~
@313  = ~Did you say something?~
@314  = ~Uh, yeah. We should go.~
@315  = ~Uh, nope, not a thing.~
@316  = ~Here's for you being a jerk! *kicks <CHARNAME>*~
@317  = ~Ouch! My grievous wounds!~
@318  = ~Then, maybe, you shouldn't be standing around making jokes. Stupid jokes!~
@319  = ~Oh, I see an elven beauty, her hair like spun gold, and her eyes greener than emeralds. The sort all ya males drool after. *kicks <CHARNAME>*~
@320  = ~Then maybe you shouldn't be gawking and making jokes. C'mon, lover-boy. *sticks her tongue out*~
@321  = ~Hmph!~
@322  = ~Candlekeep... never thought I'd be back here again, and especially this early on. Brings back all sorts of memories, doesn't it?~
@323  = ~Yes, it does.~
@324  = ~Yes, like the time you pilfered that pie from Mr. Winthrop and gave it to me half-eaten, just before he arrived to yell at me.~
@325  = ~Yeah, but I'd rather not talk about them.~
@326  = ~No time for reminiscing. We've got work to do.~
@327  = ~Yep. Why, there's Hull! Let's go say hi to him!~
@328  = ~Hey, I was just trying to share. How was I supposed to know Mr. Winthrop was coming by just then? Hmm?~
@329  = ~You always know.~
@330  = ~It doesn't matter. I still got chewed out.~
@331  = ~Oh, let's just drop it. I don't feel like arguing today.~
@332  = ~Still remembering that incident, huh? Can't blame you, though. I'd be remembering it, too.~
@333  = ~Even though it wasn't in Candlekeep proper, it was the last memory I had about it, and it had a horrible outcome.~
@334  = ~Hells. You're really tight-mouthed today. I mean, it's not everyday we come back to our hometown, y'know.~
@335  = ~Who is this Malar that guy was talkin' 'bout?~
@336  = ~Doesn't really matter. I don't really feel like explaining it, either.~
@337  = ~I don't know, either.~
@338  = ~Don't you know anything, Imoen? Malar is one of the gods of this world.~
@339  = ~*roll your eyes and do not reply*~
@340  = ~Yeah, right. I'm sure you don't know, either.~
@341  = ~I do too! Malar is one of the gods.~
@342  = ~Well, yeah. I don't know, either.~
@343  = ~Heh. Well, at least you admit your incompetence, so I won't hold it over you this time.~
@344  = ~Um... yeah... yes, I knew that. I was, um, just testin' ya. That's all.~
@345  = ~Whatever...~
@346  = ~Okay, then, can you tell me what Malar is known as, at least? Hmm? Surely that isn't too hard?~
@347  = ~Listen, Imoen, you may know many practical things, but I remember that you did not study too hard back in Candlekeep. I'll explain about Malar, if you want.~
@348  = ~Hey! What's that supposed to mean? Oh, let's just forget it!~
@349  = ~Um, well, y'know, that um, one guy...~
@350  = ~Yeah. Why don't you just admit you're wrong, and I'll explain about him.~
@351  = ~Thought so.~
@352  = ~*sigh* Yeah. You're right. I was just bluffing. I never could keep my eyes open to read those books or listen to those discussions.~
@353  = ~So do you want me to explain who he is?~
@354  = ~Yeah if it's not too long. I don't want ya to go into some long history y'know, like those old windbags. Yer my friend and all, but I have my limits.~
@355  = ~Okay then, I'll start.~
@356  = ~Never mind, then. I don't think I can do it without boring you.~
@357  = ~Malar is known as the Beastlord, because his powers cover monsters and marauding animals and other related stuff. He doesn't have any major power over humans, but he tried to in the past, when Bane, Bhaal and Myrkul went to get power from the former ruler over the End of Everything, Jergal.~
@358  = ~Of course, they didn't want that, so they held another contest while he went to get preparations for the original. You can say he wasn't too pleased with that result.~
@359  = ~Wow. I bet.~
@360  = ~Thanks. None of those crusty old fossils were able to explain it quite so easily as you did.~
@361  = ~Malar is known as the Beastlord, because he is a patron of hunters, marauding beasts, monsters and evil lycanthropes. Also, he controls bloodlust and stalking, which are all closely related in some manner to beast-like behaviour. He is an evil deity, and considered only a minor power among the deities of Faerun. Apart from those who follow him, he doesn't have any major power over humans.~
@362  = ~One of the more famous incidents he was involved with is known today as 'The History of the Dead Three.' Malar was coming to visit Jergal, the Lord of the End of Everything and the first god of death, strife and the dead.~
@363  = ~Anyway, Malar had come at a time when those who would be known as The Dead Three - Myrkul, Bhaal and Bane - were vying for Jergal's power, since he'd become weary of the job. They were to split the power amongst them. Obviously, Malar wanted in on the action. The Dead Three rolled skulls across the Grey Waste, and Malar went to find another skull for himself.~
@364  = ~Obviously, none of them wanted to share power with him. So while he was gone, they came up with a new game of knucklebones, and when Malar returned with a skull, their game was over. Malar went away furious that he'd come away with nothing, but he couldn't do anything.~
@365  = ~Anyway, that's just one incident among many, but it's good enough for now as I see you're falling asleep.~
@366  = ~*yawn* Yeah. That was kinda long and boring. Well, at least, you stopped before I fell asleep, so yer not quite as bad as those teachers, but still...~
@367  = ~Well, why are we standin' about? Let's just... dig. Maybe one day we can return and add a small gravestone or somethin'...~
@368  = ~He was a good man. Now both his spirit can rest and his body can return to nature peacefully. But by Silvanus, I swear his death will not go unpunished!~
@369  = ~I k-knew him well. He will be sorely missed.~
@370  = ~'Tis a sad thing we did this day, sir. Perhaps I er... can spin a tale of his uhm... final battle into a fitting poem, one that will er... hopefully be remembered for tomorrow and beyond.~
@371  = ~I did not know Gorion, but from what <CHARNAME> sayeth of him, he was a great man.~
@372  = ~Boo says Gorion seems like he was very smart and brave. Minsc thinks Boo is right! Minsc would have liked to know him.~
@373  = ~Not a day goes by without our witnessing the burial of another poor soul destroyed by adventuring. *sighs* I foresee that the hour of our own funeral draws near.~
@374  = ~A shame. He would have made a fine Dwarf-friend.~
@375  = ~That be all you be buryin' him? C'mon, man! 'Tain't a proper burial till he be at least ten feet under! Remind me ta never be buried by ya upper wurlders.~
@376  = ~Looks like the old man gets his final rest now. But why would not they let me take a finger or toe for a... memento?~
@377  = ~Never und'stand ya fancy dancy rit'als. The dead be gun, an ain't not'in left in 'em corpse worth a lickin fer any but em wiz'ns ta use.~
@378  = ~I don't want to have to bury someone ever again. Don't you go and die on me now, <CHARNAME>. I-I don't think I could handle it if I had to bury you, as well.~
@379  = ~Don't worry, Imoen, I won't. Let's go now, and let Gorion rest in peace.~
@380  = ~As long as you promise I won't have to bury you, either.~
@381  = ~Another one!? I knew she was after you once she attacked, but this... this is just too much for me. I mean, I don't like this, not at all. First you get attacked in front of Candlekeep by some blazing maniac out for your blood, and Gorion dies. Then 'gain outside the Friendly Arm Inn, even before we met up with Jaheira and Khalid! Now here, as well! You got attacked and almost died on the doorstep of yet another inn! This is just too much!~
@382  = ~H-had we known an assassin awaited you outside the inn we would have fought them as well, r-right, Jaheira?~
@383  = ~Of course. Else we would have met you at the gate, but we cannot change the past. At least we were here with you this time.~
@384  = ~Yes, I know it's difficult, and yes, I'm grateful for your help. As long as we stick together, no assassins will be able to defeat us...~
@385  = ~This is disturbing. They knew I would be coming here... most disturbing, indeed.~
@386  = ~Yeah! That's right! We're an unstoppable team!~
@387  = ~Yup! Together with myself as the main support, and Auntie Jaheira and Uncle Khalid, villains don't stand a chance.~
@388  = ~Please, Imoen, you can call me Jaheira. No need to use 'aunt' in front of my name.~
@389  = ~Okies, Auntie Jaheira.~
@390  = ~C'mon, quit standin' there, like you're waiting for another assassin to come get you!~
@391  = ~Who did not see this one coming from a mile away? Now the boys'll be bantering for days... yup!~
@392  = ~Ah, you are here, too? Well, you were the quiet one of the pair, you were...~
@393  = ~Ah, I'm done with you.~
@394  = ~This way!~
@395  = ~Thank you! I will!~
@396  = ~Er... goodbye!~
@1001 = ~Eh? Never mind! Must go! Much to do!~
@1002 = ~Eh? Never mind. I've a score to settle with a callous world.~
@1003 = ~Just keep your heads down and your weapons handy.~
@1004 = ~Heh. But we're all a little older.~
@1005 = ~I don't want none of your gold, you hear?~
@1006 = ~Aiyee!~
@1007 = ~Gotta go!~
@1008 = ~Shut up!~
@1009 = ~Flee, I tell you!~
@1010 = ~Shoo!~
@1011 = ~You'll pay!~
@1012 = ~You will see. Farewell.~
@1013 = ~Thank you for your most generous donation.~
@1014 = ~Thank ye kindly!~
@1015 = ~Farewell...~
@1016 = ~Who, me?~
@402  = ~Oh, hush. I can see that <PRO_HESHE> knows what <PRO_HESHE> is doing.~
@403  = ~Ohhh...~
@404  = ~Feel the power!~
@405  = ~This way, if you please.~
@406  = ~Nonsense!~
@407  = ~Rrrrrrrrend them!~
@408  = ~Flee, I tell you!~
@409  = ~Thank you!~
@410  = ~Bastards.~
@413  = ~You will see. Farewell.~
