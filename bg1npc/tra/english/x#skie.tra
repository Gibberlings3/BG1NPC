@0    = ~*sighs*~
@1    = ~Skie? Are you alright?~
@2    = ~Oh, what is it now? ~
@3    = ~Bloody Hells, are you talking again?!~
@4    = ~I was just thinking. Reflecting on the life of an adventurer...~
@5    = ~Anything I can help you with?~
@6    = ~Is this really necessary? ~
@7    = ~Well, one needn't be rude. I just wanted to ask you a simple question!~
@8    = ~I am sorry. I thought you broke your nail again... You have my ear.~
@9    = ~And this is exactly why I was rude. I have neither the time, nor the desire to chat with you.~
@10   = ~If you're going to be like that, I don't want to talk to you at all!~
@11   = ~I'd very much like to see the world. I'd like to travel the road with Eldoth by my side, battling enemies and creating legends together. But I... just have this feeling... you know...~
@12   = ~I do not know how you feel, Skie. If you want my advice, you will have to explain it to me.~
@13   = ~Is this conversation going anywhere? Today?~
@14   = ~Look, I really don't have time for this. Why don't you go pester someone else?~
@15   = ~I'm *trying* to get to the point. I really want to see everything. I want to travel to Amn, to Tethyr, to Cormyr, to... I do not know... everywhere! I want to see Dragons, and Beholders, and even Drow...~
@16   = ~<CHARNAME>?~
@17   = ~Oh, I'm sure you'll see all those things, Skie, and more.~
@18   = ~If your chatter attracts even more monsters, you certainly won't get very far. ~
@19   = ~Skie, if I learned one thing travelling, it is that troubles follow me... So stick with me, and you will likely see every monster there is on Faerun. Though I cannot figure why you would want to.~
@20   = ~No, <CHARNAME>... I just have this feeling that I will not. You'll see it, all of these things and far away lands. And others too maybe, but not me. Oh, forget I said anything! It was just a silly thought, nothing more. Let's get back on the road. ~
@21   = ~How dare you gossip about me, rivvil! Do not think I cannot hear you...~
@22   = ~<CHARNAME>? Would you mind, if I talked with you for a moment? Others have told me that you've recently lost your father.~
@23   = ~Yes, Skie, I lost my father only a few weeks ago in a battle with a merciless foe. His name was Gorion. I miss him dearly.~
@24   = ~Thus, we have established that you have heard of my father's death. What of it?~
@25   = ~I don't want to talk about it. Leave me alone, Skie.~
@26   = ~It's hard, isn't it? Losing someone you have depended on for so long.~
@27   = ~Yes, it is. Gorion was my father, Skie. But more than that, he was a friend, a mentor. He has given me so much.~
@28   = ~Gorion, he is my past. I loved him dearly, but... I was forced to move on.~
@29   = ~Bah, Gorion was a feeble old man. I owe him nothing!~
@30   = ~I understand... your abrasiveness. But... we have gone through the same thing, I think. When I was born, my mother had always taken care of me. My father is one of the four Grand Dukes, and was always busy. My brother was already fifteen years old when I was born, and in training. I never really knew him. But my mother, she was always there. When I was little, and ventured a little too far into the gardens, she was always there to clean my scraped knees. She wanted me to be a proper lady, but still strong enough to lead my own life. I learned to read, write... She hired only the best of tutors for me. I learned to play the piano, the high harp, and my mother made sure I was trained in the dance. She was always there, my only friend... I was devastated when she died. It was all... so sudden, so unexpected. But sometimes I can feel her, still looking out for me... wherever she is now.~
@31   = ~I'm sorry for your loss, Skie. It must have been hard on you. Believe me, I know.~
@32   = ~I'm sorry for your loss, Skie, but you shouldn't dwell on it so. Your mother is gone, and you must go on with your life.~
@33   = ~Are you still talking to me? Thank you for wasting my precious time! Get back in line, you teary-eyed milksop. ~
@34   = ~But... I really would like to talk to you about your father... I think, we have gone through the same thing, <CHARNAME>. When I was born, my mother had always taken care of me. My father is one of the four Grand Dukes, and was always busy. My brother was already fifteen years old when I was born, and in training. I never really knew him. But my mother, she was always there.

@35   = ~Yes, that sounds so... familiar, <CHARNAME>. When I was born, my mother had always taken care of me. My father is one of the four Grand Dukes, and was always busy. My brother was already fifteen years old when I was born, and in training. I never really knew him. But my mother, she was always there.

@36   = ~Moving on, you say. It sounds so callous, doesn't it? As if the past doesn't matter, but it always does in the end. When I was born, my mother had always taken care of me. My father is one of the four Grand Dukes, and was always busy. My brother was already fifteen years old when I was born, and in training. I never really knew him. But my mother, she was always there.

@37   = ~I hope you are not being serious. Does he really deserve your spite? Think on that. You know... when I was born, my mother had always taken care of me. My father is one of the four Grand Dukes, and was always busy. My brother was already fifteen years old when I was born, and in training. I never really knew him. But my mother, she was always there.

@38   = ~I'm sorry for your loss, Skie. It must have been hard on you.~
@39   = ~Thank you for lending me your ear, <CHARNAME>. I have Eldoth and my new friends now, so I don't feel so lonely. I hope that you find at least a little bit of consolation in my friendship, as I do in yours. ~
@40   = ~<CHARNAME>, it's been two years since she died, but it's still hard. I do have Eldoth and my new friends now, so I don't feel so dreadfully alone. I hope that you find at least a little bit of consolation in my friendship, as I do in yours. ~
@41   = ~You... you do not care about anyone, don't you? Not about Gorion, not about your friends who try to console you. At least I have Eldoth. He loves me, he's all I have now. ~
@42   = ~<CHARNAME>? Have I ever told you about how I first met Eldoth?~
@43   = ~No, you haven't. How did you meet him?~
@44   = ~No, and I am not interested.~
@45   = ~Yes, you have told me about it... let us see... twenty-six and a half times. If you continue on now, that will make a full twenty-seven.~
@46   = ~Let's see... I had been sneaking out of the mansion for a couple of months, back then. I missed my mother terribly, and my father and brother rarely had time to spend with me. I had no one to talk to and was going stir-crazy in that big house. So, I started to explore the city at night.~
@47   = ~That must have been dangerous for...~
@48   = ~Why am I even listening to you? ~
@49   = ~Forget it, then. *pouts* ~
@50   = ~Ah, Skie, do not sulk, I *want* to hear it.~
@51   = ~What? Oh, I already did. ~
@52   = ~...a frail and dainty lady such as myself? Not to worry. I traversed through the seediest parts of town unhindered. People were very nice to me in general, especially the men. ~
@53   = ~*snorts* I bet... Sorry, I did not mean to interrupt.~
@54   = ~Well, at least you got the chance to poke about the city.~
@55   = ~They probably didn't know how annoying you can be... at first. I made the same mistake. ~
@56   = ~You... you are a... a lowly brat who does not have any manners. I would not be surprised if the only place you have seen in Candlekeep was the pigsty. I am a fool for taking you for nearly my equal.~
@57   = ~And, one day, I saw Eldoth... and he saw me. It was love at first sight! We talked about everything and everyone! It was like Eldoth and I connected on a spiritual level, you see? My first and only love... ~
@58   = ~I have no doubts that his feelings for you had more to do with your father's coffers than you comely visage or manner...~
@59   = ~Are you... sure about that?~
@60   = ~Zzzzz... Sorry, I must have fallen asleep. ~
@61   = ~How dare you say that! He couldn't have known who I was at the time, or that I even had any money to spend! No, he loves me for who I am!~
@62   = ~Oh? Of course he knew who you were! First of all, you always wear silks, which is not something the poorer folk can afford. Second, your hair and make-up are in a perfect state. Third, you have your family's sigil stitched on every tunic you own.~
@63   = ~Who am I to destroy illusions? Of course, Skie, there was no way he could have known... He loves you, not your father's wealth and title. Otherwise he would have married you right away.~
@64   = ~Oh, Skie I can bear only that much of your incredible stupidity per day! Gods be good, woman, you have your family's sigil stitched on every tunic you own! And the fistula that fastens your cloak is wrought in a shape of a silver shield. And...~
@65   = ~What do you mean?~
@66   = ~Eldoth doesn't strike me as the most loving individual...or honest.~
@67   = ~Don't be foolish. There's only one thing Eldoth is interested in: your father's money. ~
@68   = ~Leave me alone! It's true love, it really is!~
@69   = ~That's what everybody says. *sighs* But that does not matter. He loves me, I know that. Others... just can't understand, I suppose. Thanks for lending me your ear, though.~
@70   = ~Eldoth? Shall we curl up by the fire this evening? It's been long since we had some time alone.~
@71   = ~*sighs* Indeed, my beloved.~
@72   = ~Perhaps we can again share a kiss? It has been long since I felt your lips on mine.~
@73   = ~If it is a kiss you long for, perhaps it would be time to... further our relationship? There is nothing to keep us from celebrating our love. We are free, away from your family's prying eyes and out of your father's reach.~
@74   = ~Eldoth, no! I've told you before, not until we are married!~
@75   = ~Married? *coughs*. I am afraid that the impossible stubbornness of your father prohibits us the bliss of a permanent union. I would never dare to rob you of your father's blessing, even if he treats me with unsightly prejudice and cruelty. But, Skie, my dear, your heart should know that we will be married one day. And since it is the case, why should we wait? Our love...~
@76   = ~No, Eldoth, I'm sorry, but... I can't.~
@77   = ~HAH! The jalil has rejected you, male. Obviously you are a weak and impotent specimen of manhood.~
@78   = ~'No' means 'No', Eldoth. And that's a sign for you to back off.~
@79   = ~Hey, hitting the sack with a slug like you isn't exactly a reward, you know?~
@80   = ~Don't feel bad, Eldoth. In nature, a female often rejects an inferior male. And you are about as inferior a male as they come.~
@81   = ~Thou art an uncouth lout, Eldoth. Withdraw thyself from the maiden at once!~
@82   = ~Ajantis? Why are you walking so close to me, may I ask?~
@83   = ~For your protection, dear Lady. A delicate flower such as yourself is in constant danger from the ignoble knaves that travel the roads of these lands. It is horrible to think upon what the most uncouth of men would inflict on a fair lady such as thee.~
@84   = ~I can take care of myself, Ajantis. I know how to handle a bow and a dagger and I do hit our enemies... usually... sometimes... often enough... Point is, I'm an independent woman with enough wits to survive the road on my own.~
@85   = ~Indeed... I wouldn't dare say otherwise, but sometimes the vile and treacherous walk closer than you think.~
@86   = ~What do you mean? Surely <CHARNAME> can see foes coming from miles away!~
@87   = ~No, no, we must always look for... vipers clutching onto our trust in order to strike us dead.~
@88   = ~Ajantis, you're starting to scare me. What vipers?~
@89   = ~They are those who would pretend to be our allies, only to benefit from our trust. I know they're among us, Skie, closer to *you* than you might realize.~
@90   = ~You're... you're talking about Eldoth, right? Well, stop it! I'm so sick and tired of my friends saying that Eldoth is trouble! I love him, and he loves me. I know he'd never hurt me in any way!~
@91   = ~I pray that you are right, milady. But I shall watch over you and guard you, to make sure he does not defile your innocence.~
@92   = ~Just... leave me and Eldoth alone!~
@93   = ~I cannot make that promise, milady. I am sworn to protect the innocent.~
@94   = ~Alora? How long have you been living in the Baldur's Gate?~
@95   = ~Oh, a while. I really like living here. Buildings are tall, and people tend to look up all the time, so they never notice who has her hands in their pockets. *winks*~
@96   = ~It's kind of depressing here right now, though, the way everyone's afraid of war.~
@97   = ~Bah! War! It's good for nothing, if you ask me. But then, nobody ever takes a halfling seriously... well, 'cept other halflings, of course. Anyway, it's not a good time for pickpockets. People are bound to be wanting us to do more than just spend a few months in a cell if we're caught.~
@98   = ~Oh, I know. We'd both better be extra careful...~
@99   = ~I, at least, have Eldoth to protect me if something happens, but what about you?~
@100  = ~Hey, don't worry about me. I'm cute! Watch me flash my pearlies and, ummm, stuff!~
@101  = ~*chuckles* No doubt.~
@102  = ~Ah! I just adore adventuring! For starters, I get to pick locks, and I have always found it to be a great fun.~
@103  = ~*giggles* Yep, especially when there is somethin' nice in the locked chest.~
@104  = ~Yes! I was so excited when I broke my first lock. It was on a small cupboard in the kitchen, in which the cook kept all the sweet cakes...~
@105  = ~You ate yourself sick to celebrate, didn't you? *giggles*~
@106  = ~Let's just say that I found out why my mother only let me have a single sweet cake at tea-time and leave it at that...~
@107  = ~Have you ever trekked through a dungeon, Alora? Oh, it sounds like so much fun: vast treasure, deadly traps, fierce monsters, certain death around every corner!~
@108  = ~T-that sounds more dangerous than fun, Skie. Just think about those dark corridors, those brown walls dripping with filthy water, the smell of... cookies!!!~
@109  = ~Eh? Cookies?~
@110  = ~*giggles* I just remembered I still had some cookies in my pack! Would you like some?~
@111  = ~Oh, yes, please! *crunch, crunch*. These are delicious. Where did you buy these?~
@112  = ~*giggles* Buy?~
@113  = ~Oh... Where did you swipe these from? They taste very... familiar...~
@114  = ~Errm, well, gotta run...~
@115  = ~Hey, I thought I recognized these cookies! The cook at our mansion makes these!~
@116  = ~Teehee! Tell your cook not to let the cookies cool in the open window again, or someone could sneak in and swipe them!~
@117  = ~Branwen? You're a battle-hardened warrior monster-slashing type, right?~
@118  = ~I am a priestess of Tempus, and I have seen many battles, if that is what you mean.~
@119  = ~I was wondering... Do you have any combat-advice for a beginning adventurer?~
@120  = ~I am always willing to help out a fellow comrade in arms. Take out your weapon.~
@121  = ~Alright. How about this?~
@122  = ~Skie, it's a sword you're holding, not a lollipop. Any cowardly brigand would be able to disarm you in a second!~
@123  = ~Oh, so... What can I do?~
@124  = ~Tighten your grip on your sword. Now, let's do a simple thrust. Put your right foot forward and thrust your sword along the line of your foot.~
@125  = ~Like this? Oh, ooops...~
@126  = ~It is a sword, not a throwing dagger, Skie. Did I not tell you to tighten your grip?~
@127  = ~Sorry, it slipped out of my hand. You... you aren't hurt?~
@128  = ~There wasn't enough force behind the throw for the sword to piece my armor, and that's something else you can work on. Now, I'm going to pretend to attack you to test your defenses.~
@129  = ~AAAAAAHHHHH!!!~
@130  = ~What?! I didn't even raise my weapon yet!~
@131  = ~You... you just looked very scary when you suddenly jumped forward like that!~
@132  = ~Girl, you're as white as a sheet! Who taught you to fight in the first place? Did you have any training at all?~
@133  = ~One of my dance instructors agreed to teach me some fighting-stances after class. I mean, everybody can do it! How hard can it be to fight?~
@134  = ~*sighs* It seems I have my work cut out for me.~
@135  = ~Coran, I heard about your... ahem... misadventure with Brielbara. I was wondering... what do you find so attractive about human women?~
@136  = ~*laughs* Their subtlety, of course, Skie!~
@137  = ~*sighs* Eldoth is right, I am ill mannered... despite all those courtesies my governess tried to teach me...~
@138  = ~No, dear maid, I was merely joking. Human women are... exotic, at least to my eyes.~
@139  = ~Exotic? That's it? That's why?~
@140  = ~They are also more... ahem... rounded than Elven maids. And the most important thing...~
@141  = ~Yes?~
@142  = ~They are so quick to love! Elves live for centuries, they weigh every word and measure every glance, as if they have not enough to spare and cannot afford mistakes. But humans! They dare to love as if they have eternity ahead of them!~
@143  = ~You mean that humans are hotheaded and reckless?~
@144  = ~Daring and passionate...~
@145  = ~Oh, did I misunderstand you, then?~
@146  = ~Of course.~
@147  = ~I was thinking of what you have said about humans being quick to love.~
@148  = ~And you happen to disagree with me?~
@149  = ~You do not know humans very well, Coran. I, for example, loved Eldoth passionately from the very moment I saw him, but I also did a lot of thinking before I decided that he is the man I am willing to tie my destiny with.~
@150  = ~Tell me, fair maid, how long did it take you to come to such a wise decision?~
@151  = ~Why, I had never been taught to think... only how to smile and to tell niceties... But I learned, Coran, I did. I think it took me the whole of two hours!~
@152  = ~I can easily believe that.~
@153  = ~Yes, and it was the best decision in my whole life! And the very first one too!~
@154  = ~I've seen you scowling in my direction again, Dynaheir. What have I done to grieve you this time?~
@155  = ~Thou dost not grieve me, Skie. I am merely wondering if thou art skilled enough to be a part of this fellowship.~
@156  = ~What? You want me gone? But... this isn't still about that accident with the trap, is it? I told you it was an accident!~
@157  = ~'Twas an accident, which could'st have cost lives.~
@158  = ~But it didn't! We all got out of the way before the flame hit us. You're only angry because your robes got singed!~
@159  = ~No, child, 'tis thine overconfidence and thy callous attitude towards lethal danger that angers me. 'Twas thee who misjudged the danger, and 'twas thee who overestimated thine own abilities.~
@160  = ~My 'abilities' may not be perfect, but I'm improving all the time, Dynaheir. Give me a chance! I'm still learning!~
@161  = ~Remember, child, that the most experienced adventurer hast a certain measure of competence, before she acceptest the responsibility of safeguarding the lives of her comrades. While thy fellows might be inclined to offer thee a second chance, traps dost not extend the same courtesy.~
@162  = ~Edwin? Would you mind, if I asked you a question?~
@163  = ~(Ah, Eldoth's trained monkey is capable of speech! What an unpleasant surprise...) Yes, simian, what is it?~
@164  = ~I was just wondering, Edwin. You are of noble birth, like me, and... what's your opinion of adventuring? Is it not grand to sleep under the stars, watching the night sky? Is it not grand to have friends so close as these, whom you can trust with your life?~
@165  = ~(If I have to depend on *her* to defend me, I might as well lay down in front of a moving chariot right now and save the assassins the trouble.) Oh, do not chatter like a Sembian chimp! You'll catch your death of cold if you sleep under the stars. Either that, or you'll wake up half eaten by some creature or other. (Not that I mind it.) There are never enough healing spells, there is never enough privacy, and there are always bugs in the food... whenever there is food.~
@166  = ~Erm, I'd hate to say this, Edwin, but there aren't any chimps in Sembia. Nor any other monkeys. The climate's all wrong there for their kind.~
@167  = ~Good. I was wondering how long it would take you to spot that particular trap I laid out for you. (Yes, she'll swallow that. Now to get rid of her...) Perhaps you wish to discuss planar vortices described in volume twelve of Bigby's Magical Theorum instead of monkeys, Skie?~
@168  = ~Oh! Of course! It is quite fashionable to read Bigby's Magical Theorum lately among the nobles of Baldur's Gate. But, Edwin? Planar vortices are described ad nauseum in volume THIRTEEN of Bigby's Magical Theorem, not part twelve.~
@169  = ~Clearly, I misspoke. (How very annoying when someone so inferior dares to correct my mist... misspoken words!) Away from me, simpleton, there is nothing I wish to discuss with you, as I am not inclined to stoop any lower than I have already had when I graced you with an answer.~
@170  = ~What? What did I say?!~
@171  = ~That's it, Skie. You've made the list! (Oh, yes, she shall pay.)~
@172  = ~Excuse me? What list?~
@173  = ~(One day, one day...)~
@174  = ~*pouts* You're a very silly man, Edwin.~
@175  = ~Edwin, I've been thinking.~
@176  = ~Oh? (Who would suspect that she has it in her?)~
@177  = ~Is everything you wear red? Sure, the robe is obvious, but...~
@178  = ~And she can distinguish one color from another. It seems your tutors were more successful than I gave them credit for. (Apparently, pigs CAN train monkeys to do tricks.)~
@179  = ~Yes, but... red socks? Red shoes? Red moneypouch? Red belt?~
@180  = ~Moronic cretin, red is the Thayvian national color. Doesn't the term RED wizards give you any clues?~
@181  = ~Well, I remember reading how colors represent different emotions, you see? Sometimes, even unconsciously, people dress themselves in a specific color to reflect their mood and mental states.~
@182  = ~What's your point, Skie? (Obviously, it will be monkey-brained.)~
@183  = ~Actually, Edwin, if the books were correct, you are one big walking cry for help.~
@184  = ~What?~
@185  = ~Yes... Desperate for love, attention, affection and passion, which absence you proclaim to the world by wearing those outrageously red clothing.~
@186  = ~These insinuations are ridiculous, and no doubt are a creation of a weak and envious mind... In Thay, every Red Wizard wears red robes.~
@187  = ~Good gods! Yours must be a nation of people with permanent low self-esteem and lack of affection!~
@188  = ~I will have you know that Thayvian sensual arts can only stand to be compared to the seductive practices of the Underdark. However, you have just cheated yourself out of a demonstration. You've mocked me and my glorious homeland long enough, whelp! Away with you!~
@189  = ~But... I was only making conversation, Edwin!~
@190  = ~Well, DON'T! (Fools around me, fools everywhere!)~
@191  = ~Edwin? I uhm... borrowed Mordenkainen's Advanced Divinations from the last merchant. Actually, I took it, because I think he charged us unfairly. Have you ever read it?~
@192  = ~Ah, yes, an excellent read, though divination isn't really my area... It's not that I can't do divinations: such would be foolish to assume, since I am an unparalleled expert of all things magical. I am just... less interested in that aspect of the Art. But the book you mentioned is indeed excellent, if a little pompously written.~
@193  = ~Tell me about it... Oh, and all those footnotes! Going back and forth between them really got on my nerves after a while.~
@194  = ~Indeed, indeed. Though his sentence-structure leaves a bit to be desired too.~
@195  = ~Oh, yes! Remember page 47? *chuckles* One long sentence... When I read that, I could just hear Mordenkainen's deep, monotonous voice rereading what he had just written... I almost fell asleep, and it was my watch!~
@196  = ~I'm surprised that you've chosen this book to amuse yourself. (In fact, I'm surprised you can even read...)~
@197  = ~I always like to be well-read and...~
@198  = ~Why should anyone teach a woman to read? You might as well teach a horse how to dance. Don't worry, Skie. You'll never have to go near a book again.~
@199  = ~Y-yes, Eldoth. I'm sorry... love.~
@200  = ~Eldoth, I'll have you know that more than one female necromancer would turn you into a shambling rotting zombie if she heard you talk like that. (The man's a bigger pig-monkey than even I could suspect.)~
@201  = ~Who asked for your opinion, wizard? Keep out of Skie's affairs, if you know what's good for you.~
@202  = ~*smiles* Fear not, Eldoth. I would not dare to cause a rift betwixt such perfect lovers. (If a seemingly intelligent woman falls for the transparent games of this boorish dullard, she is not as smart as she looks.)~
@203  = ~Eldoth, are you there?~
@204  = ~Yes, my pet. Same place I was, when you left me not five minutes ago.~
@205  = ~I just wanted to say I love you.~
@206  = ~Why, that's very kind of you, but...~
@207  = ~But what are you doing? It looks like you are counting money. There doesn't seem to be much there.~
@208  = ~No. Regrettably, the brief interval between your attentions was sufficient time for me to tally our negotiable funds – twice.~
@209  = ~Oh, dear! I... never thought about adventurers' being poor...~
@210  = ~Don't fret, my dear. Today's famine is always followed by tomorrow's feast – if one has the wit to recognize it and the energy to seize it.~
@211  = ~But... just because we're in love... that doesn't mean we have to be poverty-stricken. I think that Daddy...~
@212  = ~Skie! I am shocked! Unspeakably shocked that you would consider tapping the fantastic wealth of one who kept you caged... imprisoned against your will...~
@213  = ~Nonsense! I'm still his daughter. He owes it to me to see that I have a decent income.~
@214  = ~Then compose yourself, O delicacy, and allow me to consider whether some arrangement might, after all, be made.~
@215  = ~And there we have a prime example of surfacer inferiority. If they have had males running everything for thousands of years, I'm surprised these humans haven't wiped each other out yet.~
@216  = ~If any of my many lovers dared to talk to me in that way, he'd have an appointment with several of my premium arrows.~
@217  = ~Huh, what a creep. He reminds me of a ferret I once knew.~
@218  = ~Spineless fool! Why don't you just throw yourself on his blade and get it over with! It'd be more merciful in the long run.~
@219  = ~I am saddened to have bore witness to this exchange. If I was a leader I would have done *something* about that, <CHARNAME>.~
@220  = ~Eldoth? Do you sometimes think about our future?~
@221  = ~Yes, my sweet Skie? What about our future?~
@222  = ~I mean, do you see us as famous adventurers, travelling the world and surviving by our wits alone? Or maybe as a duo of troubadours, playing our music? Or maybe we'd be celebrated rulers, loved by our subjects?~
@223  = ~That could have been attractive... If you actually had wits, weren't tone-deaf and had any sense of statesmanship... or any sense at all, for that manner.~
@224  = ~Eldoth, please, you know that I play the violin and the piano very well... And there's an image that's been playing through my mind for a while now.~
@225  = ~You're going to tell me whether I want to hear it or not, right? *sighs* Let's get this over with.~
@226  = ~What do you think our children will look like? I bet that if we had a girl, she'd have my brown long hair and your piercing eyes.~
@227  = ~I'm going to stand over there now. Come back and talk to me when you've removed your head from the clouds. Hmm, on second thought, don't talk to me at all.~
@228  = ~Eldoth, wait! Eldoth! *pouts*~
@229  = ~Ermm, Faldorn. Errm, well, erm, how do I put this nicely?~
@230  = ~What is it, townling?~
@231  = ~Oh, the Nine Hells! I'll just say it. Faldorn, you smell.~
@232  = ~Ah, so that is what it is about, city-girl. The dirt is on my skin, the smell of nature is on me, and that's how it should be.~
@233  = ~You smell like humus, Faldorn, no offence.~
@234  = ~And a good earthly aroma it is. Excuse me for not choosing to pollute myself with perfumes and soaps.~
@235  = ~Never mind the soap and perfume! You don't even use water! Why don't you clean up at least a little, and maybe some of us will dare to walk downwind of you?~
@236  = ~When was the last time we have encountered a stream or a lake and had time to bathe? I am not for soaking in one of those unsightly tubs in the inns you seem to be so fond of. And that bubbly stuff you dump into it by the gallon! *shivers* Your hair stinks of it for days every time!~
@237  = ~But, Faldorn...~
@238  = ~I am not surprised that skunks largely prefer my bedroll to yours. They probably develop inferiority complex every time they approach you. But, I can convince one to tough it out and bed with you for a night. Then you will appreciate the smell of nature.~
@239  = ~What?!?~
@240  = ~Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow... One can never be sure when a skunk will come calling.~
@241  = ~*gulps*~
@242  = ~I broke a nail.~ [%tutu_var%SKIEE18]
@243  = ~Carrion crawlers eat my heart! Can I even cure this mortal wound?~
@244  = ~Of course it is not a wound, impossible brat, but I feel upset about it, nonetheless. It has been a month now that I was trying to grow them.~
@245  = ~Well, look at the bright side. Maybe you cannot scratch that deep, but the edge is jagged and does more damage.~
@246  = ~Faldorn, I just wanted to have beautiful nails... But with this exciting adventuring lifestyle, I am afraid it is something I must give up. I wonder if it is possible at all to be a great adventurer and have nice, long...~
@247  = ~Yeah. If one is a half-orc. They have terrific claws.~
@248  = ~Garrick? Yes?~
@249  = ~Wha-wha-what, ME?!~
@250  = ~Erm, sorry to startle you, but you were looking in my direction and I thought you wanted to ask me a question.~
@251  = ~Y-you saw that? Errm, I mean, no, no, I'm fine, fair Skie... I mean, friend Skie.~
@252  = ~Are you sure you're fine? Your face is turning red! I hope you're not coming down with something! It's been raining a lot, after all.~
@253  = ~No, no, I'm fine, more than fine...~
@254  = ~Okay, but we could ask <CHARNAME> if we can visit a temple, if you start feeling worse. When you're on the road, you have to know how to take care of yourself, after all. Just look at my new Yeti-skin boots; all polished and ready for everything. You can drag these through the mud, and they'll still look pretty. And they say I'm not ready for a life on the road! Just look at my lovely silk traveler's tunic and tell me I'm not well equipped for adventure!~
@255  = ~I can't... take my eyes away.~
@256  = ~Garrick? I loved the poem you've read when we were around the campfire last night. Have you written any more?~
@257  = ~Well, no more poems about bunnies, I'm afraid. *whispers* She liked it! She actually liked it! Oooh, Garrick, keep it steady, don't faint, don't faint!~
@258  = ~I like your poetry, Garrick. Eldoth's work is more... grimmer and darker. All so fatalistic and angsty, so it's nice to hear some happy endings and cheerful songs.~
@259  = ~I have one in the works. *whispers* Keep it steady, Garrick! Keep your palms from sweating, she'll notice!. *scrapes throat* Where is... I had it a moment ago and... Ah, here it is! ~
@260  = ~Ahum,
Aspied from afar,
and yet so near,
The sweet flower blooms,
Does my song reach her ear?
Or is my love destined for glooms?~
@261  = ~'Glooms'?~
@262  = ~Yes, um, it needs some work.~
@263  = ~No, it's lovely the way it is. Thank you for sharing it with me.~
@264  = ~My pleasure... Eldoth, does he treat you with respect?.~
@265  = ~He loves me, I love him. Is there need for anything more?~
@266  = ~You deserve better than him. Someone who doesn't treat you like a doormat.~
@267  = ~I... I don't want to talk about this. Thanks for the poem, Garrick, we'll... we'll talk later.~
@268  = ~Look at all those beautiful flowers! Our mansion's gardens are nothing compared to this spectacle. ~
@269  = ~Look at that flower. The beautiful red one that rises about the others in that flowerbed.~
@270  = ~Good eye, Garrick. That's a red rhodelia, a rare find in this climate.~
@271  = ~Allow me, sweet Skie.~
@272  = ~Garrick, what are you doing?~
@273  = ~Giving a fair flower to the fairest flower of them all, Skie..~
@274  = ~Oh, Garrick. *blushes slightly* Don't be silly.~
@275  = ~Sweet Skie, I see your face in my dreams every night. I think of you every waking moment of the day. You inspire my poems, dance through my tales and sing through my aching soul. I pine away whenever you glance in my direction, dear Skie. I... dare I say it, I am deeply in love with you.~
@276  = ~Garrick, I... *blushes deeply*. I mean, you... you're a sweet man, but...~
@277  = ~... my heart already belongs to another, Garrick. I'm very sorry, but I do love Eldoth very much. Perhaps, if I wouldn't have been with him, things could have been different.~
@278  = ~I... understand, Skie. But, I won't stop hoping that, one day... perhaps... the two of us...~
@279  = ~... it is... too soon. I still can't believe Eldoth is gone, and I will never see him again. I... it's just... too soon. But you are sweet, Garrick. Perhaps, in time...~
@280  = ~I am here for you anyway, sweet Skie. I could offer you a shoulder to cry on, at least, or maybe my songs will soothe you in your times of sorrow. Perhaps, in time...~
@281  = ~... my heart already belongs to another, Garrick. I'm very sorry, but I do love Eldoth very much, and I don't want to betray everything he's done for me by courting another man behind his back. Perhaps, if I wouldn't have been with him, things could have been different.~
@282  = ~Imoen, I understand you've only entered our exciting life of adventure recently, just like I did. So, what was your life like, before you left it behind to find excitement?~
@283  = ~It wasn't too bad. Playing pranks on those stuffy old monks and watchers was fun when I was little, but I wanted to see the world. Travel the good road, ya know? I do kinda miss it sometimes, though. So what about you, Skie? Do you miss your old life?~
@284  = ~What's to miss? I mean, I did have a good life, but it's as much as a prison if anything else. I mean, how many state dinners can you have? How many clothes can you have in your wardrobe? How many times can you bathe in donkey-milk before you notice the tedium? How many jewels can one have before you notice the futility of it all, if you are not free to truly experience?~
@285  = ~Wow...~
@286  = ~I mean, we had a luxurious carriage in which we rode through the streets of Baldur's Gate to the ducal palace and the upscale shops. It would have been much more exciting to actually walk there and talk to people, you know?~
@287  = ~I mean, I might have lived in one of the largest estates on the Sword Coast with a whole division of servants, but in the end, it's four walls keeping you inside, stifling your gentle spirit.~
@288  = ~Imoen? Are you alright?~
@289  = ~Wow... Tell me about those donkey-milk baths again? What are they like?~
@290  = ~Have you heard a word I said?~
@291  = ~Yeah, yeah, yeah, just tell me about the milk-baths already!~
@292  = ~Well, if that's what you want to hear... Oh, I'll tell you at the campfire tonight. <CHARNAME> is looking funny at us.~
@293  = ~Imoen? Don't you feel this kind of travelling can have some inconveniences? I've not bathed since this morning and I'm feeling a bit grimy.~
@294  = ~Well, with all the dungeon-trekking, monster-stomping, walking around, and quest-searching we're bound to get a bit mucky. It's no biggie. We can just dive in a river when we get the chance.~
@295  = ~But... I can't shake the feeling of the filth clinging on to me.~
@296  = ~This is adventuring, Skie. You shouldn't be afraid to get your hands a little dirty. Here, take this...~
@297  = ~Imoen! You're holding a piece of mud!~
@298  = ~Sure, it's your training. Catch!~
@299  = ~Eek! There's mud-splats all over my clean clothes!~
@300  = ~Hey, but you caught the mud ball, didn't you? I'm seeing some definite improvement here~
@301  = ~It's... not so bad, I suppose and... aw, I broke a nail!~
@302  = ~Well, it's a start, at least.~
@303  = ~So, Imoen, do you have any pass-times you enjoy?~
@304  = ~You mean, besides picking pockets, disarming traps, trying not to get killed and trekking all over, above and under the Sword Coast?~
@305  = ~Oh, yes, besides all these minor hobbies.~
@306  = ~No, not really. Though, I'd like to be able to dance like you did that time at the campfire the other day.~
@307  = ~Ermmm, that dance was meant for Eldoth, Imoen.~
@308  = ~Skie... *sighs* Eldoth was paying more attention to his plate than he did to you.~
@309  = ~I... I'll just have to try harder next time, that's all. Now, how about I teach you dancing?~
@310  = ~That would be great!~
@311  = ~Sure, well... Ah, we'll use this fence over here. Do as I do... First, lay your leg on the fence like so... yes, you're doing fine. Now, raise your arms, slowly arch your back forward and bend towards your toes.~
@312  = ~I can do that and... ooops!~
@313  = ~Imoen? What was that sound?~
@314  = ~I, ermm, I... think I just tore my pants!~
@315  = ~Oh, sweet Sune! *giggles*.~
@316  = ~Yeah, sure, laugh it up! Now, where did I put that sewing kit?~
@317  = ~It's just a setback, Imoen.~
@318  = ~*giggles* Maybe I'll just leave the dancing to you...~
@319  = ~*sighs* I'm a bit peckish. Could we take a short break to have something to eat?~
@320  = ~Certainly, young lady. It has been a while since we last ate. Perhaps we should take out our rations and see if there's something to spare.~
@321  = ~Great! I'll have two warm-roasted baguettes with some smoked salmon, some slices of tomato, a little garlic butter and some hard-boiled quail's eggs to go with that.~
@322  = ~Skie... I do not think you are quite grasping the concept of 'rations'.~
@323  = ~Oh, poo. If it's really that much trouble, I'd be willing to forgo on the garlic butter.~
@324  = ~*sighs* Silvanus, save me... It's a little more complicated than that, Skie. I do have some slices of toast left from yesterday's breakfast. They're a little stale, though, but edible.~
@325  = ~Emmm, as long as the salmon is fresh, it's fine, I suppose.~
@326  = ~Sorry, no salmon. Salmon spoils too quickly, but I do have some salted kippers lefts. You're welcome to those, if you like.~
@327  = ~I'll... pass, thank you. Is there any tomato?~
@328  = ~Perhaps you'd like some onion rings?~
@329  = ~So there won't be any quail's eggs either?~
@330  = ~You can have this stale pickle, if you like.~
@331  = ~*sighs* Forget I asked for anything. Let's just move on. Oh, and help remind me to pick up a huge picnic-basket filled with delicious delicacies the next time we visit an inn.~
@332  = ~Yes... I'm sure we'll all benefit, if one of our number is too busy lugging around a heavy basket instead of defending the party from brigand attacks.~
@333  = ~*wheeze* It... it hurts...~
@334  = ~I am here, foolish child. Let me see those wounds.~
@335  = ~Did... *cough* did you see me, Jaheira? Did... did you see me stab that...~
@336  = ~I mostly saw you trying to get yourself killed, now hold still, so I can treat you!~
@337  = ~I... *gasps* This is... what I read about. The battle... The blood is rushing through my veins.~
@338  = ~Your blood is mostly gushing over my hands right now. So, do as I say, and hold STILL!!~
@339  = ~I didn't think adventure would hurt this much... *wheeze*~
@340  = ~Promise me to think back upon this day ten years from now, Skie. If you haven't crossed the veil by then...~
@341  = ~Thank you for helping me fix dinner for our friends the other night. I'm afraid my cooking skills leave a bit to be desired.~
@342  = ~D-don't worry about it, Skie. I was happy to help. Eldoth was r-rather hard on you, wasn't he?~
@343  = ~He's... only harsh because he wants me to learn quicker. Besides, I know he means well. He only wants what's best for me, after all. I just have to adjust, that's all.~
@344  = ~He had no r-right to yell at you like that, Skie. You had d-done no great wrong.~
@345  = ~But... he really means well. I... I just have to try harder for him.~
@346  = ~S-skie, you are an intelligent, witty and beautiful young lady. You d-deserve to be treated better than Eldoth usually chooses to.~
@347  = ~I love Eldoth, Khalid. Not someone else... And that is my final word on the matter.~
@348  = ~I d-don't seek to offend you, Skie. But I hope you will s-see Eldoth's behavior for what it is, before it is too late.~
@349  = ~Minsc, may I ask you something?~
@350  = ~Why, certainly! What can Minsc do to help?~
@351  = ~I was wondering if that tattoo on your face...did it hurt? Was it painful?~
@352  = ~Any pain Minsc felt, is tiny compared to the fear it places in the hearts of the enemy! Evil doers turn and flee at the sight of the painted Minsc and the enraged Boo! And let me tell you: an enraged giant miniature space hamster is not a pretty thing! It makes even the fearsome Minsc tremble!~
@353  = ~Oh... so it's an image thing. I understand.~
@354  = ~All I want is a Kara-Tur symbol. I'm not too concerned about "striking fear into the hearts of the enemy".~
@355  = ~Eh? Why would you want to cut open your pretty face if not to warn villain's butts about the kicking that would swiftly follow?~
@356  = ~Style, of course!~
@357  = ~Style? Oh! Minsc has style! Just ask Boo, he will tell you what a stylish hero Minsc is!~
@358  = ~Squeak!~
@359  = ~Ahhh! Minsc! Keep that vermin away from me! It might be ridden with all kinds of diseases!~
@360  = ~Diseases? You hurt Boo with your cruel tone! See how he blushes so. Though even Boo must admit that he has become rather smelly of late.~
@361  = ~Oh... er... I'm sorry, Minsc. Here, take some of my washing herbs. Maybe you can give Boo a nice bath?~
@362  = ~Ah, Skie, you are a true friend to fuzzy warriors everywhere!~
@363  = ~Now Minsc and Boo shall stand tall above villainy, heroic and hy-~
@364  = ~*squeak!*~
@365  = ~Hygenic!~
@366  = ~What a lovely brooch, my dear.~
@367  = ~Thank you, darling. I hoped that someone would notice it. Preferably a dashing man.~
@368  = ~Do you know, I was *very* tempted by one almost exactly like that... but the shopkeeper wanted *far* too much for it.~
@369  = ~This might be *that* one. The shopkeeper gave me a... a discount.~
@370  = ~Ooooh, naughty!~
@371  = ~Those are really nice earrings! I don't think I've ever seen any like them before... oh, except in that other place we visited, of course...~
@372  = ~Teehee! We really *shouldn't* go "shopping" after the third glass, should we, dear?~
@373  = ~*sigh*~
@374  = ~Must you whine so loudly? Your mewling is giving me a headache.~
@375  = ~Oh, I'm sorry... It's just that Eldoth said that I'd put on weight lately. But... but I've hardly been touching my food... *sigh* It's not fair!~
@376  = ~Why would you care what that *man* thinks? His words are nothing.~
@377  = ~You... you don't understand! I've got to look *just* right! If I don't, Eldoth might find another girl, and... and not want to be with me anymore. He might not love me...~
@378  = ~Pathetic little girl! Love is nothing but a foolish notion, dreamt up by idiots like yourself, who are yearning to feel "safe" and be "comforted" in the hope that it would make their miserable existence that little bit more bearable. It makes me *sick*.~
@379  = ~Wha... What do you know? Nothing! Eldoth loves me, he... he said so!~
@380  = ~Ha! That worm is full of nothing but half-truths and empty promises. You need to open your eyes, girl, open your eyes to the one that "promises" that he "loves" you, and see him for the liar that he is.~
@381  = ~*sobs* You jus... just leave me alone, Shar! You know nothing... nothing!~
@382  = ~Hey, a funny old gnome! Could you juggle some turnips for me?~
@383  = ~Come again? You insult my superior intellect by asking me to perform such a mundane circus-trick.~
@384  = ~'Twas no insult, sir Gnome. I simply wanted to...~
@385  = ~I have the brain power unrivaled by anyone's on Faerun for thousands of years!~
@386  = ~But I only wanted to...~
@387  = ~This mind contains the wisdom of over ten thousand tomes filled with knowledge, which I have slaved above for my entire natural life...~
@388  = ~But, Quayle, I...~
@389  = ~I have traveled across the planes, visited dozens of worlds, conversed with creatures of wisdom unparalleled...~
@390  = ~Quayle, I only asked you to...~
@391  = ~...and this little chit has the GALL to ask me... ME... to juggle TURNIPS?!~
@392  = ~So, then you're not the gnome wearing the fake red nose and the polka-dotted suit that traveled with the circus which visited Baldur's Gate two years ago?~
@393  = ~Errr, yes... that was me. *sighs* You have a good memory, lass.~
@394  = ~I remember it so well, because it was just before my mother died... we went to the circus together, the last time we ever got to spend time together. I just wanted to... re-live the memory, I suppose...~
@395  = ~I see, well, I... *sighs* Meet me later tonight and make sure nobody sees you sneaking off. I'll juggle some turnips just for you alone..~
@396  = ~Thank you, Quayle. I'd really appreciate that.~
@397  = ~But never tell anyone!~
@398  = ~I won't. Thank you.~
@399  = ~*warily* Why are you staring at me, Tiax?~
@400  = ~Tiax was just thinking that you remind him of a time when he wasn't on the verge of global domination.~
@401  = ~There was a time when you weren't... umm, like you are now? ~
@402  = ~Even Tiax is astonished to think that he once was as insignificant and petty as the rest of these bugs! But yes, it was true. Tiax was a priest of Baervan Wildwanderer, and widely loved and respected by all he met.~
@403  = ~Oh?~
@404  = ~In fact, Tiax was the ruler of the Gnomish priesthood! Tiax dominated Gnomish communities for hundreds of miles around, each paying greater homage to him than the last, with worshippers clamoring at his doorstep by the thousands for just a glimpse of his magnificent nose! ~
@405  = ~Erm...~
@406  = ~Since then, however, Cyric has called Tiax to a greater purpose... and the result is the mighty Tiax of today, on the cusp of world domination! Baervan Wildwanderer simply had to step aside.~
@407  = ~That's... errr... fascinating, Tiax. I thought that Garl Glittergold's followers led the Gnomish priesthood, though.~
@408  = ~Ummm... of course not! Tiax could not be less than the leader of the priesthood, even before his destiny was revealed to him! Any other thought is blasphemy!~
@409  = ~And why do I remind you of yourself back then?~
@410  = ~*eyes seems to clear a little* Tiax lived a life of luxury and seclusion, just like you have. Tiax's father was rich and powerful, just like yours. Tiax doesn't remember that time very well anymore, but Tiax remembers that he was forced into the real world just as harshly and suddenly as you have been. Tiax didn't like it.~
@411  = ~And... and what was the result?~
@412  = ~*eyes grow wild again* The result!? The result is that Tiax is Tiax, lord of all living things and future ruler of the world! What kind of idiot question is that!? ~
@413  = ~Oh. I... I see. Well, all's well that ends well, I suppose...~
@414  = ~Ow! I think I've got a splinter in my foot. ~
@415  = ~Tiax offers his sympathy. No splinter has DARED come near Tiax's feet in many years, but he remembers a time when he got many of them. Tiax had another lackey back in those days, though... though Tiax doesn't remember those days very well anymore...~
@416  = ~Ummmm... Tiax? ~
@417  = ~From what Tiax recalls, he travelled with another gnome for many years. Tiax single-handedly slaughtered all who got in their way, and the other gnome worshipped him as his savior and protector. The other gnome, of course, was weak and cowardly in comparison to Tiax, but Tiax tolerated his presence.~
@418  = ~Tiax?~
@419  = ~Of course, one day, they were attacked by bandits. The other gnome was cowardly and weak, and scurried away for his pitiful life, leaving Tiax alone to fend off hundreds... nay, THOUSANDS!... of the ravenous marauders single-handed. Tiax slew and slew and slew, sending broken bodies flying this way and that as he vented his wrath on his enemies!~
@420  = ~'Twas a bloodletting that captured the imaginations of gods themselves! It was on that day that Cyric descended from the sky, awed by Tiax's might, and declared Tiax to be his immortal champion and future ruler of the world! Tiax's destiny was assured on that day, and Tiax has been Cyric's faithful servant ever since, his most powerful warrior, his harbinger of doo...~
@421  = ~TIAX!!!~
@422  = ~Ehhhh... what?~
@423  = ~It's just a splinter. A very annoying splinter, mind you. Tiax? Could you please take the pincers from my kit and pull it out?~
@424  = ~Ehhh. Right.~
@425  = ~Viconia? I just can't understand why you're being so unreasonable! I mean, we're adventurers in the same group. Aren't we all supposed to be friends?~
@426  = ~Oh, the spineless slug speaks! Why, without asking for permission from the male holding your leash. If I were you, I'd worry about being choked by the chain around my neck. Fortunately... I am not you.~
@427  = ~Are you threatening Skie yet again, drow? I've told you before: she isn't interested in your lies and fancy tales!~
@428  = ~The little elg'caress obviously believes your lies, so why not mine? *winks*~
@429  = ~Take that back! Eldoth would never, ever lie to me!~
@430  = ~That is what I shall have them put on your tombstone when the viper finally strikes.~
@431  = ~Be quiet, wench! Women should be seen, but not heard!~
@432  = ~Oh, dear Eldoth, be assured that you will not hear me, not even if my dagger slices through the soft flesh of your exposed throat. ~
@433  = ~Don't you dare lay a hand on my Eldoth!!!~
@434  = ~Leave it be, Skie. Let's be away from this... this... *female*.~
@435  = ~*chuckles*~
@436  = ~The way you deal with men is so... ungentle, Viconia. Why do you have to offend my poor dear Eldoth so?~
@437  = ~Waela rivvil, you are too consumed by your delusions to see the truth of things. Males are secondary life forms, useful only for the things that females may extract from them. And your Eldoth, your sweet and lovable Eldoth, is scum of the lowest order.~
@438  = ~Ahh! I... uhm... ergh! I wouldn't expect you to understand Eldoth. It seems that most people don't. But I love him, and that's all that matters. Eldoth always tells me that love conquers all, and... and that love's the only thing a girl like me needs. He's right, you know.~
@439  = ~Your head is empty, I am sure of it now. You're a fool to fall for such hollow lies. Have you no drive to assert your authority? To crush the jaluk beneath your heel as-~
@440  = ~You crazy bitch! Be quiet! Come on, Skie, I won't let her hurt you any longer.~
@441  = ~You surface dwellers prove, time and time again, to be the most witless creatures in existence!~
@442  = ~Oh, Eldoth... I have a headache again. You'll make it all better, won't you?~
@443  = ~Yes, yes, you'll feel like a new woman, or some such nonsense. Now don't strain yourself by speaking.~
@444  = ~Xan, will you please stop groaning? You're being very depressing!~
@445  = ~Life is depressing, Skie.~
@446  = ~No, you are depressing. How long do elves live? A thousand years? Do you want to be depressed and down for a millennia long?~
@447  = ~No, no... Perhaps the next battle will end it all, and will send me to the eternal joy of Arvandor, where all elves dwell, who passed away before me.~
@448  = ~No doubt you'll find a way to rain on their joyful parade, too. Come on, Xan, this is adventure! The joy of life, the feeling of being truly free!~
@449  = ~You mean the joy of being eaten alive by a monster of your choice, or being trapped in a dungeon by an evil overlord? And then there's being stomped on by a dragon, being slain by a dwarf, getting your legs chopped off for an orc's supper, getting an arrow through the skull, getting blown up by magic, spun in by a spider, getting eaten by a drow...~
@450  = ~I heard that, Elf!~
@451  = ~Oooo...~
@452  = ~Not so keen on adventure now, Skie?~
@453  = ~Keener than ever! I'll marvel when I first see a dragon... *mutters* and having a wyrm stomp on you might be a nice bonus.~
@454  = ~Say, as you will... But I can feel death's clammy hand on my shoulder. Oddly enough, it's shaped like a dragon's claw.~
