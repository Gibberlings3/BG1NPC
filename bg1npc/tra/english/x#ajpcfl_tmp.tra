His skill and devotion apparently brought him to the attention of the paladin Keldorn, one of the most respected of the order, who decided to take Ajantis under his wing as a squire. Recently Ajantis has asked for the honor of becoming a full-fledged member of the order. To accomplish this he has traveled to the Sword Coast, in order to help curtail the increased humanoid activity in the region.

@336  = ~Get rid of the evil in this group! It is contaminating our presence.~
@337  = ~<CHARNAME>, I cannot agree to the way we treat the people seeking our help. I see you making bad decisions and turning down pleas for help. This is not the way we should behave on our glorious search!~
@338  = ~I hear your words... You sound very determined. I will accept your decision, although it makes my heart bleed.~
@339  = ~By Helm! So let us end our deep personal bond and return to being nothing but fighting comrades. *sighs* I will stay at your side and support you in our current fight.~
