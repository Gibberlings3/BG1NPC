@0    = ~Hail, travelers. That cloaked elf matches the description I was given. Are you Kivan of Shilmista?~
@1    = ~Snowball, here! Swiftclaw, EXCUSE you!
Dread, leave the <RACE> alone!
Babe, stay, you're a good girl... Fang, stop drooling all over this good <LADYLORD>. 
<PRO_HESHE> is not our prey.~
@2    = ~So, apparently you can kill. Very good.~
@3    = ~Are you joining me, Imanel?~
@4    = ~Do I get a reward?~
@5    = ~Yep, that was fun.~
@6    = ~*chuckles* You have done what I have planned you to do. You are of no further use. Be grateful that I allow you to leave with your hides untouched.~
@7    = ~Fair enough.~
@8    = ~Farewell then. When you grow up, mellonamin, you just *might* become an acceptable companion for me. Good hunting.~
@9    = ~Farewell then. Good hunting.~
@10   = ~*laughs* Speaking of rewards, there was a bounty on your head, as well. I think that this money is mine! You are weakened and would not put up much of a fight. By all gods, I like stupid prey!~
@11   = ~You, <PRO_RACE>, you seem to be in charge of this... band. What say you?~
@12   = ~Silversword, you have taken enough of our time with your chatter. Kivan is my friend. I will fight at his side, no matter what. His enemy is my enemy.~
@13   = ~*You* can join *me*, if you wish.~
@14   = ~Oh, you require some company other than those beasts at your feet?~
@15   = ~What's with all these wolves?~
@16   = ~*chuckles* Rubbish sticks together. More spoils then. I repeat my question: does anyone cherish free lifestyle in your midst? Or any lifestyle for that matter?~
@17   = ~You are an ambitious one, aren't you? Prove me that you are worth my calling you a commander. Kill the ranger, let me see you in action.~
@18   = ~How about we just let the ranger off the hook and you'd take his place in line? I like you much more... but I do not want others to say that I draw sword against my companions.~
@19   = ~That goes without saying. To tell you the truth, I am surprised that this whiner lived that long around me.~
@20   = ~That is not the attitude I like in my thralls... and companions, of course. I guess today is the day you die.~
@21   = ~Perfect. Let me settle myself comfortably while you commence with the slaying.~
@22   = ~My wolves are my company. However, I'm involved in all sorts of assignments, and as often as not I require someone walking on two feet and speaking Common. Of course, I will not accept someone totally unknown to me into my service, so I will require you to pass a small test. Here, kill the ranger, let me see you in action.~
@23   = ~Lady, slow down. *I* am not to serve *you*. *You* can join *me*, if you wish though.~
@24   = ~Snowball, attack! Swiftclaw, FORWARD!
Dread, gut them! Babe, be a good girl and KILL! Fang, stop drooling all over this good <LADYLORD> and rip <PRO_HISHER> throat, already!~
@25   = ~<CHARNAME>, goth en gothamin ar' mellon en mellonamin - foe of my foe and friend of my friend - by the first sapling that rose where Shilmista now stands and by the last shadow it will cast before all things will end, I swear to give my blood for you.~
@26   = ~It appears that we are allies in this battle, <CHARNAME>, even if reluctant ones.~
@27   = ~Nothing hurts more than betrayal. You had my friendship, now you wish to have my head? Come; try to take it off my shoulders then.~
@28   = ~I am.~
@29   = ~Short and to the point.~
@30   = ~My name is Imanel Silversword.~
@31   = ~I am in a mood for a pleasant conversation, but Tazok mentioned that it was your wife who did all the talking, not you. *sigh*~
@32   = ~Tazok is a friend of mine, if you failed to understand the subtlety of my hint.~
@33   = ~You have my bow.~
@34   = ~Oh, yes, Tazok would not know what to do with your bow, it being elven made and enchanted for only elves to use. So I have it now. It is a sweet weapon, Kivan.~
@35   = ~I like it.~
@36   = ~Deheriana gave me this bow for our wedding. If there is a drop of honor left in you, you will return it to me, oath-breaker.~
@37   = ~Oath-breaker? I can see that you have some sense of humor. I like it in men.~
@38   = ~At least I hope that's what it is. Or are you indeed one of those pathetic creatures who take the ranger's vows seriously?~
@39   = ~I pity those who foreswore, not those who kept to their word.~
@40   = ~No sense of humor, then?~
@41   = ~How disappointing! Well, let us talk business then, shall we? I have a generous heart, and I am in need of men. The blasted fools I traveled with got themselves killed when you sacked our camp. *shrugs* What do you expect of Na'N'Tel'Quess - barely persons? You are an Elf, at least.~
@42   = ~I am inclined to give you a chance - I will take you under my protective wing and teach you what life is all about, Kivan. ~
@43   = ~I will not ally myself with your cause.~
@44   = ~Oh, do not you understand that your second option is a gravestone with your name on it? That slow, eh?~
@45   = ~I was paid for the task of returning your head to Tazok. I intend to *fulfill my vow*, if you do not give me a reason to spare you.~
@46   = ~Refuse my offer, and there would be no revenge for your pitiful Deheriana. If you take it... I'll help you to backstab Tazok. After all, he would be insisting that I cut that lovely throat of yours with all the brutal stubbornness of his lesser race.~
@47   = ~When the prospect of payback is equal, I ally myself with the cutest side, and you have that advantage over Tazok, Kivan.~
@48   = ~Hmmm... if you wash some.~
@49   = ~Tazok is no more, Silversword.~
@50   = ~Naive as well... Delicious! No, Kivan, Tazok is not dead. Tazok is serving a leader of the Iron Throne, and he brought him back to life.~
@51   = ~There is a lesson for you in that - masters sometimes give treats to the dogs that serve well.~
@52   = ~Oh, not the *same* words again! Do not make a mistake of taking me lightly, mellonamin.~
@53   = ~I dread a day when I call someone like you a friend, but I do not underestimate you. You look like quite an accomplished murderer, Imanel Silversword.~
@54   = ~Then you choose death.~
@55   = ~*sighs* And I was even going to offer you back that bow... after we would have found a better one.~
@56   = ~I cannot go around forever with a bow which has "mela en' coiamin Kivan" inscribed all over it. "My beloved Kivan..." - and that's not the worst of it.~
@57   = ~I wonder, why your little wife did not use parchment to write all this nonsense down and give to you? Ah, I know! She was sure that the bow would never leave your hands...~
@58   = ~How touching.~
@59   = ~Kinslaying is not something I wish to do, Imanel. Allow me to escort you to the Flaming Fist's quarters or to any other authorities you would wish to surrender to. There might be yet a chance for you to redeem yourself.~
@60   = ~Kivan, you are a fool, and you are soon to be a dead fool. Does anyone among you have a brain? Join me, and we shall have loads of gold and fun together.~
@61   = ~The imbecile ranger, of course, will have to be killed....~
