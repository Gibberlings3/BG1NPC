@0    = ~The longer I wander in the insecure world, the more I miss the safety of Evereska. It is only another illusion, I know, but still...~
@1    = ~Yes, I feel the same. I was nearly killed in Candlekeep, and yet, I cannot stop thinking that once I return there, all my troubles will be over.~
@2    = ~You are right. It is an illusion. No place is secure, Xan. I grew up in the library locked away from the world, and even there the assassin found me. Castle walls, the blades of loyal soldiers, the mighty protection spells - all that can be overcome if someone wants to take you down.~
@3    = ~Xan, I am not going to offer you a silk handkerchief, so you could wipe your tears and fears away. In fact, if you will not shut up, I will gladly strangle you with it.~
@4    = ~The world is a dangerous place, but some people still manage to see their hair turning gray... let's hope that we won't die for long time yet, no matter where we are.~
@5    = ~Young <CHARNAME>, nothing ever returns to what it once was. The world develops, and I fear to say that it grows worse and worse.~
@6    = ~That cannot be right! Surely it can only become *better* than now!~
@7    = ~This world is falling apart, true. But perhaps the goal of existence is to improve it. It is quite rewarding to think that thousands of years after our passing peoples much kinder and nobler shall populate Toril, because we made an effort to better ourselves.~
@8    = ~Xan, is there a single thing you are not fearful of?~
@9    = ~You are a wise person for someone so young and adventurous. I would consider you a sensible person, even, if only you tried harder to avoid endangering our lives unnecessarily. Many of those quests you engage us in are but a gate to the afterlife.~
@10   = ~Alas, Xan, there is no such thing as a preventable danger.~
@11   = ~Do not take me for a distraught roamer of the wilds, Xan. Yes, I shoot blindly sometimes, or take a pity on someone who needs help, but I am focused on my main task. I am doing what I can to find the one who sent assassins after me.~
@12   = ~Xan, what I have said for me means that there is no other choice but to stand up and fight! And the more I do it, the more I grow to like it. Living dangerously is a thrill!~
@13   = ~*sighs* I have seen it in my dreams once... only it was not a handkerchief, but wisps of silk, and it was not you, but a giant eunuch from Chult. I was concerned for a while that the dream was prophetic.~
@14   = ~Of course it was! You are a lucky man, Xan, for you know how you are going to die. If I were you, I'd stop worrying for now. The one who is fated to be strangled will survive an orc's mans arrow through the heart, or a gnoll's blade through the liver.~
@15   = ~And I thought I have disturbing dreams!~
@16   = ~Close enough. Now, if you wanna live, SHUT UP!~
@17   = ~And hope, they say, dies last.~
@18   = ~*sighs* You would be surprised...~
@19   = ~Remember the story of Karsus? He wanted to better himself and become a god of magic. Alas, all he achieved was destroying Netheril Empire.~
@20   = ~I live, therefore I fear. I fear, therefore I live.~
@21   = ~Alas, you are right, <CHARNAME>.~
@22   = ~Your efforts are admirable, if vain. He is surely a powerful man, and persistent.~
@23   = ~Your suicide mongery is sickening, <CHARNAME>. Excuse me, while I lament on joining my destiny with a maniac.~
@24   = ~Why must we be cursed with the ability to sleep? Is not reverie enough? Whilst some of my memories are somber, they are not quite as cruel as the imaginary happenings, which occur in dreams.~
@25   = ~You want me mute and deaf, I suppose, as your shouting is surely to destroy my hearing.~
@26   = ~*sighs* Go ahead, ask me why a mage carries a sword around.~
@27   = ~All right. Xan, why does a mage carry a sword around?~
@28   = ~Xan, I know a little about the swords like yours. Moonblades adjust to his or her owner's persona, be it a mage or a warrior.~
@29   = ~I have no desire to ask you about anything. I have had enough of your doomsaying.~
@30   = ~I grew up away from our kin, Xan, but I know our custom. I hail you, the defender of Elvendom and the wielder of the Moonblade.~
@31   = ~Xan, I am not ignorant in the ways of our people. The blood must really run thin in Evereska, if Moonblade chose to bond to *you*! ~
@32   = ~So, you are a mage, huh? With a sword, huh? So what?~
@33   = ~*sighs* I knew that I would have no peace until I explained it to everyone. That, no doubt, will make my throat sore, and a mage with a sore throat is a dead mage...~
@34   = ~Oh, dear. Please, Xan, do rest your voice. I apologize for my untimely curiosity and vulgar insensitivity.~
@35   = ~Why is that?~
@36   = ~Go on, Xan. Tell me about your sword.~
@37   = ~I can never decide if being versed in lore enhances or reduces the chances of our survival, <CHARNAME>. Alas, they are negligible currently, so it makes no difference.~
@38   = ~Doomsaying? So you remain ignorant of the dire peril we are in. May I advise you to put blinders on?~
@39   = ~It is... it is almost reassuring to be recognized my... my <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>.~
@40   = ~The Moonblade chooses heroes worthy to wield it, Xan. You are maybe a walking and talking collection of lamentations, but your heart must be noble and pure. I am honored to have you as my companion.~
@41   = ~I have a theory, Xan. Moonblades are enchanted to kill their owners for major acts of cowardice, malice, brutality and dishonesty. Knowing you, I do not doubt that the blade chose you because it understood that you just do not have guts to do anything that would endanger your life. So, you are a hero against your own will, committing acts of bravery and self-sacrifice, while whining in terror. ~
@42   = ~Trust me, Xan, meeting you is an unforgettable experience.~
@43   = ~You read a book once, then? Young fool, the ways of my kin cannot be learned in the library.~
@44   = ~So I am *not* of *your* kin. I am glad to hear it, Xan. Really glad.~
@45   = ~I am sorry, Xan. I spoke out of line. Only, I have imagined the just and fair noble elven lords... erm... differently.~
@46   = ~So you have the major flaws of *our* people - their arrogance and snobbism. A pity that it is not complimented with their redeeming treats. Bravery, noblesse, refinement - it's just not in you. ~
@47   = ~"So what?", indeed.~
@48   = ~You have just demonstrated the main advantage of the words over the deeds. One can refute what was said on later occasion. On the contrary, the consequences of one's actions are rarely that easily amendable, especially if they resulted in a fatality, as so many actions do nowadays.~
@49   = ~Xan! Your voice!~
@50   = ~Maybe you can tell me about the sword, after all...~
@51   = ~Is it conceivable to you that a mute or a hoarse-voiced mage can cast the intricate spells, which require the uttermost precision of the voice modulations? Or are you a person strong of spirit, the sort who expects of a wizard to walk into the fray wielding a cruel dagger, and come out of it alive, if the cause is just?~
@52   = ~Oh, I get it. Please, Xan, do rest your voice. I apologize for my untimely curiosity and vulgar insensitivity.~
@53   = ~But of course! Charge is the best kind of strategy! Or was it tactics? The Nine Hells! The bestest ever is what I mean!~
@54   = ~Is that why you carry a sword, then? I mean, it's better than a dagger.~
@55   = ~I suggest that you gag Edwin and send him into the fray, wielding a cruel dagger. That should demonstrate quite clearly the chances of a mute or a hoarse-voiced mage who cannot cast the intricate spells, requiring the uttermost precision of the voice modulations...~
@56   = ~Why had not I think of that before? Charge is the best kind of strategy! Or was it tactics? The Nine Hells! The bestest ever is what I mean!~
@57   = ~Is that why you carry a sword, then? I mean, it's better than a dagger.~
@58   = ~This sword is one of the Moonblades, given to the elves by Seldarine. These sentinel weapons bond themselves to their wielders, no matter if they walk the path of a fighter, or the path of a sage. Moonblades belong to chosen leaders among Elves, those who can protect the Elvendom from goblins, orcs, drow and our other ancient enemies.~
@59   = ~They are passed from a worthy person to a worthy person in a family, and no man or woman of unclean spirit can wield one. The blade will kill a corrupted owner who misused its power.~
@60   = ~So, the Moonblades choose heroes worthy to wield it? You are maybe a walking and talking collection of lamentations, but your heart must be noble and pure, then. I am honored to have you as my companion.~
@61   = ~I have a theory, Xan. I do not doubt that the blade chose you because it understood that you just do not have guts to do anything that would endanger your life. So, you are a hero against your own will, committing acts of bravery and self-sacrifice while whining in terror.~
@62   = ~Neat. I want to get one just like that!~
@63   = ~Can you tell me more about Moonblades? It sounds quite interesting.~
@64   = ~You are a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of honor and some leadership skill. Be our circumstances not quite so grave, I would have forecasted that our fellowship is bound to survive for at least another fortnight.~
@65   = ~I will have you know that my father, who has departed for Arvanaith, choose me amongst his six children as the heir to the blade, because of my service to the people of Evereska as a Greycloak. Moonblade confirmed his choice. Wisdom and caution take worthy causes longer way than suicidal rush you seem to consider "heroic".~
@66   = ~And so was my meeting with you.~
@67   = ~If brief. Dying under your eyes, <CHARNAME>, however, is the only consolation I will have, when I fall to our overbearing foes.~
@68   = ~I choose to end this conversation now, <CHARNAME>, for I feel that our cooperation is threatened by your hostility. Direct some of this venom at our foes: it might take down one or two, before the rest of them overwhelm us.~
@69   = ~And they asked him: "Who had bitten your soul?" And he answered: "A beautiful one, whom I never took for a snake."~
@70   = ~I will save it then, <CHARNAME>, but you are deceiving yourself if you expect that my magic will win the next inevitable combat for you. Our position is hopeless.~
@71   = ~Not that I have ever doubted it, but now I rest assured that our cause is lost, and our lives are as valuable as a sand grain in Calimshan desert.~
@72   = ~<CHARNAME>, those blades are a gift for the ones who have elven blood in their veins only.~
@73   = ~With your precarious lineage, will you risk your life by closing your fingers around a Moonblade's hilt, even if you happen to find one yet unclaimed and hidden? Though what are the chances to find one? I believe there are none.~
@74   = ~The records indicate that no more than 400 Moonblades were given to the elves, <CHARNAME>. Whoever your true parents were, they did not leave one to you. Some say that there are Moonblades yet unclaimed and hidden, but what are the chances to find one? I believe there are none. Also, Moonblades extinguish themselves, and the magic goes out of them if the family which held it produced no worthy heir.~
@75   = ~This banter delays the moment of our death, so I am too willing to continue. The records indicate that no more than 400 Moonblades were given to the elves, <CHARNAME>. Some say that there are Moonblades yet unclaimed and hidden... no doubt, forever.~
@76   = ~Also, Moonblades extinguish themselves, and the magic goes out of them if the family which held it produced no worthy heir. In this way many were lost, though some strong-headed fools believe that a Moonblade can be awoken by a deed of valor or self-sacrifice.~
@77   = ~I never suspected that I could end up as badly as cousin Erevain. He was an *adventurer*.~
@78   = ~So, what has happened to him?~
@79   = ~At least there is one sane person in your family! Makes me feel better about Elvendom's future.~
@80   = ~Well, you are not my blood relative, but I think I learnt enough of you to understand what prompted Erevain to go away from home.~
@81   = ~Cousin Erevain intended to see the world, before joining his family in Retreat. Evidently he traveled as far as Icewind Dale. *sighs*~
@82   = ~Oh, wow! He should have plenty of tales to tell!~
@83   = ~You are sighing... Forgive me, if I am prying, but I have a feeling that something grave has happened to your cousin.~
@84   = ~Retreat?~
@85   = ~*sighs* Elvendom should learn a lesson from Erevain's fate. A group of ragged mercenaries came to the Halfway Inn about fifty years ago. They brought back Erevain's sword and diary. His... his body was found near Kuldahar path...~
@86   = ~It is a good, honorable death. Let us all meet an end like that, rather than toothless and helpless in a soiled bed, smelling the end for years, before passing away.~
@87   = ~He has departed for Arvanaith, then...~
@88   = ~I am sorry, Xan. I did not mean to bring back the sad memories.~
@89   = ~Amazing. You actually *can* look gloomier than you sound!~
@90   = ~Do you, indeed? A group of ragged mercenaries came to the Halfway Inn about fifty years ago. They brought back Erevain's sword and diary. I remember one passage quite vividly: "We are all doomed... I start to sound like cousin Xan." His... his body was found near Kuldahar path...~
@91   = ~Erevain will tell no tales, <CHARNAME>. A group of ragged mercenaries came to the Halfway Inn about fifty years ago. They brought back Erevain's sword and his diary. His... his body was found near Kuldahar path...~
@92   = ~Is anything good ever happens in this world? A group of ragged mercenaries came to the Halfway Inn about fifty years ago. They brought back Erevain's sword and diary. His... his body was found near Kuldahar path...~
@93   = ~Something good has to happen to someone, somewhere, Xan. Too bad that the peddler of happiness ever misses our abode.~
@94   = ~Oh, nothing of importance for your people. One morning you will wake up to realize that the elven lands on Faerun are empty and the elves are gone to Evermeet. Then you can rejoice and burn down our forests and cities, pillaging and dividing what was left behind betwixt yourselves.~
@95   = ~Oh, *that* Retreat! Never mind that, tell me what happened to Erevain.~
@96   = ~I am definitely looking forward to it! No annoying bloody elves, whinnying about things - what else could a person want?~
@97   = ~Your kin is leaving Faerun? Then why are you still here, Xan? I would think you would be on the first ship. Or are you afraid to die at sea?~
@98   = ~Your ignorance is disconcerting, but then again, what is not? If you do not learn of Retreat, you are doomed to be the last elf left on Faerun, <CHARNAME>. Our people are leaving this sorrowful land, and move to the island of Evermeet.~
@99   = ~Oh, *that* Retreat! Gorion used to call it Exodus... Never mind that, tell me what happened to Erevain.~
@100  = ~I'll tell you what is disconcerting: talking to you! And I am eager to be done with it.~
@101  = ~Our kin is leaving Faerun? Than why are you still here, Xan? I would think you would be on the first ship. Or are you afraid to die at sea?~
@102  = ~You know nothing, silly <PRO_GIRLBOY>! An elf who died far from home, and in a violent way, may never enter the afterlife in Arvanaith. Only a fool can forsake the elven immortality for an adventure. ~
@103  = ~I did not know. I think... maybe it is better for you to go home, to Evereska. I will take care of the iron shortage, whoever caused it...~
@104  = ~Which, coincidentally, makes you into a fool, friend Xan. Admit it, you do like the life of an adventure, despite your gloomy demeanor.~
@105  = ~I pity Erevain, and I pity you, if that is the case. Yet duty and destiny are stronger than wishes. Face the inevitable with the bravery and noblesse befit to your kin.~
@106  = ~Do you know naught? An elf who died so far from home, and in a violent way, may never enter the afterlife in Arvanaith. Only a fool can forsake the elven immortality for an adventure. ~
@107  = ~Xan, why lead an endless, but blunt life here and in Arvanaith? My blood boils when I fight, and I will not trade it for anything! You, on another hand, may go home, Xan. I will find those who are responsible for the iron shortage myself.~
@108  = ~Which, coincidentally, makes us both into fools, friend Xan. Admit it, mellonamin, you do like the life of an adventure, despite your gloomy demeanor.~
@109  = ~I pity Erevain, I pity you, and I pity myself. Yet duty and destiny are stronger than wishes. Let us face the inevitable with the bravery and noblesse befit to our kin, Moonblade wielder.~
@110  = ~You did not. Under these grave circumstances, the memory of Erevain and what it foreshadows for myself are always on my mind. If you survive longer than I, which I doubt, promise me to bring the Moonblade back to Evereska.~
@111  = ~I promise, Xan. Do you have someone in particular in mind for me to pass it? A son? A daughter? A brother? A sister?~
@112  = ~Xan, I will do what is required. But I will not deny that I will be tempted to lift it from your hands and fight on for the cause of goodness.~
@113  = ~I think... maybe it is better for you to take it to Evereska yourself. I will look into the iron shortage, and find those who caused it...~
@114  = ~'Tis a decent thing to do, aye. I will do it, if the death won't take me afore ye.~
@115  = ~I have better things to do than go fetch things for snooty nobles.~
@116  = ~*sighs* A small hope of that. The more I travel, the more I grow convinced that the sun of our lives is lowering into the ocean of tears. Under these grave circumstances, the memory of Erevain, and what it foreshadows for myself, are always on my mind. If you survive longer than I, <CHARNAME>, which I doubt, promise me to bring the Moonblade back to Evereska.~
@117  = ~I have my duty to the Elvendom, <CHARNAME>. I am doomed to die fulfilling it, but it is mine to carry out for as long as I can. Speaking of my impending end, I have a request for you. If you survive longer than I, <CHARNAME>, which I doubt, promise me to bring the Moonblade back to Evereska.~
@118  = ~If only your blade was as sharp as your tongue, and as quick in the battle, we might have had a slim chance of living for another day...~
@119  = ~Step carefully. You have no right to speak of my people with disrespect. I...,I myself berate my kin oft enough, but when an outsider does it... I am likely to challenge you to a fight.~
@120  = ~It was not you that appointed me to the task I am carrying out. You have no authority to relieve me of it. If, against all odds, I shall return to Greycloak Hills, it will not be before I have done my duty.~
@121  = ~*Xan looks at you worriedly and walks away, fumbling a healing potion, for some reason.*~
@122  = ~*sighs* We are all doomed, nonetheless.~
@123  = ~Whoever from my family still lives. The blade will choose afterwards.~
@124  = ~This way lies madness, <CHARNAME>. Many temptations are black, yet this one is white, and the road to the Nine Hells is paved with the white stones.~
@125  = ~I offer you my gratitude in advance, as, by apparent reason, I will not be able to do it after the fact.~
@126  = ~Suit yourself. It is not like I expected decency out of you. ~
@127  = ~*sighs* Evereska... I could be gazing at the verdant valley of my homeland right now. Instead, I am making my way through dust, darkness and slime. It is ironic that I, who was born in the most beautiful place upon Toril, shall die in one of those dirty... holes, without a single ray of sun to shine upon me.~
@128  = ~Tough luck, Xan.~
@129  = ~Would not you prefer the moon to shine upon you at the hour of your death? You are a grey elf, after all.~
@130  = ~A half-rotten barn, full of horse dung, beats this place as far as aesthetics is concerned. I cannot believe that it somehow brought the fabled beauty of Evereska to your mind.~
@131  = ~Close your eyes, so not to see the revolting ankle-deep muck, pinch your nose shut, so not to smell it, and stuff something in your ears. Then you can imagine that you are in Evereska.~
@132  = ~Long have I looked at it before leaving. I foresaw that I would not see the spires of the College of Magic and Arms, the high temples, and the Evereskan mountains again. *sighs* ~
@133  = ~Keep talking, Xan. So, there is a College of Magic and Arms in Evereska, temples and mountains. What else?~
@134  = ~Do you want a bet, Xan? This silver ring against your Moonblade that we shall walk Evereska's streets together soon enough!~
@135  = ~Xan, bleed your heart as long as you want, but do so in silence!~
@136  = ~At least if I die, I would not have to listen to the insults. My kin is not "grey", <CHARNAME>.~
@137  = ~Lle holma ve' edan... I shall translate for you – you smell like a human. Which is unsurprising, since one of them raised you. Now, I'd like to spend the last moments of my life as pleasantly as I can, so keep away from me. I wish to smell slime and listen to the sucking sound the mud makes.~
@138  = ~I find the contrast almost unbearable myself. *sighs* ~
@139  = ~Good. The more you suffer, the more you whine. And your whining makes me laugh.~
@140  = ~Maybe you can tell me of some of the Evereska's famous attractions? It will distract you from the grim reality for a bit.~
@141  = ~Ah, do not despair, Xan. We shall walk Evereska's streets together soon enough. I promise you. I'd put this silver ring against your Moonblade on that!~
@142  = ~What purpose will closing my ears serve?~
@143  = ~Not to hear me laughing when you slip and fall face-first in the dirt!~
@144  = ~Not to hear yourself screaming when you stop deluding yourself.~
@145  = ~For completeness.~
@146  = ~I do not like the shape, that's all.~
@147  = ~Not to hear me approaching to kiss you, silly...~
@148  = ~There are palaces of noble families in grand styles, especially in the parts removed as far as possible from where non-elves are allowed...~
@149  = ~Oh... Do you mean that there are restricted areas in Evereska?~
@150  = ~It must be beautiful!~
@151  = ~And what else?~
@152  = ~Well, if by some miracle we will survive, I might be able to escort you through some parts of Evereska. But do not expect much welcome for a <PRO_RACE>.~
@153  = ~Oh... Do you mean that <PRO_RACE>s are not wanted in Evereska?~
@154  = ~Until then, tell me more of the Evereska's famous attractions. It will distract you from the grim reality for a bit.~
@155  = ~Enough chatting for now. Let us keep out eyes and ears opened.~
@156  = ~Keep your ring, <CHARNAME>. It is too crudely done. Oh, if you only could see the work of Evereskan silversmiths. *sighs* You won't find anything but the most basic of Evereskan work here. They sell a damsel's ornamental silver-bladed dagger, or a belt knife sometimes to an outside trader, but no more than that. ~
@157  = ~I heard that they sell little of what is made in Evereska, and buy even less. That's true, then.~
@158  = ~Tell me more of the Evereska's famous attractions. It will distract you from the grim reality for a bit. ~
@159  = ~Silence? In this warren? Cannot you hear the steps of our foes in the dark, the wailing of the lost souls and the clicking of the undead's bones? We will not go in silence, <CHARNAME>. This... this cacophony will be our requiem.~
@160  = ~Laugh, if you wish... it will add up beautifully to the sound of our foes' steps in the dark, the wailing of the lost souls and the clicking of the undead's bones. This... this cacophony will be our requiem.~
@161  = ~Why not. It will blend well with the sound of our foes' steps in the dark, the wailing of the lost souls and the clicking of the undead's bones. This... this cacophony will be our requiem.~
@162  = ~Oh... *sighs* It is hardly worth the effort of trying.~ [%tutu_var%XANNN23]
@163  = ~Do not think I will endure your insults indefinitely.~ [%tutu_var%XANNN34]
@164  = ~Well, if by some miracle we will survive, I will return to Evereska. You are welcome to come with me. You are an elf, so I should not have too many troubles in receiving a permit to allow you the entry, and escorting you around the city.~
@165  = ~Well, if by some miracle we will survive, I might be able to escort you through some parts of Evereska. But do not expect much welcome for a <PRO_RACE>.~
@166  = ~Oh...Do you mean that <PRO_RACE>s are not wanted in Evereska?~
@167  = ~That... that is quite unexpected, my lady <CHARNAME>. You do have a nerve, to think of kisses with death looming over us all. Should the circumstances be different... *sighs* But they are not.~
@168  = ~Indeed, only those who have legitimate business within Evereska, and are of elven background, are admitted to the city. Harpers can enter as well, while dwarves, half-orcs and the like will not be admitted under usual circumstances.~
@169  = ~You know, I have changed my mind. I would never want to go to Evereska. It sounds too... unwelcoming.~
@170  = ~Erm... how can one do any trade and such, if those are the rules?~
@171  = ~Sounds like a very reasonable arrangement to me. With elves losing their lands continuously, it is natural that they maintain such a stronghold.~
@172  = ~Indeed. Alas, I am not so see it again...~
@173  = ~There are terraced gardens, and lawns full of blooming flowers, and the tall bluetop and duskwood trees, fountains and streams without count... musicians playing at will, and artisans displaying their craft under the skies...~
@174  = ~*sighs* But what is the point of recounting? The visions only burn my eyes, for they are unreal, a thing of memory. *sighs* let us return to the reality, <CHARNAME>. We are in the dark, and doomed to die in another instant.~
@175  = ~Indeed, we require nothing of the outside world, but the curiosities from the far away lands... For them we trade a minor scroll, or glasswork, or wine sometimes. Halfway Inn served us as a trading post for a few centuries. It is outside of the valley, and turned into a lively market place lately.~
@176  = ~It is not like you have much choice, <CHARNAME>. We are all doomed to die here.~
@177  = ~Halfway Inn served us as a trading post for a few centuries. It is outside of the valley, and turned into a lively market place lately. The merchant caravans come for artwork, minor magic items and such, while some in the city are curious to buy the curiosities from far-away lands.~
@178  = ~Still, it is all in vain. Sooner or later Evereska will be overrun. Already drow, Zhentarim, orcs and countless others try to break through our defenses. They hold for now, thank Corellon, but the future of this world does not include elves. Evereska will be lost like Myth Drannor, or abandoned.~
@179  = ~The mist is thickening. It reminds me the Greycloak Hills, where I dwelled before starting this ill-omened investigation. I wish we had at least one Walker of the Mists to guard our backs here.~
@180  = ~While we are on the subject, can you tell me what is truly going on in the Greycloak Hills? Is it true that the whole city of the Fallen Kingdom was discovered, full of the powerful Netherese magic and other treasure?~
@181  = ~I thought you were from Evereska! Where are these Greycloak Hills?~
@182  = ~The Walker of the Mists? Sounds like some monster, if you ask me.~
@183  = ~This, <CHARNAME>, I cannot discuss with you.~
@184  = ~There are more rumors about what's happening in the Greycloaks than eyes on a beholder! Sooner or later the truth will come out!~
@185  = ~I guess I will just have to find out for myself.~
@186  = ~*sigh* What about these Walkers? Are they some sort of a secret, as well? ~
@187  = ~So much for trying to be polite!~
@188  = ~Greycloak Hills were once called Tomb Hills. They are located north of Evereskan Mountains, and were settled by the elves of Evereska to protect the borders from many banshees who lurked there.~
@189  = ~I remember hearing about it now. But rumors said that was not banshees, but the treasures of the Fallen Kingdom hidden in the tombs in those Hills that made the elves make the move.~
@190  = ~I see. But why change the name? Did Tomb Hills sound too grim for the elves?~
@191  = ~In short, something of no interest to anyone but the local population. ~
@192  = ~They are golems conjured from the magic mists surrounding the Hills, and each of them can crush our group effortlessly. Fortunately, they serve with the Greycloak's patrols, not fight against us.~
@193  = ~Sounds like Greycloak Hills have powerful defense system. Hmmm... I wonder if the rumors of the great treasure found in Greycloaks are true.~
@194  = ~Magic mist? What for? I understand a mage or a priest conjuring rain during drought, or a wizard who breaks up the clouds when he does not want his robes soaked... but a mist?~
@195  = ~In short, something of no interest to anyone but the local population.~
@196  = ~Not from my lips, which will be sealed for good very soon, anyway.~
@197  = ~I advise you against it. A grave robber will find his own grave in the Greycloak Hills.~
@198  = ~I am sorry to be so abrupt. I spoke without thinking of Greyhome, but there is little I can tell to an outsider of it.~
@199  = ~They are called so after the magical mists which surround the Greycloak Hills now, warding off the intruders and blocking certain forms of enchantments.~
@200  = ~And the Walkers of the Mists are...~
@201  = ~I wish you spoke the truth. Alas, the Greycloak Hills attract all sorts of elven enemies, and our job in defending Greyhome grows ever more difficult.~
@202  = ~The magical mist in the Greycloack Hills wards off the intruders and blocks certain enchantments. The mist here does naught but hides our foes... Be wary, <CHARNAME>, our doom is near.~
@203  = ~I believe I understand you a little better now, after seeing the company you choose to keep.~
@204  = ~Keep them? No, no. Those bodies would have been no use at all, the condition they were in.~
@205  = ~I suppose that not speaking to you is as futile as doing so. I merely meant that those "gentlemen" were not to my taste.~
@206  = ~No. As poorly butchered as they were, not even Montaron's secret barbecue sauce would make them palatable.~
@207  = ~Incredible! Does your stomach actually rule your mind – or, I should say, your tongue – completely?~
@208  = ~Of course not. But buttered sole, a little green salad and a light chianti, wouldn't that improve your outlook on life?~
@209  = ~No. But it's the least repellant idea I've ever heard from you, so let us pursue that.~
@210  = ~No. Then I would compound other miseries by bumping into *you* every time you stopped to gawk at a toadstool.~
@211  = ~What do you want now, Ajantis? Are you planning on 'smiting' me?~
@212  = ~All evil must be destroyed one day. With your constant wishing for death, I'm sure it won't be far off for you.~
@213  = ~And you? How long do you expect to live? Do you even think you'll live through this misadventure?~
@214  = ~It would not matter to me, whether I die today or tomorrow. As long as I continue to fight for a just cause, I will have hope.~
@215  = ~What makes you believe your cause is so just? You're a servant. A lackey. If the Order told you to jump off a bridge, you'd probably do it.~
@216  = ~My cause is just, because it is to rid Toril of evil. The Order would not have ordered it without good reason.~
@217  = ~You poor deluded soul. What gives you the right to decide what's good and what's evil?~
@218  = ~Helm's guidance will show me the true nature of others.~
@219  = ~Then, clearly, you're one of Helm's neglected followers.~
@220  = ~Alora, why can't you walk like the rest of us, instead of your foolish prancing.~
@221  = ~Because it's fun to skip! Come on, Xan, try it! You'll see!~
@222  = ~Unlike you, child, I would rather die with dignity.~
@223  = ~Come on, smile! Here, smell this flower, and let positive energy flow in.~
@224  = ~Oh, wonderful, you killed a flower in deluded hopes of me joining in your fantasy world.~
@225  = ~Xan, I WILL tickle you if I have to. You will smile.~
@226  = ~You'll do no such thing, little halfling! *sigh* Why did I ever open my mouth?~
@227  = ~And again you adhere to the predictable actions of *another* follower of a god that deems only the suicidal to be worthy for glory. Must you always walk into the middle of our foes and smite them 'nobly'?~
@228  = ~I have yet to see any more efficient solutions to life's problems, oh depressive elf. Mayhap 'tis possible for you to charm all those who would wish us harm into being our friends, instead? Corpses can't be dispelled.~
@229  = ~When one is in acquaintance to this party, one does not need enemies. *sighs* Their chances of survival *against* us is much better than with us.~
@230  = ~Bring no new life to the world, which is unable to cope with what exists already.~
@231  = ~Xan, I am afraid I have no choice in that matter now.~
@232  = ~I cannot understand how you dared to bring a child into the world woven of tears?~
@233  = ~Tears? Ah, Xan, Namara is going through one of those growing periods right now, I am sure she'll be sick of crying really soon, and then – no tears any more.~
@234  = ~You are as careless as the majority of our kin. The tears she sheds now are nothing, compared to those she will shed once she perceives the inevitable doom waiting for us all.~
@235  = ~Xan, my world is brighter than yours is, and as for Namara... I will do everything for her to grow up happily.~
@236  = ~Do you think you can overcome destiny, Coran? Hopeless is our road, and there is no escape from doom.~
@237  = ~Not only you engage yourself into pointless quests, you also chose the least probable way toward success.~
@238  = ~Whatever you are talking about, Xan? I am no defeatist.~
@239  = ~I am talking about all mad things you do, Coran! You are eager to balance on thin branches or climb cliffs under the pouring rain in the name of saving us a few hours by finding a round about route! Your own talents will be your doom.~
@240  = ~Nonsense, Xan. Lady Luck smiles at me, and I would be a fool to reject her advances. So I smile back and go. Besides, you cannot imagine the thrill... and it earns smiles from other ladies too.~
@241  = ~I doubt that Lady Luck will be nursing you when you will break your neck. Or any other lady for that matter.~
@242  = ~Ah, you never know. A tragic hero, and especially the one on the verge of death, is irresistible to some women. I remember one noble lady... she was ice while I was whole, and fire when I was gravely wounded... I could hardly recognize her. Listen, I will tell you the whole story...~
@243  = ~Coran, be honest for once! Confess that your bravado covers the dread of loneliness, and your reckless behavior is your way to escape the hollow life you loathe.~
@244  = ~As cheerful as ever, aren't you, Xan? I think about it in this way: if we are all doomed, why in the Nine Hells can't we meet death laughing?~
@245  = ~As a Greycloack, I observed the intrigues of humans for many years, Dynaheir. I should forewarn you that you are a prime example of a person who meddles into the events far greater than she is.~
@246  = ~It occurs to me that not knowing mine task thou cannot judge mine actions. Unless thou knowest mine task.~
@247  = ~Mistress Dynaheir, the aura of mystery, in which you shroud your every move, tells me that you presume to deal with something far too grand for you... and thus, no matter how competent you appear on the surface, you will fail. Such failure usually means an untimely and quite unpleasant death.~
@248  = ~Ever thou sound unsure of success. Why, I suspect that be mine goal to lift a feather off the ground, thou would'st doubt the outcome. I wilst not take thine words to heart. Thou would'st have every person to stand still and rot, as all actions are futile.~
@249  = ~I have drunk wine at funerals of many people strong of spirit, who thought themselves able to alter the fate of others, of the whole nations even. Alas, I have a foreboding that you will be one of them.~
@250  = ~Xan, I have a foreboding that thou would'st drink far more wine in mine company in a tavern than at my funeral.~
@251  = ~The thirst to engage in unavailing enterprises will lead to human's eventual extinction. Alas, this shall come too late to prevent the fall of Elvendom.~
@252  = ~Not glancing in my direction while making similar statements will assist you in looking slightly less of a fool, simian. (Why, even your inferior mind can grasp the importance of my quests, even if you cannot appreciate the enormity of my accomplishments.)~
@253  = ~Thayvians are a nation which breeds wars, Edwin, and thus bringing on the demise of humans. Yet you say that it is the glory of Thay you wish to achieve, making the whole exercise fruitless. You do nothing more than advance this folly in a small way, since the only task you have been engaged in, since we had the misfortune to meet each other, was killing another human. As for the enormity of the accomplishment, a thug in Baldur's Gate does just so more than once in his lifetime, and brags less of it.~
@254  = ~Long eared, yet short minded. It's the "when" and "whom" means in killing. If the action itself was of any significance, than even <CHARNAME> has <PRO_HISHER> claim to greatness for all these *xvarts* <PRO_HESHE> managed to defeat so bravely.~
@255  = ~Someone else's deaths became our only hope to see another day, and still you begrudge <CHARNAME> the body count. *sighs* I almost wish that you were amongst <CHARNAME>'s opponents, Edwin. After all, <PRO_HESHE> has luck of sorts on the battlefield.~
@256  = ~I have quite firm notion that your death will improve my chances of survival, Eldoth. Or at least it will relieve the pain I feel when I am forced to look upon you.~
@257  = ~Oh... I suppose after such a warmhearted wish I can do nothing but live as long and as well as I possibly can. Regardless, that was always my goal.~
@258  = ~*sighs* Alas, death always chooses the best and the brightest first, so you might indeed live long, Eldoth.~
@259  = ~I will gladly cede the honor of early death to you, even if that proves the quality of a person. Besides, you will only be comfortable with life after you die. I can never understand why do you bother with sticking about on the Material Plane, where everything is so adverse to your gentle physic and psyche.~
@260  = ~The majesty of the forest makes me feel insignificant. *sighs*~ [%tutu_var%XANNN12]
@261  = ~That's better than what some miserly townling, who deems himself greater than the Mother herself could say, but still WRONG! GRRR! In the forest one should feel EQUAL to all living things, not insignificant!~
@262  = ~*sighs* Do you ever speak but folly, wench? Only a lunatic will consider himself an equal to the sentinel trees, one branch of which can squish him in its fall, or to a beast, which can flatten him with one playful strike of its paw.~
@263  = ~What difference does it make in who kills whom? Big or small, all creatures in the forest live and die in harmony. One's death is someone's beginning.~
@264  = ~It will surely be my greatest pleasure to think in the moment of my death that a vulture will not go hungry, or a fly will have a place to raise her family.~
@265  = ~I am glad that you are starting to see things in the brighter light, Xan.~
@266  = ~Faldorn, talking to you is only marginally better than fighting alongside with you. May I ask you not to add to my sufferings? By Seldarine, the day is already as grim as they come...~
@267  = ~What's wrong with my fighting, elfman?~
@268  = ~Faldorn, you yell as I have never heard anything to yell at the fiercest foe, you can spot and laugh when he charges you... or someone who stands next to you, casting a very complicated spell. I would not mind the total lack of self-preservation on your part, but you being unconcerned with my safety is annoying in the least.~
@269  = ~Grrr! I do it because-~
@270  = ~How dare you to doubt my self-preservation instinct! I live by the will of the Great Mother!~
@271  = ~I am doomed... the wind always blows the fire's smoke my way, and the rain always starts just when I remove my cloak... now here is an insane barbarian who had chosen me to be her shield wall...~
@272  = ~Xan! I do not use you! How I chose to fight has nothing to do with you! Only the strongest survives. If I want to be among the Great Mother's champions, I have to prove my strength to her!~
@273  = ~I will be quite grateful to you if you proved it... at a distance from me. I prefer to pick my enemies by myself... the sort against whom I will survive the longest.~
@274  = ~Alas, this conversation is amongst the most pointless I have engaged myself recently in. The foes swirl around <CHARNAME> like flies around honey, and it is the matter of mere days, until we succumb to their charge.~
@275  = ~Must you always sing about the joys of life, Garrick?~
@276  = ~Of course, life is wonderful, full of surprises, twists and turns. It could take you in any direction.~
@277  = ~And where do you think all these directions end up?~
@278  = ~Happiness, glory, love. All the things that make a great tale.~
@279  = ~*scoff* Happiness, love and glory? Is that what you think? All paths in life lead to pain, suffering and death.~
@280  = ~Well... I suppose it would end up there some day, but wouldn't the happy things make it all worthwhile?~
@281  = ~Maybe you should pull yourself out of the warped fairy tale you seem to be living in, and take a nice long look at reality. People die, some in pain, others in peace. Its something you can not avoid. And then, you can watch your 'happiness', your 'glory', and your 'love' all go down the hole it came from.~
@282  = ~All things have an end, Xan, but those ends are just passages to a new beginning.~
@283  = ~Ah, Garrick... Tell me, is life feeling particularly glorious today? Where's your cheer? Where's your joy? Oh, that's right...~
@284  = ~Xan... Not now... Please...~
@285  = ~No, I think it's about time you open your eyes. Look upon the dead figure of the once fair Skie.~
@286  = ~So Garrick... Are you feeling 'glorious'?~
@287  = ~I... I could have...~
@288  = ~What? Protect her? Save her from the clutches of death? You can't even look upon the dead, can you? You'd prefer to be blind and ignorant.~
@289  = ~So how does it feel, having a loved one taken away from you?~
@290  = ~How can you be so unaffected by death, Xan?~
@291  = ~I have witnessed more than my fair share of death... Even for an elf.~
@292  = ~Run away, child. Run away, if you can, from this doomed fellowship.~
@293  = ~Huh, but I've already run away, Xan. From Candlekeep. Now I'm sticking with <CHARNAME>.~
@294  = ~Does a solemn vow bind you to <CHARNAME>?~
@295  = ~Nope. Friends don't need stuff like that. I help <CHARNAME> to stay alive, and <PRO_HESHE> guards my back.~
@296  = ~A praiseworthy example of loyalty in this doomed world. If more were exercising such beautiful feelings, the world would have had hope, I guess. Regretfully, even you are already involved in the suicide race, which seems to be the way of peoples nowadays, and have no exit.~
@297  = ~Life is hollow, Jaheira. Deep down you understand this, druid, and thus you try to fill the void with whatever comes your way: fighting drills, spiritual rituals, marriage and much more besides.~
@298  = ~Nothing of the kind, Xan. I'll have you know, that in my opinion, people who take too few responsibilities upon themselves will regret bitterly the wasted years on their death-bed.~
@299  = ~Yet, the more tasks you undertake, the more failures you encounter.~
@300  = ~And more successes. If you do not have stomach for failures, you might as well lie down and die.~
@301  = ~*sighs* With this attitude, it is no wonder that we barely escape with our life every waking hour. If I were you-~
@302  = ~I would have concentrated on the druidic duties. At least then, no matter how you died, they will say you have died of natural causes.~
@303  = ~Dwarf, you still have some half-chewed food clinging to your beard from yesterday.~
@304  = ~I have no time to groom myself in the morn', elf. I ready my axe, count my money, and I'm ready to go.~
@305  = ~A groomed dwarf? Is that even possible?~
@306  = ~Don't know too many dwarves that act like pansies.~
@307  = ~No, they're probably all counting their gold and gems, like the filthy and greedy creatures that they are.~
@308  = ~I'd watch my yap, if I was you...~
@309  = ~Searching the horizon for enemies? Or merely another regiment of orders from your wife?~
@310  = ~I'm just looking. I've never b-been here before, and I like seeing new places.~
@311  = ~I suppose that is no more idiotic a way of passing a weariness than any other.~
@312  = ~I'm surprised you d-don't appreciate it. Th-This moment, this view – the combination is unique, you know.~
@313  = ~So is each tooth on a saw, I daresay, yet they all abrade in very much the same measure.~
@314  = ~Perhaps you should walk with your eyes shut, then, if they cause you such p-pain.~
@315  = ~Alas, our enemies grow stronger every day. Surely, I shall never see Evereska again...~
@316  = ~Tell me of Evereska, mellonamin. Maybe it will distract you from your dark thoughts. It is a sweet name, the safe haven, the place which all of us wish to visit one day...~
@317  = ~It pains me greatly to destroy your illusions, Kivan. Evereska is as doomed as our kin. Its fragile beauty shall be whipped away, when the hordes of barbarians will kill its last defender.~
@318  = ~Our people are on the wane, that is true, Xan. I do believe that Evereska will survive...~
@319  = ~Elven destiny is sealed, Kivan. The doomsday is closing, and I foresee that you and I, we are to witness the ultimate demise of our nation.~
@320  = ~Xan, our people have hope. I traveled long, and I saw how we doom ourselves by repelling those who wish us well. We shall not turn away from them, as we shall not turn away from the Half-Elven. Then there will be hope.~
@321  = ~You see hope in half-blood? Your delusions would be highly amusing, if only they were not so sad. This road you are so eager to take in your folly leads to the same destination, only with more twists and turns along the way. The blood will run thinner and thinner, and shall disappear in a generation or two. The doom is near.~
@322  = ~Be as it may. I only hope that I live long enough to avenge my wife.~
@323  = ~You see it wrong, Kivan. Your wife is among the lucky ones who are spared the torture of knowing that they are the very last of their blood. Your cause is noble, but it is no less pointless than any other one undertaken in those inopportune times.~
@324  = ~One cannot choose his times, he lives and dies with them.~
@325  = ~Around you I almost feel that we have a chance, mellonamin Kivan.~ [%tutu_var%XANNN37]
@326  = ~I value your companionship, as well. May the wind be ever warm on your face.~
@327  = ~Still, I cannot help but think that your prowess is that of a desperate. You woo death in the same way another man might court a fair maiden.~
@328  = ~You are mistaken, Xan. While I do not avert my eyes in the face of death, I do not run toward it either. I made a solemn promise to avenge my wife, and I want to die knowing that I fulfilled my vow.~
@329  = ~Then maybe you will live a while yet. The irony of gods is such that they will keep you safely through the Nine Hells themselves only to see you fail in the end and have a good laugh.~
@330  = ~You are forgetting one thing, Xan. Shevarash never laughs.~
@331  = ~You're rather unusual for a warrior, Minsc...~
@332  = ~How so, little elf?~
@333  = ~Most warriors don't have... ahem... rodents as pets.~
@334  = ~Boo is not a rodent, he is a Miniature Giant Space Hamster! And he is my animal companion, he advises me on many things.~
@335  = ~It... advises you? Tell me, what is it advising you now?~
@336  = ~He says that you are a source of great sadness... Why are you sad?~
@337  = ~I'm fine... really.~
@338  = ~*squeak*~ [GAM_48]
@339  = ~What's that, Boo? Ah, yes, good idea indeed!~
@340  = ~Boo says that you should give him a hug. That always cheers me up!~
@341  = ~I'm not hugging a hamster...~
@342  = ~Miniature Giant Space Hamster!~
@343  = ~*sigh* Whatever.~
@344  = ~Kill 'em and loot 'em. The genuine Montaron touch.~
@345  = ~They puts me t' th' bother o' killin' 'em, they may as well recompense me fer th' trouble.~
@346  = ~"Bother" and "trouble". Do you never recognize the futility of running so in circles?~
@347  = ~At times. That last lot, they coins were so clipped and sweated, a blind beggar wouldn't hardly touch 'em. That were feudal enough for they had naught else.~
@348  = ~Bah! Your vision will never rise above the particular to the appalling fatuity of Life itself.~
@349  = ~Ye mebbe right. Ye have convinced me o' the fat-headedness o' one particular life fer sure.~
@350  = ~I would love to be buried under a rose bush, Quayle.~
@351  = ~Erm, Xan, and what relevance does *this* have to the discussion we were just having?~
@352  = ~You, talking about your brilliance, exhausted me, and being exhausted, I am more than likely to fail to counter the attacks of the mighty foes that are, beyond doubts, waiting behind that bush... or amongst the branches of that tree. Since my luck runs lower than ever these days, it will probably be you who will bury me. Hence, I advise you on my preferences.~
@353  = ~Hmm... amusing. It reminds me of the peculiar burial ceremonies I have read about previously. Some peoples prefer to be put on the pyre with all their wealth, and go up into smoke, some prefer the tight embrace of wet dirt, some would rather lay at the bottom of the sea... and you want to be buried under a rose bush.~
@354  = ~It is a very accessible place of burial at least, better than those folks who want themselves carried up the Spine of the World and be left for the birds of prey to pick their bones clean.~
@355  = ~*turns pale* Quayle, please, can we talk of something else?~
@356  = ~But you have started it!~
@357  = ~Your future unfolds quite clearly before my eyes, Safana.~
@358  = ~Ah, yes. I can see it too, darling. A Queen of a far-away land full of riches, or a Guildmistress...~
@359  = ~It is not that I expect you to be more realistic than everyone else in our blissfully ignorant company, but you have the sort of primitive cunning, which makes you to undertake attempts at survival, however meager and unapt.~
@360  = ~You are even worse at making compliments than this pirate Lord I met once. "Safana", he would say, "your breasts are just like bloody sails full of wind..." But go on, what else did you discovered about me? Mayhap there is a pearl in this pile of fish guts.~
@361  = ~The women of your sort, with vulgar beauty, greedy eyes and an insatiable ambition...~
@362  = ~No, no...Make it "perfect beauty", "shiny eyes" and the "wish to get what is merited", and you will be much closer to gaining my benevolence.~
@363  = ~As you wish. Women of the said sort end up in rags once the only thing that is truly theirs – beauty – deserts them. In your case, human, the years will steal your treasure from you before long.~
@364  = ~Darling, you are hopeless.~
@365  = ~The whole life is, Safana.~
@366  = ~Another day, another pointless exercise in futility. What hope do we possibly have of triumphing against the might of our enemies?~
@367  = ~Male, your whining is irritating me. Continue to complain, and I'll remedy the problem by removing your tongue.~
@368  = ~You need not be so rude. I am simply stating facts; the odds of our success are long indeed. Our foes are powerful and numerous, far more so than our laughable little band, and they shall crush us in an instant when they gather sufficient will. That much is obvious.~
@369  = ~Such an attitude is typical of male weakness! At least you don't try to cover your cowardice with male bravado! We shall triumph because I, at least, am strong and destined for greatness. If you lack the spine for a good fight, then go home and stop wasting our time.~
@370  = ~I shall continue on, but only because I am doomed regardless. I owe a debt to <CHARNAME>, one which I intend to repay, however hopeless <PRO_HISHER> cause. However, I must confess that I am growing weary of your bigotry and rudeness.~
@371  = ~I wonder, why do you bother with wearing your clothes, Skie?~
@372  = ~Xan... Erm... if there was a tournament held for it, you would have been the least likely man to get me out of my breeches.~
@373  = ~I am not prone to indulgences, such as entangling myself with a human, who will doom her elven lover to the elaborate suffering of the immediate parting. No, Skie, the frivolous thoughts do not cross my mind when I look at you.~
@374  = ~I am glad to hear that! As I said, you are the last man... But what brought this nonsensical question then?~
@375  = ~I was thinking of the eagerness with which you discarded the protection offered by your station, fortune and noble birth, and I was puzzled by the fact that you clutch to something like silks and satins, which will not stay an arrow, will not shelter you or feed you.~
@376  = ~I am Skie Silvershield, and nothing will change that, Xan. My father will eventually understand how the things are between Eldoth and me, and then he will welcome us back. Of course, becoming famous adventurers is going to help. Adventurer, not some beggar or a mercenary! I absolutely have to dress appropriately.~
@377  = ~That explains things quite adequately, Skie.~
@378  = ~We tilt at disaster after disaster. I can hardly believe that the miracles last, and we came through all that have been alive.~
@379  = ~Tiax told his stupid slave before that Great Cyric's patronage will guide every follower of Tiax safely, as long as Tiax needs him. Now, fall to your knees and praise Tiax for your salvation! All of you can join in!~
@380  = ~I do not wish my last memory to be a recollection of me bowing to an insane gnome.~
@381  = ~Mad? Me? It is you who are mad, rebelling against the all-powerful Tiax! Against Tiax who will rule the world starting the day before yesterday! Or is it the day after tomorrow at dawn? Tiax does not remember, but it was promised, and he who was promised always comes at dawn... The Prince who was promised... Tiax. KNEEL!~
@382  = ~I am starting to understand what my cousin Erevain Blacksheaf meant when he advised me about the School of Illusionists. "Fool others with your magic", he said, "but above all other failures, be afraid of fooling yourself into believing into your own mind's creations."~
@383  = ~KNEEL!~
@384  = ~Seldarine, there is a destiny worse than death... keep me from losing my mind, please keep me from losing my mind...~
@385  = ~Tiax has no time for punishing his slaves, he is returning to his conquest. Tiax shall draft the plan of bringing Sigil into the alliance against the Underdark, who still resists the word of Cyric!~
@386  = ~On another hand, there is a certain degree of happiness to be found in the state of delusion. Maybe that is exactly why we are doing what we are doing right now, <CHARNAME>? Our every day's brushes with death are certainly madness.~
@387  = ~I have not imagined that I should live not only to see, but to *become* an elf pleading of a drow for healing.~
@388  = ~*phew* Darthiir, your kin always begs of mine.~
@389  = ~Drow weave lies, like spiders weave nets. They lie even to themselves.-~
@390  = ~Lie? Waela rivvil, I have seen the likes of you crawl on their bellies, kissing the dust under Matron DeVir's feet asking to end their suffering. Their pale hides were torn, and the entrails were drugging after them, as they asked for death.~
@391  = ~I... I will not take healing from you, Viconia. Come to think of it, it is pointless for me to be healed. With the drow among the allies, who needs enemies to be murdered?~
@392  = ~*laughs*~
@393  = ~It is well you are mad, Zhent. Otherwise you might perceive that your folly is greater than the others'. They merely hope for something from life. You hope for something from Unlife both now and hereafter.~
@394  = ~Oh, we all must have our dreams. What's the point in living otherwise?~
@395  = ~What indeed? Apart from personal fantasies, there *is* no point.~
@396  = ~In that case, why aren't you dead?~
@397  = ~I have not yet been called as yet; nothing more, nothing less.~
@398  = ~I can help you with that. Let's call Monty. Good behavior is a most uncomfortable bed for him to have rested on, all this time.~
@399  = ~And when your toy assassin has done his bit, you'll have a fresh body to play with?~
@400  = ~Well, Monty's rather a sloppy worker, but I might just have a peek. Seeing if I could preserve even a smidge of your spell casting would be quite the challenge.~
@401  = ~Try it, and you'll both see more than just a "smidge" of my spell casting.~
