@0    = ~Where do you think we should inter Gorion's remains? Khalid and I have been discussing this. We are his closest friends, but you are his next of kin, so we want to know your opinion.~
@1    = ~Let him lie where he is. I shall build a proper mausoleum over the site when all of this is done.~
@2    = ~Why should you care about a proper burial? As a druid, don't you think that as long as he's incorporated back into the earth, anywhere is fine?~
@3    = ~Candlekeep was our home, so I suppose that's where he should be finally laid down to rest... assuming those bastards would even let us back in for that.~
@4    = ~A noble sentiment, but the jackals won't necessarily share it in the meantime.~
@5    = ~Bury that sharp tongue. Yes, I am a druid, but also his friend. And not all places on Toril are equally sacred, least of all a site where a dear friend has been murdered.~
@6    = ~Oh, they shall let us in eventually. I wish that we had a tome of leather parchments made from the hides of the bandits who attacked you, to pay for our entry. That of the one who had slain him shall be saved for the cover. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, for sharing such a grim thought, but Khalid and myself... we loved Gorion dearly. It is not easy to speak of burial, when his murderers still walk unpunished.~
@7    = ~Did Gorion ever show you much of the forests or teach you about Nature? Feel free to ask me any questions you might have about them at anytime. In fact, when we are traveling through the wilderness, I would prefer you pay close attention to my counsel or allow me to lead.~
@8    = ~Is it true that one can have fun killing mosquitoes by tensing one's muscles as soon as they bite? I heard that contracts the pores, thus trapping the mosquito, while at the same time squeezing a lot of blood into its body and making it explode.~
@9    = ~What is the most reliable and nutritious forest fare to be had, if I run out of provisions?~
@10   = ~Forest lore, hmmm... How did you and Khalid first meet?~
@11   = ~That is one of the silliest things I have ever heard. But I'll wager that has become a popular myth in more than one realm, imaginary or not.~
@12   = ~Grubs, no question. And roasted, they're tasty: think of nuts with a creamy center.~
@13   = ~How is *that* related to forest lore?~
@14   = ~Well, you are a lady of the forest, and Khalid is a man of the woods... Erm... it is a bit of a stretch, but I couldn't think of a more opportune time to ask, without seeming to pry.~
@15   = ~It is not related to forest lore, Jaheira. But I am curious.~
@16   = ~If you do not want to talk about it, let's talk about forest lore. What is the most reliable and nutritious forest fare to be had, if I run out of provisions?~
@17   = ~I'll indulge your curiosity, <CHARNAME>. The first time I saw Khalid was at a ball. We both were... we both had to attend on business, but neither of us knew the other. I had done what I had to and was about to leave, when I saw him standing all by himself. He looked so awkward and shy that I felt sorry for him and came over to talk. I found him surprisingly charming, and we got to know each other better...~
@18   = ~Hmm, funny, Khalid told me the same story, only he said it was *you* who was standing all by yourself.~
@19   = ~How romantic! I bet you had a lot of fun when you found out that you both were engaged by the same organization. But enough of idle conversation. Let's talk about forest lore. What is the most reliable and nutritious forest fare to be had, if I run out of provisions?~
@20   = ~Oh? That's an interesting... piece of lore.~
@21   = ~<CHARNAME>, the growing crease of worry in your face as you read that letter makes me grow worried. Is there something so upsetting in Gorion's words? Since I knew him well, I might be able to explain...~
@22   = ~I don't think you could, Jaheira. You see, Gorion is not my true father. I am one of the Children of Bhaal... I am a... Bhaalspawn.~
@23   = ~No, no... everything is fine. No need to interfere, Jaheira. It's just a minor thing, nothing worth discussion, really. Heh heh.~
@24   = ~You... you knew, didn't you? You knew about this and would not speak! You... you betrayer!~
@25   = ~You are one of the Children, then... so that is it. I knew you were somehow special, from the way Gorion chose to abandon his adventuring days and seek seclusion in this fortress. I should have been able to guess earlier, from those nightmares you were having.~
@26   = ~This is worrying... and it might explain some of the less honorable deeds you have committed.~
@27   = ~I will stay with you, regardless. Now that I recognize what pulls you off the right track, we will find it easier to conquer. I will help you to combat the call of your blood... whether you want my aid or not.~
@28   = ~Thank you, Jaheira. I am glad to know that you won't turn on me now. It means... a lot.~
@29   = ~So you really didn't know about this? It's odd that Gorion would have told you nothing.~
@30   = ~Bah! Combat the sweet, alluring call of blood and murder? Are you out of your mind, druid? Why would I want to do that?~
@31   = ~This changes less than you might have thought, <CHARNAME>. You have shown yourself as a decent and caring person, despite... this heritage.~
@32   = ~I will continue to stand by your side and help you come to terms with this newfound knowledge. If you would accept my aid, of course.~
@33   = ~Heh heh indeed, <CHARNAME>... as you would have it. You lead this group, and I shall obey your wishes, though I hope you will reconsider and tell me what bothers you.~
@34   = ~What do you speak of, <CHARNAME>? I will have none of this, being called these insulting names, knowing nothing of what you accuse me!~
@35   = ~Hmm... perhaps I overreacted... you see, Gorion writes that he is not my true father. I am a child of the dead god of murder, Bhaal... the discovery, it really... has shaken me to the core...~
@36   = ~That you knew I was a Bhaalspawn and did not tell me, you Harper whore! You and all your meddling lot, you are always keeping your petty little secrets, only to stab me in the back later. That's what makes me call you betrayer!~
@37   = ~Yes, I have to agree that it is odd, for Gorion was always honest and never secretive in his dealings with me. He cared for Khalid and me, and taught us much... perhaps he thought that knowing this might endanger us, and wanted to prevent that? Who can say... I think he planned to tell us when he asked Khalid and me to come to Friendly Arm. Alas...~
@38   = ~Yes... I suppose that makes sense. I did not want to question your loyalty, Jaheira. Let's just continue on with our quest.~
@39   = ~I don't know, Jaheira... I wish I could believe it, but I fear that the necessary trust has been broken. It would be better for us to part, I fear.~
@40   = ~I see that you need a lot of help, and do not even realize that yourself. That will not stop me from helping you, and you better hope that I succeed.~
@41   = ~A... a Bhaalspawn? You are one of the Children? I... I suppose I should have guessed. But trust me, please, I did not know of this until now! Gorion had not told us, and I can only guess that he was about to do so! Quench this anger, for it is unfounded!~
@42   = ~Perhaps... perhaps I was a little harsh... but I can't believe Gorion would have not told you about my heritage!~
@43   = ~Empty words of a cold-hearted traitor! I am tempted to ask you to draw steel, bitch!~
@44   = ~You wish us... to part? But we are so near the resolution of our quest and in delivering the deserved vengeance to Gorion's murderer!~
@45   = ~Some of the things you have done in the past had been hard to accept and tolerate, so perhaps the idea of parting has some merit. I will still see Gorion's murderer brought to justice; perhaps it is better that Khalid and I not seek this while in your company.~
@46   = ~Some of the things you have done in the past had been hard to accept and tolerate, so perhaps the idea of parting has some merit. I will still see Gorion's murderer brought to justice; perhaps it is better that I not seek this while in your company.~
@47   = ~It pains me to know that I have failed to earn your trust, <CHARNAME>. You are a good person and I would have wished to remain in your company... Please, I will ask once and only once more... reconsider, and allow me to stay with the group. I have nothing to feel guilty for in my dealings with you, but I would ask for one more chance to gain your trust.~
@48   = ~It pains me to know that I have failed to earn your trust, <CHARNAME>. You are a good person and I would have wished to remain in your company... Please, I will ask once and only once more... reconsider, and allow me to stay with the group.~
@49   = ~I have nothing to feel guilty for in my dealings with you, but I would ask for one more chance to gain your trust.~
@50   = ~Very well, Jaheira. I will give you that chance, you did sound sincere.~
@51   = ~I am very sorry, Jaheira, but this is where our partnership ends. Goodbye.~
@52   = ~I will not fight you, despite your taunts. Instead I will leave you to rot with your hatred. Or you could prove yourself a vessel of your dead father's power and stab me in the back as I leave; I am too disgusted to care.~
@53   = ~Khalid, come with me. Let us leave this one on <PRO_HISHER> chosen path to bitterness and anger. We shall observe how <PRO_HESHE> fares on this path... from afar.~
@54   = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>... you cannot imagine how relieved I am! I will not fail you, I promise... my oath to Gorion and my loyalty to you will be ever strong.~
@55   = ~*sigh* Goodbye then, <CHARNAME>. I wish that we would meet again, and I hope your view of me has improved by then. I wish you well on your quest of vengeance... be well, <CHARNAME>.~
@56   = ~Yes, please, <CHARNAME>... we care for you and your well being, it would b-break our hearts to part now. Please, d-don't do this. Let us stay to h-help you and c-carry out the oath we gave to G-Gorion.~
@57   = ~Very well, Khalid. Very well, Jaheira. I will give you that chance, you did sound sincere.~
@58   = ~Yes, t-thank you, <CHARNAME>... we will both d-do our best to help you. It would have b-broken our hearts if you had d-decided otherwise...~
@59   = ~I... I r-really wish it hadn't come to this... I am truly sorry that this d-didn't work out, and I wish we would not part with your view of us b-being so soured. Perhaps... perhaps Jaheira and I will c-continue to work b-behind the scenes to aid you... and I too hope that we meet again...~
@60   = ~I g-guess it is for the best, my d-darling. This excursion has been d-disappointing on too many occasions...~
@61   = ~Come with me, Khalid. We shall seek to avenge Gorion's murder by ourselves. Meanwhile, I hope that <CHARNAME> will use this time of separation to contemplate <PRO_HISHER> chosen path.~
@62   = ~I am c-coming, love. And <CHARNAME>... d-don't even think about c-carrying out your threats. My blade will strike you down before you could t-touch a hair on her head... and t-those are not empty words.~
@63   = ~Ahem! Actually, we were *both* standing by ourselves... but getting back to wood lore - did you know that grubs can be quite tasty?... No one can cook them like Jaheira!~
@64   = ~Will you be alright, should you be on your own, Ajantis? I overheard <CHARNAME> making <PRO_HISHER> next plans, and it might not include you.~
@65   = ~You must have heard wrongly, my lady Jaheira. <CHARNAME> and I are bound by honor!~
@66   = ~Calm down, Ajantis. Honor is sometimes more complicated than that.~
@67   = ~Complicated? I have always thought that word was a convenient excuse for the oathbreakers. One either has honor, or he does not.~
@68   = ~Don't take <CHARNAME>'s decision as a personal rejection of you, Ajantis. As our leader, <PRO_HESHE> must consider the balance of the entire group.~
@69   = ~My devotion to <PRO_HISHER> cause will outweigh any other considerations.~
@70   = ~Yes, if that devotion is mutually understood and shared between you and <CHARNAME>...~
@71   = ~And have you the reasons to doubt such understanding? I do not.~
@72   = ~Still, I would advise you to take <CHARNAME>'s decisions amicably, even if it will go against your idea of what is honorable.~
@73   = ~And m'lady herself will be amicably accepting if <CHARNAME> decided that it would be the best for the party, if Khalid and herself were replaced?~
@74   = ~But <PRO_HESHE> would not do that! Khalid and I... *sighs*~
@75   = ~Of course not. I won't worry about <CHARNAME> rearranging <PRO_HISHER> companions yet, m'lady, though I appreciate your concern.~
@76   = ~Once I asked Khalid whether he thinks you would have wanted to join a party without any females present.~
@77   = ~To which the inestimable man replied?~
@78   = ~Well, he said that he himself would definitely not want to be in any party without *one* particular female present. Smart and diplomatic, as always.~
@79   = ~I agree with Khalid. I would rather not adventure without pleasant female companionship... but unlike him, I do not mind some variety...~
@80   = ~I have a theory as to why you were so set on bounty hunting for wyverns, instead of other magical beasts, like ankhegs and winter wolves.~
@81   = ~Surely it is obvious: they are a worthy challenge for my tracking and fighting skills, and no trophy of any other beast fetches higher prices.~
@82   = ~Your martial prowess wasn't mentioned, but I said to Khalid that I thought you might have needed the heads ground up for a key ingredient in some sort of virility potion some quack fobbed on you. Khalid said that he thought you might have been enamored of their long-~
@83   = ~How illuminating! Why, it never crossed my mind before that someone might need a potion to increase his masculinity. But now that I have met you and Khalid, I can see how some people must be desperate for it!~
@84   = ~Dynaheir, do you and Minsc require some privacy?~
@85   = ~No, Jaheira. The plans we art making art not of secretive nature.~
@86   = ~I only wanted to tell you, now that we have more people in the party, there is no need for Minsc to keep watch while you sleep. You can sleep together... at the same time, I mean, while Khalid and I keep watch, and in turn, you and Minsc can keep watch while we, erm, sleep...~
@87   = ~'Tis very kind of thee, Jaheira. Thou art ever so attentive to *everyone else's* needs.~
@88   = ~Indeed. Khalid and I can give you tips for setting up your resting area for privacy needed for meditation, spell preparations and the like - yet still reasonably in touch with everyone else. We do have much field experience in this area.~
@89   = ~I appreciate thy advice, but all the same we would keep to our past vigils. However, I would like to ask a favor of thee.~
@90   = ~Yes? ~
@91   = ~I would like that extra bedroll from thine store. Mine is full of crumbs. I suspect that Minsc set Boo to guarding me again... alas.~
@92   = ~Since Minsc is not within earshot to come rushing to kill you, let me ask: why do you hate Dynaheir so, Edwin? Jealousy?~
@93   = ~Are you implying that I am jealous of that half-wit protector she adopted?~
@94   = ~No, but perhaps you are jealous of the fact that she is a very skillful mage.~
@95   = ~You and the rest of the chimps in this party will eventually come to know that I am and I will be the best mage you can ever hope to meet. *I* will never let myself be captured by gnolls or any other creature that is so clearly beneath me.~
@96   = ~If you're as good as you say, mage, care to help tutor Imoen in the arcane arts, should she decide to take it up? I wouldn't want you to teach her anything besides that, of course.~
@97   = ~What? Why would I want to have that brat on my hands?~
@98   = ~Aha! Not enough a master of your art to be sharing it with others? Or is it professional jealousy, fear of being surpassed by one's own apprentices?~
@99   = ~Speaking of jealousy, woman - of the *non*-professional variety - that is a feeling that I doubt your husband will ever experience.~
@100  = ~Why, thank you for complimenting me on my steadfast honor and loyalty, Edwin. I didn't expect it of someone so foreign to such concepts as you.~
@101  = ~Bah! I meant (why do I waste my time trading banters with creatures far beneath me... no, be patient, Edwin, suffer them for now) that no other man will have you!~
@102  = ~I know what you meant, mage. That was the sound of my barb flying past your head. Perhaps there has been a shortage of irony, as well as iron, from where you hail, hmm?~
@103  = ~Half of my wit would still be more than yours and your whiny husband's combined, druid. Seriously, my suggestion to you is to take very good care of him, for it is apparent to me that he'll be your only shield against a lonely, desolate life.~
@104  = ~If that is your idea of a withering blast, mage, then I yawn at it - much better persons than you have been much more cruel and been sent scurrying away whimpering. But if it is indeed a threat to my husband, mage, then you are very close right now to losing *all* of your wits... in pieces on the ground.~
@105  = ~Garrick, did you know that Silke was planning to murder those merchants back in Beregost?~
@106  = ~What?! Do you think, sir, er, madam, that I would knowingly and willingly participate in such activities?~
@107  = ~Did you even have a clue what kind of a person Silke was, before you hired on with her?~
@108  = ~She seemed pleasant enough, and she was very gifted. And she had a goodly purse-~
@109  = ~-and you will do just about anything to get new material for your songs...~
@110  = ~Hey! Well, come to think of it... you got me there.~
@111  = ~You've known <CHARNAME> all of your life, Imoen?~
@112  = ~Yep, and we've always been pals. Well, we do sometimes get on each other's nerves, but we're always there for each other when times are tough, and there's nothing we won't do for each other... erm, I hope I am not being too gooey and sticky, and that I haven't nicked everything from the cliche store!~
@113  = ~Nevermind that!~
@114  = ~Huh? Did I say something wrong, Jaheira?~
@115  = ~I am sorry, Imoen, but I need to know. I don't know how to ask this delicately, so let me put it straight. You are the only person besides Gorion who knows <CHARNAME> well. Have you ever noticed anything especially different about <PRO_HIMHER>?~
@116  = ~Eh? What do you mean?~
@117  = ~I am interested in certain aspects or behaviors that seem... out of balance, or haunted.~
@118  = ~Yes, sirree, definitely! <CHARNAME> has this annoying habit of leaving <PRO_HISHER> clothes all over the place! That's just so rude and... haunted! But I bet you'll find out other weird stuff about <PRO_HIMHER> as we go along.~
@119  = ~You are right, Imoen. There is plenty of time and opportunity for us to get to know <CHARNAME>. If only Khalid and I could have visited with Gorion more often... But what's done is done. We will acquaint ourselves with <CHARNAME> now.~
@120  = ~What do you want to do when you grow up, Imoen?~
@121  = ~Well, I was thinking of studying magic... Hey! How come you never ask <CHARNAME> that? I'm not much younger than <PRO_HESHE> is!~
@122  = ~I doubt that <CHARNAME> will have much choice in what <PRO_HESHE> wants to do in the future. No, do not ask me why... But you're right, if I don't think of <PRO_HIMHER> as a child, then I'll try not to think the same of you... providing, of course, that your behavior matches the desired maturity.~
@123  = ~Hah! Look at Ms. Wanna-be-party-leader-who-sulks-if-she-has-to-stay-in-the-back talking of maturity! *giggles*~
@124  = ~And I'd bet you'd have some advice ready for me that very minute on actin' grown-up, wouldn't you, *auntie* Jaheira?~
@125  = ~Not asking everyone for stories about 'trolls and heroes' would be a start.~
@126  = ~But... but they're the best kind of stories! See, it's just that you haven't heard any good ones. Let me tell you about the one 'Puffguts' told me, which happens to be of trolls...~
@127  = ~That's enough, child.~
@128  = ~Sheesh, you're not my mother and never will be, Jaheira! Heh, I just got a swell idea! Maybe if Khalid and you have a kid, you will have less of your, erm, maternal frustrations.~
@129  = ~Perhaps, my aggravations indeed root in not having a child of my own. Hmm, definitely something to ponder upon.~
@130  = ~Imoen, has 'Puffguts' ever talked to you of the things a girl turning into a young woman should know?~
@131  = ~Heh, he often talked to me of how I wasn't cleanin' good enough, and how I will never find myself a good husband if I keep climbing on fences and erm... borrowing things...~
@132  = ~Yes, those are useful instructions, but I meant other sorts of things. You're of age now, and I think it is my duty to forewarn you.~
@133  = ~Forewarn me of what?~
@134  = ~There are a few herbs that a grown up woman should know how to prepare properly, when she starts taking interest in comely lads. First there is tansy...~
@135  = ~Cookin' bores me, Jaheira. I don't need to-~
@136  = ~We're not talking about *cooking*, Imoen!~
@137  = ~Oh, *what* are we talkin' 'bout then?~
@138  = ~Eh, maybe this talk can wait for a while longer.~
@139  = ~You lead us on this backtracking excursion for your caravans and then just decide to give up like that, dwarf? I doubt that someone with such lackadaisical aims and unsteady resolve would be an asset to this party.~
@140  = ~Ye dare talk to an employer like dat?! 'Tis just good business sense. My main asset is right *here* in me head to tell ye what to do, and right *here* in my arm to keep ye in line. Oh, and I've got other assets below those parts as well, though I doubt you'll ever be invited to be a partner in any of *those* joint ventures, har!~
@141  = ~Don't tempt me to test just how well you can heal on your own, O Captain of Industry.~
@142  = ~Aye, and I am glad that I do heal so well, 'cause I'd rather sleep with leeches than use yor filthy, backwoods healing, druid. What are ye standing there fer? Ye're fired!~
@143  = ~Khalid, have you thought about using a club or staff until this iron crisis passes?~
@144  = ~You are not trying to get me to switch p-profession again, are you, Jaheira d-dear?~
@145  = ~Nonsense. I just wouldn't want to see you surrounded by enemies with just a hilt in your hand. I think you should keep a wooden weapon in reserve...~
@146  = ~Yes, that m-might be a good idea. Though, as you know, none of my tools has ever f-failed me yet.~
@147  = ~That's because you're lucky to have me to keep them well maintained.~
@148  = ~And some of us just f-find sharp weapons, like words, so much more satisfying to resolve d-disputes than blunt ones. Though I must say, you can employ both with f-facility, dear wife.~
@149  = ~Hmph, flatterer.~
@150  = ~P-perhaps I can carry a spare sword or two?~
@151  = ~And *those* might break too when we're leagues away from the nearest smithy. Hmm... I knew we should have grabbed that two-hander for you... even if its price *was* outrageous. Something that can go through stone like that sword won't break any time soon.~
@152  = ~Th-that would have taken up most of our money. And we were in C-Calimport a long w-way from our... employer. N-not to mention that the merchant w-wanted us to pay for the p-potion of strength needed to pull it out from where it was s-stuck.~
@153  = ~You are right. The smiths hold their iron in such respect! *sniffs* Wood is cheap and dependable. Any piece may be carved from its root, ripped from its branch, shattered from its trunk, and it will continue to live and to hum with all of nature's vitality. *Nothing* beats a good club or a sturdy spear with a fire-hardened tip! NOTHING! Those smiths! *snorts*~
@154  = ~Ahem, c-control your temper, my dear. At least until t-tonight.~
@155  = ~Where do you want to go when this is over, Khalid? Home? To Calimshan?~
@156  = ~I know you never cared for Calimshan. And neither d-do I, for that matter, since my father never c-cared for me as he cared for his true-born sons, and my m-mother is long dead. We can go visit Tethyr... for a short while... if you want.~
@157  = ~Even if it had been - for lack of a proper word – my "home", I'd be much happier to forget its existence altogether.~
@158  = ~I... I am s-sorry, my dear. I d-didn't mean to bring back sad memories. W-we do not have to go anywhere in particular. We can continue to travel with <CHARNAME>... to keep an eye on <PRO_HIMHER>. For Gorion's sake, of course.~
@159  = ~Thank you for your understanding. I am afraid that neither your nor my childhood left us many pleasant memories.~
@160  = ~But Khalid, my love, know that to me "home" is wherever you are.~
@161  = ~I f-feel the same way, Jaheira.~
@162  = ~Khalid, will you pass me - yes, this pouch with herbs. How did you know, dear?~
@163  = ~Because th-that's the only thing you allow me to carry for you.~
@164  = ~Oh, yes. Thank you.~
@165  = ~My d-dear, you really should let me help with some of the heavier things we have to drag around.~
@166  = ~My load is manageable, and my packing skills are such that it is distributed evenly. When I cannot carry more, I will let <CHARNAME> know.~
@167  = ~I d-do not doubt that, Jaheira. It's just I w-want to take care of you.~
@168  = ~What is it, Khalid? Flowers? You know that I do not approve of cutting down flowers!~
@169  = ~I d-dug them out with the roots. So I c-can replant th-them afterwards. See... I rolled a wet cloth around the root bulb, it should not get damaged.~
@170  = ~That's better. But why are you giving me flowers?~
@171  = ~D-do I have to have a reason to g-give you flowers? They are beautiful, like you. So I th-thought...~
@172  = ~That is very sweet of you, dear.~
@173  = ~B-besides, today is... is... our anniversary of a k-kind.~
@174  = ~Anniversary? Khalid, are you sure?~
@175  = ~Yes, I had p-proposed to you for the f-fourth time on that day. Do not you r-remember?~
@176  = ~I remember now, dear... And I am still sorry that I was too unsure of your feelings at the time to accept at once.~
@177  = ~*chuckles* I had to convince you somehow that my feelings for you were m-more serious than a patient's gratitude to his healer. P-proposing seemed like the right way of doing it.~
@178  = ~*smiles* And you did it differently every time... What if we elude everyone tonight and celebrate appropriately?~
@179  = ~There is only one th-thing a husband can say to his good wife to that.~
@180  = ~"Yes, dear!"~
@181  = ~I'm very sorry to hear about your mate's fate, Kivan.~
@182  = ~Deheriana departed for Arvandor, Jaheira. She is beyond the sorrow and grief of this world now.~
@183  = ~I can't imagine – and don't want to imagine - how it would be for me if I were to lose Khalid.~
@184  = ~Jaheira, do not let such grave thoughts cast shadow during the sunny days of your life. The time of grief can come so suddenly... and nothing can prepare you to face it.~
@185  = ~If I might ask: what was she like?~
@186  = ~Can you describe what starlight is like? Look at the sky by night, and you will see her woven by silver mist among the stars... Or maybe she is only visible to my eyes?~
@187  = ~Well, the way you speak of her... I'm sure that all your sacrifices are not for nothing... Oh, never mind...~
@188  = ~Khalid... Khalid! Oh, here you are. I... I just wanted to kiss you, my sweet love.~
@189  = ~You know, Minsc, Khalid and I have encountered many types of creatures wild and tamed in our travels, yet we have never heard of a Giant Space Hamster.~
@190  = ~Are you doubting Boo's character? Boo can speak for himself. Here, you are a druid, and you should understand what he says.~
@191  = ~Minsc, there are limits to any druid's ability.~
@192  = ~What!?! You doubt the words of Minsc and Boo? What kind of druid are you?~
@193  = ~There are things in Faerun I never imagined I would encounter, no matter how far, how often, and how long I travel! But I like seeing new things and learning.~
@194  = ~Boo just told me he wishes to learn something from you.~
@195  = ~Go ahead.~
@196  = ~How many stones are required to make a hedge?~
@197  = ~It depends on the hedge, Minsc.~
@198  = ~Boo says that he knows now what you meant when you said that there are limits to any druid's ability.~
@199  = ~Montaron, I'll let you know before we camp that Khalid and I *are* light sleepers, so take care which direction you tread should you... oh... just happen to get up in the middle of the night.~
@200  = ~Aye, but best ye don't bed too close to me, so I have to suffer yer elf smell. I just might mistake where ye lie for our latrine when I get up to relieve meself.~
@201  = ~And one of us might mistake you for a wild beast, and you'll end up even shorter, halfling. I can't say I'll regret such a mistake.~
@202  = ~Bah! Wood hen, ye have yet to learn that standin' tall aren't the best way to stay tall.~
@203  = ~I couldn't help but notice that you've been appraising me continually, Shar-Teel.~
@204  = ~You are the right sort of woman, Jaheira. And you know how to keep the sissy males on their toes. I do not think that I myself can stand one so close and for so long, but you schooled your hubby well. He is practically your servant, your boy-page... that's not that bad.~
@205  = ~Nothing of the kind! Khalid is NO servant to me. We swap *all* our chores...~
@206  = ~Bah. And you are surprisingly effective in battle. Looking at you when we first met, I thought you'd be useless. You are too lithe of form, you see. Much weaker than me. Much weaker.~
@207  = ~This city is an eyesore to anyone who has ever seen the true majesty of the open plains or the endless forests. Why people would dwell in such hovels, when nature's beauty lies so close to their doorsteps, is beyond me!~
@208  = ~They obviously have erected such hovels to escape Tiax's wrath! No matter. When Tiax rules, he shall sweep through these streets and burn these houses that his servants might know that there is no escape! Yes, a great purge is in store for this city!~
@209  = ~Is there no subject, Tiax, which you cannot turn into an insane rant about what will happen when you "rule all"?~
@210  = ~Tiax controls all conversation, for it is yet another tool that Tiax might use to enlighten his servants as to their eventual enslavement at his hands!~
@211  = ~How about the weather? Surely you cannot turn the weather into...~
@212  = ~When Tiax rules all, thunderclouds and rain shall hail his emergence as Cyric's champion and lightning shall crackle through the air that all might see Tiax's mighty form superimposed against the background and despair!~
@213  = ~Very eloquent, if makes no sense. How was your last meal? I doubt very much you'll find a connection to world conquest in THAT!~
@214  = ~When Tiax rules, ALL his meals shall be delicious, and all shall sit well in his stomach, for Cyric shall not tolerate his champion suffering indigestion! Tiax will devour entire feasts single-handedly and shall eat off the backs of his slaves, lashing them when they dare to move and spill Tiax's drink! Tiax shall hold mighty banquets for his most dedicated servants, feeding those who have obediently served and starving those who have dared to FAIL Tiax! THIS WILL BE DONE!!!~
@215  = ~But... errr... my last meal wasn't that bad.~
@216  = ~A single coherent thought pulled from a stream of nonsense. Unfortunately, it isn't reward enough for me to continue with this idiocy.~
@217  = ~That Flaming Fist fellow spoke of you being wanted "for murder of the foulest sort", drow. I am still wondering whether he meant that in the past or *very* recent tense.~
@218  = ~Your constant suspicion of me is predictable and tiresome, tu'rilthiir. But go on. Just what exactly were you implying?~
@219  = ~Tell me, drow, have you killed anyone *not* in self-defense while you've been on the surface?~
@220  = ~I have not, but I think I might be very close to doing so now, elg'caress.~
@221  = ~However, even you can see the delicious irony in the fact that the death of the moronic jaluk chasing the drow trophy made me a murderess in the eyes of *your* law. And in that murder I was aided and abetted by <CHARNAME> and...~
@222  = ~How dare you! If I ever find out that <CHARNAME> was mistaken in taking you in, drow, nothing will stop me from having your head!~
@223  = ~Really? How very amusing. *hisses* Try to take my head off, elg'caress, and I swear that yours will be the first one rolling in the dust.~
@224  = ~Viconia, I'm... curious. You say that you have rejected Lloth, but why do you worship Shar, a human goddess, and not another Drow deity... Vhaeraun or Vendargolth?~
@225  = ~*hisses* Vhaeraun? Vendargolth? Your ignorance of our politics and culture is clear.~
@226  = ~How so?~
@227  = ~While I am forced to admit that I agree with *some* of their ideals, as they ally with Shar, I will not bow to a lowly male! Their followers preach that a male can stand as high as a female! Such nonsense no true drow would tolerate. I am Viconia of House DeVir, not renegade *male* iblith!~
@228  = ~What of Elistraee, then?~
@229  = ~I spit on her name. That... that powerless joke of a goddess!~
@230  = ~Come here, Viconia. Quickly, now!~
@231  = ~Pfeh. What new cause have you found to bark orders, tu'rilthiir?~
@232  = ~Do *not* lash out at me. Let me show you how to make yourself more useful, drow.~
@233  = ~I simply plan to impart some practical knowledge of our surroundings. It's not as though you have it in abundant supply. This plant, here, is rather common in these regions. It has numerous curative properties, not the least of which is-~
@234  = ~I... will never grow accustomed to this surface world. Never will I dwell contentedly among these greens...~
@235  = ~So be it, drow. If you do not wish to hear my advice, I need not bother to share it. I don't see why <CHARNAME> should want to keep around a healer unaware of her surroundings, were <PRO_HESHE> to hear of this.~
@236  = ~Pfeh! I...~
@237  = ~I have reconsidered. Speak of your art, druid, and I will listen.~
@238  = ~You're fortunate to have caught me in an obliging temperament. As I was saying... this has numerous curative properties, not the least of which is cleansing the body of various poisons...~
@239  = ~Does the forest lift your spirits a bit, Xan? No matter how bad I feel, just being around trees makes me feel better. For some strange reason, being around maple trees especially improves my temperament.~
@240  = ~The forest does not cheer me as it does you, druid. Their beauty is one of the few things that astounds me in this world; they will be standing far longer than the tales of our group's failures. They make me feel insignificant. They hide too much: too much danger, too many secrets. The woods enchant me 'til we run into the next creature, eager to rip our throats open. It is then, and with the memory of past occurrences, I realize that I am ill at ease in these woods.~
@241  = ~But you are an elf! It is most unnatural for you not to take to the forest.~
@242  = ~*sighs* And I'm sure that your 'human parent' would agree on that...~
@243  = ~Be very careful, Xan! The fact that I may straddle two worlds does not mean that I've left either of them.~
@244  = ~My apologies, but I'm merely trying to prove a point.~
@245  = ~Does every halfling enjoy living in his burrow, having five square meals a day and a pipe in the evening? Does every dwarf enjoy drudging through deep caverns, digging for gold and singing "hei ho hei ho" sixteen hours a day?~
@246  = ~Look at the companions around us. The knife worshipping braggart, Montaron, would find no refugee with his burrow bound kin. I dare say he'd kill the fellow, or claim to, who did.~
@247  = ~Look at Yeslick! Yeslick may have been a miner, but gold is far from his main concern.~
@248  = ~Kagain is not obsessed with his clan's glory or survival...~
@249  = ~Why, even you and your mate, though both half-elven, are as different as night and day.~
@250  = ~Yes, Xan, you've made your point, but I gather that you're still an exceptional exception among elves. You must feel very lonely among your kind.~
@251  = ~Which is why I am a Greycloak, druid. I find that my kind sometimes takes too much for granted in our life span. They rarely seem to consider the inevitable fact that we are all destined to dust.~
@252  = ~Silvanus' armpits! In either case, gloomy elf, staying inside would do you no good. I'm sure an improvement in your bodily health would change your perception of the world. More exercise and fresh air - which doesn't have to be in the forest. But the forest does yield many cures for ailments. Perhaps someday a root, an herb, or a bark may yield a tonic to alleviate your specific condition.~
@253  = ~My fragility is a sacrifice to my art, to my will. No doubt the herb that 'eases' my condition will cause my wit and perception to decease to an ogre's. This or that cure will disagree with mine physiology and I'll take ill and die after consuming it. *shrugs*~
@254  = ~Xan, I do believe that with you in the party, we will not be needing any enchantment spells. We'll just send you over to our enemies to "cheer" them up, and victory shall be ours!~
@255  = ~What's wrong, wizard? You look positively sober this morning, and I must say, I fear your sanity more than your madness.~
@256  = ~I've just had a painfully clear vision of the utmost terrible truth from a dream last night. We're all just pawns in a diabolical game being played by brutish entities!~
@257  = ~*snort* So what is new on Faerun?~
@258  = ~You don't understand, woman! I'm not talking about the Gods. We, our Gods and even our Gods' peppermint sticks, are not real - we're all characters in THEIR vile imaginations, created to speak, behave and act for THEIR amusement.~
@259  = ~Hmm... and what of it? Perhaps they themselves are just characters in a higher game, and so on?~
@260  = ~Ah, not to worry, then. Death's master will have them all, then, eventually. I must say, though, that I wish *I* had been accorded proper billing by whoever-it-wasn't-really, and I wish more that *yours* had been a silent part.~
@261  = ~Ah, but *I* am comfortable and content with my role in it. And somehow I don't doubt that those who may pen me are not entirely without affection for their subject. But you consider yourself far too lavishly, wizard. No wonder you are insane!~
@262  = ~How do you like the combination of the martial and healing arts, Yeslick?~
@263  = ~Aha! Ye wants ta 'talk shop', does ye, missus Jaheira? They work grand together... as some of me kin might say, like beddin' down in a dark chamber veined wi' gold. Better, if one did not bed down alone, they'd add - and were a good 'alf-century younger, p'raps. Aye.~
@264  = ~Or as some of us would say: like a walk in the park.~
@265  = ~Eh? Who needs ta bed down in a... ?~
@266  = ~No, no, no - a park within a city, thus we get the benefits of both the city and the forests. *sigh* Some jests are best not explained. I'm afraid I'm not very smooth at delivering others' jokes.~
@267  = ~Oh... right... eh, ta get back to me thoughts... I can crack skulls *and* heal meself afterwards. There's a fine thing, right there! But... I feel I'd be nay much use to any'un as just a basher o' skulls *or* a healer o' thews. *sigh* I ain't the best at one nor t'other...~
@268  = ~There's no shame in what you say, Yeslick. The marriage of our disciplines result in a force greater than the sum of its individual parts. I am glad, for example, that unlike most of nature's servants, I am trained to wear plate armor. Nature's own hides be damned when you're about to be skewered with a sword!~
@269  = ~Heh! *There's* somethin' I take fer granted. Where I grew up, ye couldn't move fer all the mail n' plate 'bout the place... Persn'ly, I'd just as soon ask Clangeddin fer the bean ta clog more noggins, but then I s'pose I got more stone an' iron in me blood than ye.~
@270  = ~*sighs* Sometimes I wish that I could have access to some spells clerics have... to be even more useful to my husband and <CHARNAME>, of course.~
@271  = ~Ay, don' lose yer patience, lass, to each his... eh, their own. I seen the Druids o' Cloakwood do some amazin' things I could never do! Summon huge hordes o' buzzin nasties an' clouds o' stingin' little buggers and send 'em at any'un who gets nasty! Eh, not that I'd *want* ta do that. *shudders* Aaack, bugs.~
@272  = ~One ability I desire to learn is to make the live skin into the likeness of metal. I have been fortunate to witness veteran druids gifted with such affinity, and they were fearsome in battle. Almost no one else matches them for staying sword or spell. And our use of healing potions would decrease considerably. Not that I use too many of them even now...~
@273  = ~I canna see Khalid bein' too pleased at ye makin' yerself look like some walkin' statue... But I hear that some druids found a cure for that too turning yerself into beauty appealing to *every* eye.~
@274  = ~N-not a difficult task for my wife, master dwarf.~
@275  = ~Aye, but I bet she'd look bonny in a beard.~
@276  = ~A *beard*?!?~
@277  = ~Aye! No offence to ye, miss, ye're comely as far as fair folk go... but beardless maidens jus' don' have it, to a dwarven eye.~
@278  = ~You must have heard wrongly, my lady Jaheira. <CHARNAME> and I are bound by a bond stronger than any other!~
@279  = ~And m'lady herself will be amicably accepting if <CHARNAME> decided that it would be the best for the party, if she herself was replaced?~
@280  = ~But <PRO_HESHE> would not do that! I... *sighs*~
