@0    = ~Coran, I see you smiling the whole day long. What fills you with this everlasting feeling of childish joy? Do you close your eyes to the evil occurrences around us? Does the misery of the people we pass make you grin?~
@1    = ~Bah, Elven sight is keener than that of grim humans. Why should I waste so precious a gift on looking at sores and ugliness? I'd rather enjoy beauty made flesh right in front of me. Truly, she has all qualities of a dream: elusive, divine, desirable - and all just a hand's reach away.~
@2    = ~Which poor little maiden has the misfortune of being the focus of your interest now?~
@3    = ~*Coran grins* Someone who wouldn't be pleased to be addressed as 'poor little maiden'.~
@4    = ~*stubbornly* I will not tolerate any further remarks if you are referring to a lady who travels with us.~
@5    = ~Ah, wild flowers... The sight always puts me to dreaming of a beautiful maiden's eyes.~
@6    = ~Just do not 'dream' through an enemy's charge, Elf.~
@7    = ~I expect that certain stiff-lipped non-romantics among our company would not miss a chance to awaken me from my reverie... if only to remind me how criminally un-diligent it is to fall in love.~
@8    = ~It is not falling in love that I find despicable, it is doing it thrice a night or more, depending on how drunk one gets and how many barmaids there are in the tavern!~
@9    = ~O, Hanali... That's quite a speech from someone who is sworn to the Order of the *Radiant Heart*! Or do you call it in private the Most Noodle Order of Rusty Spades?~
@10   = ~Rogue, there is no nobleness or purity in you, just empty air and crass jokes. I cannot fathom what any women of dignity and station would see in you. ~
@11   = ~For my part, I will be satisfied with puzzling out how men like you could adventure in the company of the fairest of women and still go on about the indecency of falling in love. One day you will understand that when a maiden like <CHARNAME> looks a man's way, he has little choice but to drown in those lovely, deep eyes.~
@12   = ~<CHARNAME> would never let some pretty elf with a silver tongue fool her. She is a... a lady! *Ajantis blushes hard*~
@13   = ~*Coran raises his brow* Why, oh why do you think that making love is some sort of a horrible torture inflicted by a man upon a woman, and that the woman must to be compensated for her suffering by becoming permanently attached to the one who dared to tresspass into her sanctuary? Perhaps, it's true for you humans, but we elves prefer to think of it as a joyous union; love lasts however long it lasts.~
@14   = ~Now I wonder if it is indeed sternness that moves you, or if it is simply good old-fashioned jealousy.~
@15   = ~Chivalrous paladin, doesn't your honor compel you to tell the truth on every occasion?~
@16   = ~This, indeed, is true.~
@17   = ~Tell me, then: isn't <CHARNAME> the most beautiful maiden to be found wandering these lands?~
@18   = ~Lady <CHARNAME> is indeed... a beautiful lady.~
@19   = ~*Laughs lightly* Aha, so it is true that paladins do not lie. As for me, I'd say you have indeed noticed her beauty, judging from the way you've been looking at her as of late... ~
@20   = ~*Turns red* I wasn't looking at her solely to entertain myself with the beauty of her appearance, like you seem to do, elf. My eyes wander to Lady <CHARNAME> because I am watching over her as a vigilant companion on our dangerous travels! ~
@21   = ~Perhaps you should double your vigil whenever I am close to the lady. We tend to get quite... distracted with one another, and you could learn a thing or two. *He winks and pats Ajantis on the shoulder*~
@22   = ~Keep your self-pleased words to yourself, wretch!~
@23   = ~Keeping vigil, Helmite?~
@24   = ~*With a slight unease* I told you that I'm watching out for dangers. I'm doing this for all of us, not only for <CHARNAME>.~
@25   = ~Then why, O Knight bold and pure, does the fiery gust in your eyes extinguish when your eyes pass from <CHARNAME> to me?~
@26   = ~*With anger mounting in his voice* I don't need your mockery, Coran! I see enough 'fiery gusts' in your wanton glances for three men! If you aren't careful, she will burst into flames just from your constant staring!~
@27   = ~Don't berate me for professing love openly for someone you secretly desire.~
@28   = ~*His voice remains calm, yet his hands tremble in anger* I do not have to justify my intentions to you, elf. The only person I would feel obliged to reveal my desire to would be <CHARNAME> herself, but I... *he stops in sudden horror* ~
@29   = ~You do that, Ajantis, before you cause yourself an injury. Repressed, your desire manifests itself through hurling insults and giving in to bouts of righteous fury. Quite paladin-like, but hardly chivalrous.~
@30   = ~Or is that your courting? Do you think that your implied steadfastness looks endearing when you are berating Coran the Wretch, Coran the Womanizer, Coran the Despicable Rogue? Yell louder then. That small tribe in Matzika might have missed you slandering me.~
@31   = ~*In a low voice, hands still trembling* <CHARNAME> is the wisest and bravest woman I have ever met, elf. I trust in her intelligence to see the *true* intentions of either of us... Before she will choose to whom she will give her heart.~
@32   = ~Love, Ajantis, should never be used to fuel anger.~
@33   = ~Hail, O fairest of all ladies.
<CHARNAME>, two men vie for thy heart.
They summoned me, a Master of Challenges
A Herald of Hearts, a Judge of Love
To arbitrate between the three of ye.
This humble servant is at thy disposal.~
@34   = ~*He bows with a flourish*~
@35   = ~Ajantis of Waterdeep and Coran of Tethir
Swear to obey my command, Mistress,
And thy choice. I can see, fair Lady,
That thou art worthy of their rivalry,
For thy beauty equals thy sagacity.~
@36   = ~Dost thou wish for me to set
A Challenge for thy suitors
To prove their love and fealty? ~
@37   = ~May I know the rules of engagement before proceeding, O Master of Challenges?~
@38   = ~Uhm, could you explain who in the Nine Hells you are, in plain tongue?~
@39   = ~*After considering a while you decide against setting a Challenge. Your heart is given to Ajantis already...*~
@40   = ~*After considering a while you decide against setting a Challenge. Your heart is given to Coran already...*~
@41   = ~*After considering a while you decide against setting a Challenge. Your heart is given to Xan already...*~
@42   = ~Wait! What about Xan of Evereska?~
@43   = ~I would like thee to set a Challenge for Lord Ajantis Ilvastarr of Waterdeep and the good elf Coran of Tethyr.~
@44   = ~Xan of Evereska? Oh, the gentleman declined, saying, and I quote: 'It's hopeless.'~
@45   = ~But if your heart is given to him, My Lady, I would encourage you to announce it now, so we can forgo the challenges.~
@46   = ~There are challenges of wit and strength that I have prepared for thy suitors, My Lady. None of them real, none of them harmful; they all are but a product of my own imagination and that of thy suitor. Thou wouldst be engaged into their dream, and participate or stand by to watch, as required. Once thou hast become engaged, 'twould appear no different from reality.~
@47   = ~The total of challenges are four, as there are four worldly elements, four corners of the world, and four is how many 'twere paid for.~
@48   = ~After each challenge, I shall ask thee to make thy choice. If thine heart is unclear to thee, we shall try again. If thou would'st not set thy heart on one of the gentlemen after the four challenges, they both agreed to discontinue their courtship. Neither of them shall attempt to sway thy mind until all four challenges art done.~
@49   = ~Dost thou wish to set a challenge now, Lady <CHARNAME>?~
@50   = ~There is no need to set a challenge, Master. I know where my heart lies, and it belongs to Ajantis.~
@51   = ~There is no need to set a challenge, Master. I know where my heart lies, and it belongs to  Coran.~
@52   = ~I would have both men discontinue the courtship, for I cannot give an offense of preferring either Ajantis or Coran.~
@53   = ~The Lady <CHARNAME> had declared her decision! She will entertain the suit of Lord Ajantis Ilvastarr of Waterdeep. Coran of Tethyr, as per our agreement, thou shalt not seek <CHARNAME>'s favor from now on.~
@54   = ~The Lady <CHARNAME> had declared her decision! She will entertain the suit of Coran of Tethyr. Lord Ajantis Ilvastarr of Waterdeep, as per our agreement, thou shalt not seek <CHARNAME>'s favor from now on.~
@55   = ~The Lady <CHARNAME> had declared her decision! Above all men, Xan of Evereska is the dearest to her heart.  Lord Ajantis Ilvastarr of Waterdeep, my good elf Coran of Tethyr, as per our agreement, ye shall not seek <CHARNAME>'s favor from now on.~
@56   = ~The Lady <CHARNAME> had declared her decision! Lord Ajantis Ilvastarr of Waterdeep, my good elf Coran of Tethyr, as per our agreement, ye shall not seek <CHARNAME>'s favor from now on.~
@57   = ~The Lady <CHARNAME> had declared her decision! Lord Ajantis Ilvastarr of Waterdeep, my good elves Xan of Evereska and Coran of Tethyr, as per our agreement, ye shall not seek <CHARNAME>'s favor from now on.~
@58   = ~Well, Lady, it is rather simple. I make my living by settling love triangles. Ajantis and Coran, your companions, want you to decide whom you prefer. So I can set the challenges for them to perform and, upon observing them, you may decide which one is dearer to your heart.~
@59   = ~Can you explain the rules of engagement before proceeding, then?~
@60   = ~After considering a while you decide against setting a Challenge. Your heart is given to Ajantis already...~
@61   = ~After considering a while you decide against setting a Challenge. Your heart is given to Coran already...~
@62   = ~I have four challenges up my sleeve: the men would fight so thou could judge their skill and agility, the men would entertain thee, the men would present thee with a courting gift, and the men would save thee from a dragon. Every challenge could be selected but once! Which one should thou choose?~
@63   = ~I would like to see the men fighting.~
@64   = ~I would like the men to entertain me.~
@65   = ~I would like to receive a courting gift.~
@66   = ~I would like to be saved from a dragon.~
@67   = ~There is no need to set a challenge, Master. I know where my heart is. It is given to Ajantis.~
@68   = ~There is no need to set a challenge, Master. I know where my heart is. It is given to Coran.~
@69   = ~Then fight it is!~
@70   = ~And now, Coran of Tethyr.~
@71   = ~Ah, My Lady thou wert not paying attention. This challenge was already called. Chose another or announce thy decision.~
@72   = ~Then entertainment it is!~
@73   = ~My heart is given to Ajantis.~
@74   = ~My heart is given to Coran ~
@75   = ~My heart is given to Xan.~
@76   = ~I will have you know that after all this, I have decided that I do not want any man to court me at all.~
@77   = ~Then a gift it is!~
@78   = ~And now, Sir Ajantis of Waterdeep...~
@79   = ~My Lady has a brave heart! Why, I wonder if it would turn out that thou wouldst save a suitor from a dragon's clutches!~
@80   = ~'Tis all my challenges, lady. What say thee? Which man hath thy heart?~
@81   = ~Nothing would please me more than to spin a tale that should bring a smile to your lips.~
@82   = ~Now, sweetling, imagine that we have traveled to Tethyr, wondrously avoiding the spite of elf-persecutors, and finally, enter the Forest of Tethir. I take you to the green city of Suldanessellar and we sneak into the Royal Palace to the Tree of Life itself...~
@83   = ~What should I give you, sweetling?~
@84   = ~Fields full of spring flowers? ~
@85   = ~The bright jewels of the Underdark?~
@86   = ~The light of the eternal stars?~
@87   = ~No... all these are but common trinkets, compared to you.~
@88   = ~I give you a mirror, sweetling, a Lover's Eyes Mirror. When you look into it, you will see yourself the way I see you now. And, since it comes from me, I'd expect it to pay a fair share of compliments to your grace and beauty.~
@89   = ~Coran, I should have guessed that you would eventually return to do more mischief. And you brought a foreigner along to these sacred halls. I assure you that this time you would not be pardoned quite so easily for your trespass.~
@90   = ~My general, if you refer to the incident of carving Fayatel's -~
@91   = ~*Lady* Fayatel's.~
@92   = ~...Lady Fayatel's initials on the Tree's trunk, I did it on her dare.~
@93   = ~Do not you ever speak of my daughter that way! You are a disgrace, Coran, and I shall see that both you and your lady-friend are taken into custody and questioned -~
@94   = ~We meant no harm, as I will gladly explain to your men. I would explain that I wished to show to my dear friend <CHARNAME> my initials on the Tree of Life... and Lady Fayatel's, as well. Of course, then I would have to tell just how I have come to know Lady Fayatel.~
@95   = ~*with a smile* I am afraid the rogue has you, my noble friend.~
@96   = ~If my disgrace can protect my Queen's peace, I am willing to suffer it by taking this... rogue into custody. I can withstand the rumors, which would surely -~
@97   = ~There is no need, General. These two are no threat to my peace.~
@98   = ~Your Grace, as unworthy as I am of arguing with your Majesty, the man, Coran, proved himself untrustworthy in his youth. He despoiled the Tree.~
@99   = ~As you have said, General, he was young, foolish and in love. The Tree has filled the carving with sap: golden for the runes and red for the heart around them. A rare maiden has a memento like that to show for her first love.~
@100  = ~Your Majesty has a merciful soul, but there are those who would use it against you. I will not tolerate a spy in the palace.~
@101  = ~A spy, my dear General? For whom would he spy? Humans? He is an elf.~
@102  = ~Need I remind your Majesty that there are people who remain loyal to the Exiles despite their vile deeds? I have reason to believe that they plan to repay your Majesty's lenience with black treachery. The Exiles escape of our surveillance proves my suspicions.~
@103  = ~O, Elhan, a man you might be, but such a poor judge of a man's heart. Jonel - the Exile - will return soon, enlightened by his experiences in the world of mortal men and women. He will learn to appreciate the treasures which he had long taken for granted.~
@104  = ~What if he does not? What if, even now, he weaves the tenets of conspiracy? What if this... scoundrel and his... lady are part of it?~
@105  = ~What if he does not? What if, even now, he weaves the tenets of conspiracy? What if this... scoundrel and his N'Tel'Quess lady are part of it?~
@106  = ~They are lovers, Elhan, not assassins. And if your fears become reality and the Exiles are indeed hatching a plot against Suldanessellar, then I have you to guard the Queen's peace, do I not?~
@107  = ~I will give my life for you, my Queen. But often, I wish that you would make protecting you easier.~
@108  = ~I know your loyalty, and I treasure it, noble warrior. But far be it from me to judge a man unworthy of mercy and redemption, and even farther, to become a prisoner in my own City. Go now, General; I do not wish for this argument to continue before a man and a woman who came to seek peace in my palace.~
@109  = ~*He bows stiffly in acknowledgement* Your Majesty.~
@110  = ~Walk with me, Coran and Lady...?~
@111  = ~<CHARNAME>, your Grace. <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, the foster daughter of Gorion the Sage. ~
@112  = ~I am pleased to make your acquaintance, even if it has happened under such... peculiar circumstances. Coran Sullussaer, was it not?~
@113  = ~I am flattered that your Grace remembers my name.~
@114  = ~Oh, it is quite memorable. *She gestures vaguely towards the Tree of Life's trunk*~
@115  = ~*He smiles sheepishly*~
@116  = ~Are you very much in love with your <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, Coran Sullussaer?~
@117  = ~Yes, your Majesty, I am.~
@118  = ~Treasure your love, for nothing is more fragile or more precious. And to you, <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, I say, 'You are blessed for you are loved.' I must leave you now - leisure time is not a luxury rulers enjoy often. Go cautiously, for I do not doubt that my loyal Elhan will not hesitate to lock you away for safekeeping until he is satisfied that you do not present a security risk. And, Coran?~
@119  = ~I will not assault the Tree again, your Grace. It was a careless thing to do in the first place.~
@120  = ~*Laughs light-heartedly* Would that everyone were so amenable to reason. Fair winds, Coran and <CHARNAME>. Fair winds and bright stars. ~
@121  = ~To deliver you from a dragon, sweetling? ~
@122  = ~Now, that is a challenge after my heart! Why, I finally get a chance to rival Tethir the Dragonslayer! O, Master of Challenges, let it be an ancient red!~
@123  = ~Coran, the Dragonslayer... that has a ring to it!~
@124  = ~Meager mortal, too small to be a midday snack, why did you come to die? ~
@125  = ~I came to deliver a fair maiden, whom you keep captive against her will.~
@126  = ~A fair... what?~
@127  = ~If you have dishonored <CHARNAME>, I swear that you will die a horrible death!~
@128  = ~Oh, her.... She dishonors herself enough without my interferance. *capriciously* How stupid could a woman be, that she cannot grasp the duties of a lady's maid? I was thinking about eating her, but she does not look appetizing.~
@129  = ~*To himself* So being a dragon does not guarantee having a good taste...~
@130  = ~Wait, did you say... Lady's maid?~
@131  = ~O, Dragon Lady, why do we waste time bantering about your maid? I have come here to behold your magnificent and glorious beauty. But I was deceived in my expectations.~
@132  = ~Puny elf, you know nothing of glory or magnificence.~
@133  = ~A correction, my Lady. I *knew* not glory or magnificence. But now that I have beheld you... no words can describe the grace and might of your neck. Your armor gleams brighter than jewels - ~
@134  = ~You think so?~
@135  = ~*With fervor* I do not think... I feel it, in my bones, in my heart- ~
@136  = ~*Quietly and quickly, to <CHARNAME>* Sweetling, the way I see it, we have two choices: You run for it while I stay behind to entertain the dragon, or I stop this farce, and I fight her...~
@137  = ~You mean 'we' fight her? That's acceptable.~
@138  = ~*Unpleasantly* And might I know just how are you going to 'entertain' her?~
@139  = ~Let me try to be fair. If a woman gave into a powerful man's demands to save her lover's life, I would consider it noble, and would berate the lover if he belittled her for that. So, I will accept your offer, Coran.~
@140  = ~That big, fat lizard will never have you! I'd rather kill her!!!~
@141  = ~Coran, how can you even suggest such a thing?! It sickens me! ~
@142  = ~O, dear. I am not letting you near this dragon, Coran.~
@143  = ~Heh, I'd rather you go on, and I'd stay around and watch. I admit that I am curious how you and the dragon can… you know.~
@144  = ~*Without missing a beat* But no matter how beautiful you are, Dragon Lady, I have come for the heart of my heart, the fairest of the fair, <CHARNAME>. Surrender her or die!~
@145  = ~*Laughs* The two of you might just do as lunch!~
@146  = ~<CHARNAME>, let your love give strength to my sword arm so I can slay this horrible monster!~
@147  = ~O... That was quite - ~
@148  = ~Spectacular! Congratulations, my hero, on your great deed.~
@149  = ~The Nine Hells, the bloody Nine Hells! Are all dragons that flimsy?~
@150  = ~I... I do not understand.~
@151  = ~What's an ancient red before a man in love? ~
@152  = ~A worm.~
@153  = ~Dragons are fearsome beasts, <CHARNAME>. But I must confess, that since this challenge is based on my dreams... it comes pretty close to how I usually imagine such an encounter.~
@154  = ~O, Coran, Coran. You people have a good saying. ‘Lle naa haran e' nausalle.'~
@155  = ~O, Coran, Coran. How does the old saying go? ‘Lle naa haran e' nausalle.'~
@156  = ~*Laugh*~
@157  = ~I am king in my own imagination? That is not a saying, sweetling, that is an insult. But right now, I could do anything for you...~
@158  = ~Harness the clouds, collect a basket of stars, fight giants or dragons... All because I love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@159  = ~I love it when you laugh. You become even more beautiful.~
@160  = ~O, how beautiful you are! Right now I could do anything for you...~
@161  = ~*Irritably* Exactly in the way you think. ~
@162  = ~Coran, how can you even suggest such a thing! It sickens me! ~
@163  = ~O, no! I am not letting you near this dragon, Coran.~
@164  = ~<CHARNAME>!~
@165  = ~*Coran's shocked exclamation alerts the dragon and it turns on you. It looks like you have run out of options really quickly. You will have to fight for your lives!*~
@166  = ~For once I hope that the saying that the Nine Hells have no fury... holds.~
@167  = ~O, sweetling, sweetling. Trust me, it is the surest way I can get you out of here. If I can match a dragon in anything at all, it would be in this...~
@168  = ~Goodbye, beloved, and know that I am doing it for you...~
@169  = ~*To the dragon* In your proud solitude, your shining perfection, do not you sometimes wish to let someone enjoy the wonders of your body?~
@170  = ~Such thoughts occur to me, yes.~
@171  = ~What is going on here? Why did you take this inferior form, Cautz'qu'ati'kan?~
@172  = ~*Quietly* Why does it always have to happen like this? ~
@173  = ~*To the dragon* Me and my wife <CHARNAME>, here, were just leaving, my good... um... lord.~
@174  = ~*ignoring Coran and <CHARNAME>* How DARE you question my actions? You have been away for weeks!~
@175  = ~*guiltily* I have been hunting, my love, simply hunting. I brought you quite an intricately armored young knight... seeing how you have complained about the lack of iron in your diet...~
@176  = ~*Elbows <CHARNAME> away* Let us go, sweetling... In my experience they will be at it for days now.~
@177  = ~Entertain you, my lady? I am trying to imagine what a lady like you would like for her entertainment. Should I recite a poem? You most probably heard a better one in the halls of Candlekeep. Should I tell you a story? You most probably read a better one in the great library. Should I give you a fighting performance? There are enough battles in your life, and it is hardly romantic enough to fill such a lady's evening.~
@178  = ~I surely wish I could take you to Waterdeep, my lady, but that is too far away for now... So I have decided to present you with something very special and rarely available. See what delight can be achieved through a combination of magic and craft work! Gond the Wonderbringer, deity of craft, construction, and smithwork, brought the smoke powder to the Lantanese during the times of troubles. It found its way here, in little packages that draw colorful sparks across the sky when lighted. But I do not want to talk too much, my lady. See for yourself...~
@179  = ~I hope you enjoyed the sight, my lady. It was a momentary pleasure, and hopefully the kind of entertainment you enjoy. I put fast burning fires of great might into the sky to impress you, my lady... hoping that you will be able to see the glowing, steadily burning fire inside my heart... *ahem* Although the first might be impressive to look at, it was over very soon. My steady flame will keep you warm for the rest of your life... if you want it to, lovely <CHARNAME>.~
@180  = ~My lady, you ask of me a gift... yes, there is a gift I would like to give to you, beautiful <CHARNAME>. It will be nothing you can see, nothing you can touch. And yet it is something that you could call your own for the rest of your life, if you accept it.~
@181  = ~<CHARNAME>, what I give to you is this: I will protect you and fight for you with all the might Helm has given me. I will walk on the path of good with you, and just as my powers protect you against evil now, they will protect you for the rest of your life, if you want them to. If... you want *me* to, my lady. I am your humble servant, lovely and brave woman.~
@182  = ~How would I save you from a dragon, my lady? With all my might, I assure you. If time would allow, I would first do research. This is more important than you might think. It is not without reason that Helm posted the dogma 'Know your foes. Careful planning always defeats rushed actions in the end'. As dragons are such powerful enemies, in this case it would be crucial to know what kind of dragon you were captured by, and what life phase it is in. Dragon's powers differ depending on their age: Would it be a young dragon, an old dragon, or a wyrm?~
@183  = ~Do you happen to know that there are ten races of true dragons, five chromatic ones; black, blue, green, red, and white; and five metallic; brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver? All of them can grow to giant wyrms. They gain immunity to non-magical weapons, as well as to spells that put them to sleep or paralyze them. All of them are immune to at least one type of elemental energy such as cold, fire, acid, or electricity, depending on which type the dragon uses for its breath weapon. This, of course, also reveals the weakness of every dragon, as they often prove vulnerable to attacks involving the opposite element!~
@184  = ~After collecting knowledge about whom I have to attack, I would gather helpers. Do not think that I am too afraid to face such a danger alone, my lady. But there is no use in running into a fight without planning, and doing it alone would mean exactly that. If available, I would take along at least one cleric, who could heal our wounds and bless the party with his protections.~
@185  = ~Then I would approach the dragon, my lady. And it could be that it goes like this...~
@186  = ~This of course was... not serious, my lady, as this was a silver dragon. Surely you know that silver dragons, like all metallic dragons, are usually friendly and helpful towards humans... I am sorry, but I could not resist. *coughs*~
@187  = ~When asking me how I would save you from a dragon, surely you were thinking about such a kind as a red dragon, the most wicked and fierce of the chromatic dragons, and especially suitable for this example, as they tend to capture *ahem* young maidens to eat... In this case all the preparations I mentioned would be crucial, as red dragons are very powerful enemies.~
@188  = ~I assure you, my lady: If there was no time for careful planning, I would approach the dragon alone to save you. If all I had was a wooden stick, my lady, I *still* would fight the dragon to save you. I would fight for your escape with all the might Helm has given me. I would give my life for yours: Never shall an evil creature lay hands on you while I am near you, lovely and brave <CHARNAME>!~
@189  = ~Greetings, mighty lady. I seek your forgiveness for the disturbance.~
@190  = ~Greetings, my human friend. What is your desire that leads your steps here?~
@191  = ~Silver light on silver scales,
Flashes high above the dales,
Like mithral shining in the night
Reflects the glow of pale moonlight.
As graceful as elven bards do sing,
Silver dragons soar on silver wings.~
@192  = ~It is <CHARNAME> I am here for, my lady. I hope you do not mind if I take her away from your blessed company.~
@193  = ~Not at all, my human friend. I enjoyed her presence, but I know you human folk always have to hurry on... So fare well, <CHARNAME>, and might your life be prosperous.~
