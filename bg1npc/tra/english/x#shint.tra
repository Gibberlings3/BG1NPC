@0    = ~*reads from the letter* '...I trust this letter reaches you. The halfling I hired to carry it struck me as an honest enough chap. Always and forever...' Blah-blah-blah...~
@1    = ~So, honest enough chap, while the fat merchant waits out in Waterdeep, you are here watering the dust of the road with your blood... HA! Honesty never saved anyone yet. The sword hand did.~
@2    = ~Hmm... so that's how it feels to think with hair on your chest. Paaathetic. Now, if you don't take the bloody thing off me in a hurry, I'll let my sword do the talking. And wipe this bloody grin right off your face.~
@3    = ~I hope so, too!~
@4    = ~I am glad that we achieved such cordial agreement on that matter, dear daughter.~
@5    = ~Now you are talking, woman! Ha, sometimes I even feel regret that I have to kill them the moment I start respecting them!~
@6    = ~If you have forgotten how to kill morons, <CHARNAME>, I'd gladly remind you...~
@7    = ~You gave away our loot to these... these... men? You... idiot!~
@8    = ~Want to bet on it, hussy? Let's see who'd come on top after I swing my sword, and you - your curves...~
@9    = ~Ooo... I know who'd end up on top, dear. And I do not mind it a single bit. I love a fighter in full plate. They just look so... hard.~
@10   = ~Ooo... I know who'd end up on top, dear. I can see it in his eyes...~
@11   = ~Ha! A halfman and a mage... Together they would do for a quarter of a valuable companion!~
@12   = ~A well muscled specimen... yes, yes, especially compared to you, dear Monty.~
@13   = ~Well, we'd pay you your weight in gold or half-a-copper. If I were you, I'd take the copper, puny man.~
@14   = ~Travel in peace? You aren't only half-man, you are also a half-wit! In peace... Bah! Are you done recruiting pathetic males yet, <CHARNAME>?~
@15   = ~You sound glad to discover that your adversary is the weaker critter. Hells and demons, but you are a pathetic one, even for a male! <CHARNAME>, this idiot would be of no use for us. We can kill the wyverns without having to share the reward with him.~
@16   = ~Not only have you agreed to kill a woman, but you insist on bringing this burdensome... weakling along! Look at him! He bends nigh in two under the weight of his staff! Are you blind or stupid, <CHARNAME>?~
@17   = ~You, Garrick, an ASSET?! Even a bard should not exaggerate so shamelessly! You, who had to hire help to fight three peasants?~
@18   = ~Look at your narrow chest! Look at your slumped shoulders! Look at your skinny legs! I bet you'd be whining for a rest after a half-day's march!~
@19   = ~<CHARNAME>, a bard in a party is not a good thing. Especially a *male* bard!~
@20   = ~<CHARNAME>, *another* bard in a party is not a good thing. Especially a *male* bard!~
@21   = ~<CHARNAME>, *another* bard in a party is not a good thing. Not to mention another *male* bard!~
@22   = ~Or do you like them... scrawny?~
@23   = ~Er... lady... er... slow down.~
@24   = ~Grasshopper, we do not need a man in the party. Moreover an elf who looks like he has not eaten a decent meal in days, but presumes that nobleness shines out of his ass!~
@25   = ~<CHARNAME>! Do you hear what I am saying? Stop ogling him... Demons and devils of the Abyss! Do you have a 'thing' for male elves? Must be the pointed ears; Woman, we need to talk.~
@26   = ~I hunt better alone, but in this fight I would welcome an ally. However, if you are not interested in joining the forces, I would not insist on travelling with you.~
@27   = ~I don't know who is more stupid - this man who speaks to his hamster, or you for inviting him along. Minsc is strong though and knows his place. Hmmm... that Dynaheir has the same taste in men as I do.~
@28   = ~No! NO! Not this bleating coward. I swear I heard the walls shake while we did battle, because of him trembling. And that voice! Xan sounds like a wailing wolf with a severe cold!~
@29   = ~This Yeslick character, he what... Reminds you of your great-great-great grandfather or something? <CHARNAME>, might I remind you that we are here to 'adventure', not to look after senile dwarves?~
@30   = ~To name this one a slime would be an offense to slimes! <CHARNAME>, the only way I would agree to have this creep Eldoth around, is if I can beat him bloody when times are too quiet for my taste.~
@31   = ~Let me guess... you took this Quayle along, because you are planning on showing him a basilisk, and then selling him as a lawn ornament?~
@32   = ~What is this supposed to be? A scaled down model of mankind? As in lots of wind, arrogance, self-righteousness, grand purposes, boasting and zilch in common sense, let alone usefulness.~
@33   = ~<CHARNAME>, have you lost your ever-lovin' mind? No? Well, you are likely, in *this* company.~
@34   = ~What forces do I ask? He only looks big. Strip him of his armor... and there'd be nothing left. It's like a wet cat, you know.~
@35   = ~Fair lady, you wound me with such bitter words.~
@36   = ~Unless you are starting a collection of toy knights or need an anchor for a boat, <CHARNAME>, I would not bother with 'joining forces' with this pompous bastard.~
@37   = ~Look at you! Strong, sturdy and with a money sense. If only dwarves were taller!~
@38   = ~Lass, listen here - if we both lay down, I'd be taller than ye. Bed and battlefield are two places where tall and short makes no difference. Skill does.~
@39   = ~Now, keep talking like that, and I'd be tempted to check the truth of this maxim for myself.~
@40   = ~So the total is - one no-nonsense woman and a dead weight - her husband. *snorts*~
@41   = ~If I were her, I'd hide that weakling somewhere safe, if I really wanted him...~
@42   = ~Must be a druid thing... No woman I know, with half a brain, would waste her time on him.~
@43   = ~Flaming Fist officer, looking for us? And NICE? I'd say we have to worry - those weaklings might well stoop so low as to ambush us.~
@44   = ~Ah, well, it's all for the best: we'd kill the whole lot without having to chase them one by one.~
@45   = ~Who's small, TenBUMMER? Who's weak? My name is Shar-Teel, and I am thinking of taking up a new hobby: clipping talons. Sloooowly. ~
@46   = ~Look, his knees turned to jelly. Squeeze this male slug harder, and he'd cough out anything you want to know, <CHARNAME>.~
@47   = ~Women do not grow wise by losing their swords, you brain-dead fool. It's men who do. Manhood for wits - I say it's a bargain!~
@48   = ~This is so tempting... <CHARNAME>, I want to see this mageling's wrath! And kill him for threatening me, of course.~
@49   = ~Oh, these tender males of Nashkel! One's gone off his rocker, and another weeps over his fate! I hope that nobody *here* dares to tell me that men are the stronger sex!~
@50   = ~It's sure nice to be appreciated. Mayor, I can clear the mines of your 'demons' with my right hand tied behind my back.~
@51   = ~I'd missed opening that black lobster's shell with my sword by a hairbreadth! I'm growing hungry for that dish, <CHARNAME>. And these good Dukes would pay top coin for Sarevok's head, no doubt.~
@52   = ~Nine hundred gold sounds like a fair price for the job. Don't be a pansy, <CHARNAME>, accept the offer!~
@53   = ~These diggers have no life to speak of, anyways. What with this drooling over some long-dead housewife's garbage?~
@54   = ~Now, that's a bounty to my liking! A smart coin for a pleasurable task!~
@55   = ~So you should be, whore!~
@56   = ~Now, I can understand the desire to kill, but other than that, you sicken me, woman. Not only are you a consort, but you are *proud* of this! You call a male your Lord and vie for his favor! *spit* I much prefer killing men, but in this case, I would take great pleasure in slaying you!~
@57   = ~Not for the pleasure of conversing with whores, that's for sure.~
@58   = ~As they say - a corpse a night keeps your spirits high!~
@59   = ~And if I won't get lost, then what? I hope that you got the guts to attack us, so I can spill them.~
@60   = ~I respect your attitude, dwarf, which is more than I can say for other males. Now let's see how well you can dance to my blade's whistling a bloody nocturne?~
@61   = ~It's a slam dunk that we did! Every man on Faerun fits this description! *laughs*~
@62   = ~I'm wastin' me time on ye idiots.~
@63   = ~I don't care a fig for what they did to you, actress, but I am always ready to bash men's heads.~
@64   = ~Law? Laws are for weaklings. Just kill the lecher. Who'd cry for a man, anyway?~
@65   = ~You got that last bit right, sister! Only they are no callous brutes; more like vapid maggots, dirty pigs, loud-mouthed weaklings, faeces of a diarrheatic monkey...~
@66   = ~Hey, too bad. You talk business!~
@67   = ~Look, he soiled himself! Let's kill him, so there is no chance that this weakling procreates. That's unless his manhood forever remains stuck between his own buttocks, like a mongrel dog's tail, from the fright we'd given him today. *laughs*~
@68   = ~Bitch.~
@69   = ~*laughs* Heewwwlp mwweee, kind sirs! What a milksop! Go help him yourself! After all, you're as able-bodied as we are... and you look like trash, but that's nothing that a shiny chain and a smear of foe's blood can't fix.~
@70   = ~Daddy? You call your father 'daddy' and run to him to heal your stupid cat? *Stares at the nodding girl for a moment.* Beat it, brat! Your dead cat's hair irritates my eyes.~
@71   = ~Oh, right! Here comes the 'daddy'! *Now* the fun starts. And you, <CHARNAME>, are a freak - picking fights with girls that are no taller than your knee!~
@72   = ~Ha-ha-ha! That's talking business! <CHARNAME>, if you run from this fight, I'll lose the last of my respect for you. Watch as I drain all the piss from this one... because I swear by the Hells, that's what passes for blood in the Flaming Fist.~
@73   = ~I grew up on the tales of mighty drow women. And now this... *spits* wailing hussy. I guess I should learn to live with disappointment.~
@74   = ~Perhaps, the drow exile the weak-spirited to the surface. *That* would explain a lot.~
@75   = ~Rivvin, in the Underdark a weak-spirited drow dies. The strong one lives, and I am not yet a rotting corpse.~
@76   = ~He's left you, and you still beg for him? I cannot figure out if that is a sign of your strength or your weakness. Stupidity, most likely. Mysterious Kara-Turian soul, my ass.~
@77   = ~Accounts? Reports? Bah! Woman, you don't look like a worm. Why would you entangle yourself with a band of feeble goons?~
@78   = ~Well... mostly favorable... reports.~
@79   = ~Go scribble, then. But the fighting is outside, and you're missing out on all the fun in this rotten inn.~
@80   = ~*dryly* <CHARNAME>, I really must attend to my contingent's transfer.~
@81   = ~Throwing underpants? Pfaugh! How about throwing up?! I'll hand you your ass on a silver plate with one hand tied behind my back and another...~
@82   = ~Holding a knitting crochet? Woman, I said *people* making challenges, *women* throwing underpants.~
@83   = ~<CHARNAME>, let's show this little pissant who's boss!~
@84   = ~Personally, I do not bother myself with memorizing male names. A whistle will do...~
@85   = ~I do not fight with scum for free.~
@86   = ~Oh, not another one who covers up the fears of being defeated with philosophical nonsense.~
@87   = ~No, I do not fight them for free: I kill them.~
@88   = ~Do you expect me to start screaming at the top of my lungs, because of your stupid lizards? I killed two yesterday; see this belt? Bring them on; I can use more! And I'll let you keep the eyes, heh.~
@89   = ~*spits* I, for one, have no desire to prove myself a gentle MAN! I'm one tough woman, and if you won't shut up and fight, I'll push your manners down your throat with my boots!~
@90   = ~I doubt not that you are ill-mannered enough to act upon your threat, but I assure you that I have taken every precaution to protect myself against brutes like you.~
@91   = ~Look at this! Men in skirts on a perch! Woo-hoo! Sc-a-a-a-ry!~
@92   = ~So, Edwin, looks like you are not the only man to wear red skirts in the wild! Oooo, do not go, my pretties. Once your fearsome friend has taken the podium, you could start a real beauty contest there! *makes a smooching sound* C'mon, Edwin, shake it, baaaby!~
@93   = ~Saving talking chickens from big bad wolves! Bah! It'd be much merrier if those were Flaming Fists that accosted you.~
@94   = ~*under her breath* Huh, your gut feeling about us is right, iron moron. We have no explanation that you'd consider *good*. Now, speaking about feelings, how about gutting this stinking fish, <CHARNAME>?~
@95   = ~The bigger they are, the harder they fall, and I always wanted a pouch made out of ogre ears.~
@96   = ~Heh, maybe you are bandits, after all! Let's see if you can fight!~
@97   = ~I've heard of you... You are Greywolf, and you will be making your apologies to Ysena in Hades to<DAYNIGHT>, or my name is not Shar-Teel!~
@98   = ~Shar-Teel? You must be the ridiculous brat Ysena scooped out of the gutter!~
@99   = ~The one and only, though you'll find me a little more than just a brat. You betrayed Ysena to the Fists, because of a quarrel over the reward for a run-away slave. I've been wanting to meet you for a long time, Greywolf - do you know why?~
@100  = ~*grins* Do enlighten me.~
@101  = ~So I can skewer your guts through with the point of my sword.~
@102  = ~Wrong!~
@103  = ~The girl Petrine says that you were *not* kind to her. To cut it short, she wants that cat. Hand it over, you bastard, or I will bring your head over to her!~
@104  = ~Kill the *pesky* thing? With pleasure!~
@105  = ~Petrine, your uncle wanted us to kill Angel. I reasoned that if we refused, tomorrow he'd find someone else. And I can not stand idle when people go around killing poor orphan girls' cats! I... I killed him.~
@106  = ~I am going to make sure that you are transferred into the care of someone kinder than your rude uncle, Petrine. Trust me.~
@107  = ~I will hunt Sarevok down, ma'am, but seeing that I could lose my life, I plead your Grace for one favor before I go. There is some unfinished business... a trivial thing. An orphan girl, Petrine and her cat, Angel need a proper guardian. I... I killed her uncle – a mean man who mistreated her, and yet she was left with no soul in the world to protect her. 'Tis a blood debt.~
@108  = ~Rise, my good <PRO_LADYLORD>. You have my word that as long as I command power and authority in this city, the girl Petrine should be raised as my own... and Angel the Cat will find welcome in the palace as well. Now, do not tarry, Sarevok has to be destroyed for his crimes!~
@109  = ~That goes to show that even among Chill, men are as pathetic as elsewhere.~
@110  = ~We will fight for our coin, you dolt, unless <CHARNAME> is a worthless rag.~
@111  = ~What?! You're a coward, <CHARNAME>. *she spits* I don't even want to dirty my blade on your craven blood. Starve! I'm going to take what's mine from Chill.~
@112  = ~Finally! You two have too much liking for talking. Gods, but I love bloodshed.~
@113  = ~As they say:
Met mage by morning,
adventurer take warning
dead mage at night
adventurer's delight.~
@114  = ~Consider this, <CHARNAME>. *She points to all the corpses* We're all but done -just need to finish off this one. We don't even have to go far to bury him properly. This tomb is roomy enough. *Laughs.*~
@115  = ~And Gallor can have his sarcophagus, if you are afraid of the stupid curses.~
@116  = ~Not bad, <CHARNAME>. I wish I got half that for every man I killed, but a man has to be a freak before he is worth anything. Figures.~
@117  = ~Ha-ha! This man dares to call himself the strongest in *my* presence?! Perhaps, I can keep him as a fool for a day or two, before cutting his throat.~
@118  = ~You and your girl stand no chance against me and my boy. He's the ugly one. Now, that we have been properly introduced, what are you waiting for, <CHARNAME>? Let's kill this scum.~
@119  = ~I was just thinking how refreshing it would be to kick some man in the groin. And break his skinny neck afterwards… Stop gawking, <CHARNAME>. There is coin to be made and fun to be had. On we go!~
@120  = ~You called me cowardly?! Big mistake, sister. I'd even say a lethal one! I was considering to help you against this lot for pure sport, but not any more.~
@121  = ~Then I shall brag that I've killed Death itself on the morrow!~
@122  = ~This woman asks for a taste of our steel, <CHARNAME>. Shall we give it to her, or will you act a coward and try to *spits* appease her?~
@123  = ~Bah, <CHARNAME>, the witless cow just gave you their numbers: three, and two of them are *men*. Pathetic. She's not worthy of that sweet blade she waves in front of your nose; I itch to take it for my own!~
@124  = ~Gutless worm! Slug! Coward! ... Man. *spits* ~
@125  = ~I have no liking whatsoever for dealing with the Fists. Have done, <CHARNAME>!~
@126  = ~All right! I *love* this household!~
@127  = ~Ha, this place is too drab. How about I redecorate it with your blood?!~
@128  = ~Even so, if you want him, you have to go through me!~
@129  = ~Yeah, well, gotta go!~
@130  = ~I'd take yer weight, ye great ox, but I don't know if ye've got that much gold.~
@131  = ~An' that's half a wit more than ye've got, but stow it, or we'll ne'er get goin'. And there's gold ahead enough for the lot of us, mayhap.~
@132  = ~Careful, lest your presence answer the question. Happily, <CHARNAME> has enough wit to recognize the advantage of bringing a Red Wizard along.~
@133  = ~Boo says I should not listen, so I will not. Lead on, <CHARNAME>!~
@134  = ~Fortunate, then, that my voice is not as shrill as yours. Let us be away from this dank place.~
@135  = ~I can look after meself well enough.~
@136  = ~Anyone can see the advantage of bringing along a man of my sophistication and talent.~
@137  = ~Tiax IS the model of mankind! Tiax rules all!~
@138  = ~Anytime ye like.~
@139  = ~Opinion noted, with distaste. Let us move on.~
@140  = ~I am above your scorn, barbarian.~
@141  = ~We'd be grateful for anything you can do. Berrun Ghastkill or Oublek can tell you more.~
@142  = ~If you want to rid us of him, I won't weep over it.~
@1001 = ~Yeah? Well bring it on!~
@1002 = ~Yep! Thanks!~
@1003 = ~Ah, stuff it.~
@1004 = ~*sigh*~
@1005 = ~Then stop yer gawkin' and start adventurin'! We've got a mine to flood!~
@1006 = ~Ha ha. Very droll. We will see who laughs last.~
@1007 = ~Tiax does not hear you! You are unworthy!~
@1008 = ~You got spirit, for a human!~
@1009 = ~You would be rewarded, but it's your choice.~
@1010 = ~You asked for it!~
@1011 = ~I've had about enough of this.~
@1012 = ~Too bad it's all just wishful thinking.~
@1013 = ~We see about that!~
@1014 = ~Do you really tolerate this insolence? Never mind. We go.~
@1015 = ~You all worthless rags!~
@1016 = ~Smart human! Cattack take gold and go.~
@1017 = ~All die, but you die first!~
@1018 = ~Er... farewell!~
@1019 = ~Draw steel!~
@1020 = ~Time to get back to business. Interested in a job?~

@144  = ~I've had enough of this.~
@145  = ~WAaaah!~
@149  = ~You'll get it, but don't come crying if it's all yours.~
@151  = ~You have done a valuable service, and it is my pleasure to reward you.~
@153  = ~Just let me go! Please!~
@155  = ~Sssssthh!~
