@0    = ~By Helm, the lies and the hides of these fiends reek of evil. Let us prepare for battle!~
@1    = ~Lady <CHARNAME> in the buff, on a bearskin rug - that's a charming thought...~
@2    = ~... thinking of you as a baby, of course, my lady. *blushes*~
@3    = ~My lady, if you want my opinion, you're still cute as a bug. And that was meant as a compliment.~
@4    = ~Of course, she's a baby...~
@5    = ~We will surely do that, my friend. Soon, those half-ogres won't be a threat any longer.~
@6    = ~Not yet, my friend, but I am sure <CHARNAME> will lead us there soon.~
@7    = ~We will seek for signs of your husband, my lady. I hope this will diminish your worries.~
@8    = ~'Killing any innocents that happen along his path'?! What kind of devil is that! We have to stop him!~
@9    = ~This must be the criminal Bassilus they mentioned in the temple! We must stop his evil deeds!~
@10   = ~What kind of devil is that?! We have to stop him!~
@11   = ~Now justice is done, and yet... it leaves a bad taste in the mouth.~
@12   = ~Your words show great wisdom, and hope is restored. Thank Helm we decided to bring this poor soul here.~
@13   = ~*Inclines his head to acknowledge his assent with Ajantis' words.*~
@14   = ~Thank you, my friend. May Helm be with you.~
@15   = ~Your call for help won't go unheard. We will do what we can to find the reasons for the evil occurrences in your mine!~
@16   = ~<CHARNAME>, don't let these scoundrels hurt this old mighty tree! It is the home of a dryad!~
@17   = ~<CHARNAME>, I am taken aback by your plan to help these scoundrels cut down this old mighty tree! It is the home of a dryad!~
@18   = ~*whispers* <CHARNAME>, do we have to play this game? There must be a honorable way to get into the bandit camp!~
@19   = ~Ye said somethin'?~
@20   = ~Strange as your attitude seems, my friend, I have the impression you are a capable fighter for good. Let us go, and help your lady out of her distress!~
@21   = ~By Helm! <CHARNAME>, can you not see that this is a fight of good against evil? I am not at your side in this! My honor tells me to defend this woman!~
@22   = ~<CHARNAME>, I hope you don't seriously consider carrying out this false plan?~
@23   = ~<CHARNAME>, I can't believe you are planning to participate in this deception!~
@24   = ~Your city is threatened by kobolds? I am sure solving this will be no problem for us... <CHARNAME>?~
@25   = ~I am glad you chose that course, <CHARNAME>. Gandolar, when we investigate the ruins, we will kill those kobolds for you.~
@26   = ~<CHARNAME>, I am disappointed by your rudeness to this halfling! He is the leader of this town, after all!~
@27   = ~You are bound to the will of the owner of your shawl?~
@28   = ~Yes, we will fight this ogre that suppresses you, beautiful creature. But we expect our companion to be restored to life, once we have succeeded!~
@29   = ~Now you see what comes from such needless lying, <CHARNAME>! We are forced to fight someone that could have been our friend!~
@30   = ~You showed a great sense of courage and honor, <CHARNAME>! The temptation of lying to receive a message addressed to our enemies did not overwhelm you.~
@31   = ~It was an honor to fight at your side, my friend. Farewell.~
@32   = ~<CHARNAME>, this drow is evil, and accused of murder. Protecting her means opposing the law!~
@33   = ~It is was the right choice not to ally with this evil creature, <CHARNAME>!~
@34   = ~*You* sentence us to death? Are you authorized to do this? Let us talk, there is no need for bloodshed.~
@35   = ~Fine words, drow, but be careful not to forget them. I will watch your steps carefully.~
@36   = ~Don't be afraid, miss. We will get him there as fast as possible.~
@37   = ~But I can't close my ears to such a misery! Do tell about the burden you are carrying, good man.~
@38   = ~<CHARNAME>, we have to talk to this poor man again and see whether we can help him. We can't leave him like this!~
@39   = ~We will be working for the *thieves guild*? <CHARNAME>, I have problems reconciling this with my duties as a paladin! But I will use this opportunity to have a closer look at what is going here. I surely hope the motivation for this cooperation is more than that of increasing your wealth through illegal activity.~
@40   = ~<CHARNAME>, this robbery is nothing but common thievery! I can't believe you accepted this inquiry!~
@41   = ~A paladin on the case? O, how naughty!~
@42   = ~<CHARNAME>, why did you turn that child away? He seemed in desperate need of help!~
@43   = ~<CHARNAME>, I am glad you changed your mind and decided to help that boy!~
@44   = ~Yes, show us the way. We will see what we can do to help you.~
@45   = ~To stand between two churches - the poor father! This was not an easy decision, <CHARNAME>, but I think we are doing the right thing. Let us find this child's body!~
@46   = ~<CHARNAME>, Umberlee is a cruel and evil deity, but her priestesses wouldn't harass fishermen without provocation. I have the feeling there is more to this story than we were told.~
@47   = ~Committing a crime by stealing! I can't believe this scum is asking passers-by to do his abominable deeds for him!~
@48   = ~Cruel murderer, you deserve your sentence! Get out of my sight!~
@49   = ~*cackles* Then you want to stay here?~
@50   = ~Be assured, murderer, if you ever happen to cross my way again, I will exact justice for those little souls you killed!~
@51   = ~Tiresome, bothersome... I wish I had met you fifteen years earlier, when you were little... oh, yes. How I wish.~
@52   = ~Duke Eltan, be assured that we will do all that is within our power to stop the foul play of these evil men, and prevent this needless and brutal war!~
@53   = ~Helm would be pleased to see you commiserate with the poor and needy, <CHARNAME>!~
@54   = ~Helm be with us! A henchman of our worst enemy in command of the Flaming Fist? There must be a way of disproving his position and rebutting the sentence he put on us!~
@55   = ~In this city, knight, it is my way or the gibbet.~
@56   = ~<CHARNAME>, you aren't seriously considering killing a person you've never met before, without even knowing the accusations against her, are you? Let us not raise weapons against this Dynaheir before we have heard the whole story!~
@57   = ~Fear no more, good woman! It will be an easy task for us to kill those worgs that are threatening your son!~
@58   = ~We will seek for signs of your friend, lad.~
@59   = ~Don't worry, dear woman. We will find that spellbook to save your daughter.~
@60   = ~<CHARNAME>, this is Drizzt Do'Urden, a well known honorable ranger! Don't be misled by his looks. If he is in need, we should help him defeat his attackers!~
@61   = ~By Helm! Now you reveal your true intentions! I am not at your side in this fight! <CHARNAME>, raise your weapon! My honor demands that I defend this elf!~
@62   = ~My good woman, sadness radiates from your face. Do tell me, what is the burden you carry on your shoulders? Has it something to do with the happenings in the mine?~
@63   = ~Such kind words from a stranger! Maybe you could... it is only, that... My husband works in the mines, and he hasn't come home for weeks now. Every day, there are men going missing down there, and I am very worried...~
@64   = ~Maybe we could help you. We are going to investigate the mines. Give us a description of your husband, maybe we'll see him down there.~
@65   = ~Sad. We have to go now.~
@66   = ~We will keep our eyes open for your husband, my lady.~
@67   = ~<CHARNAME>, why are you hiding the ring we found? This woman is in desperate need of news of her husband! Why keep her in suspense?~
@68   = ~Good lady, here is a ring that matches your description. We found it on a body... Please accept my condolences, good woman, for in all probability, your husband is dead.~
@69   = ~<CHARNAME>! How can you be so heartless! This ring is of so much more value to the widow than it could ever be to you. It belongs to her, strictly speaking!~
@70   = ~No! I have to finish my work! Ellesime!~
@71   = ~So shall it be. May the spirits of the forest haunt you.~
@72   = ~This man is talking about *killing* the archaeologist and all his helpers and *stealing* some magical item. Get you gone, rascal!~
@73   = ~Hey, I was talking to *<HIMHER>*, or is it you who makes the decisions?~
@74   = ~<CHARNAME> is our leader, but I am a paladin, in the name of Helm, and I won't tolerate such a treachery!~
@75   = ~Ajantis is absolutely right. We will do no such thing as you intended!~
@76   = ~Er.. Ajantis? I would like to listen to what this man is actually suggesting.~
@77   = ~Ajantis, keep your mouth shut! *I* make the decisions, all right? I think this man has a very interesting proposal and I would like to hear it.~
@78   = ~Ah, no, no - forget it. I don't think you are of much help in this case. Damn! Well, I will find someone else who'll help me succeed. You'd better be gone!~
@79   = ~You scoundrels won't have a chance to cut down this mighty tree - the home of a dryad! If respect for the fairy folk will not stop you from performing this evil act, then we must protect this forest spirit! Defend yourself!~
@80   = ~What an insidious person! I am very glad you turned him away, <CHARNAME>! Maybe we should warn this Duke of Baldur's Gate, before this scoundrel finds other helpers for his base plan.~
@81   = ~What a relief to know that all these poor souls will have a chance to escape! Let us move on, and clarify what is going on in this mine.~
@82   = ~Now they show their true faces! I second your decision not to cooperate with these people. Let us fight these criminals, we are doing the city a favour by cleaning this den of thieves!~
@83   = ~Illegal! <CHARNAME>, we are here to put an end to the bandit activities threatening the Sword Coast. You are not seriously going to listen to what this man has to offer on illegal actions? The only appropriate reaction to his words would be calling the town guards!~
@84   = ~Please, don't, sir...~
@85   = ~<CHARNAME>, I am glad you turned that man down. He seemed to be a villain, like so many we met on our travels.~
@86   = ~Villain, me? Oi...~
@87   = ~At least we could bring you the news of his death and his wedding ring as keepsake, even if this might be of little consolation to you now. Be assured of my deepest feelings of sorrow and grief, my lady.~
@88   = ~<CHARNAME>, I am very glad you took the time to return the ring to this poor widow. At least now she knows the sad truth.~
@89   = ~What a ridiculous threat! We are not the helpless merchants you might otherwise encounter here! In fact, we are strong enough to end your condemnable existence!~
@90   = ~Well decided, <CHARNAME>! Now this scum will be treated the way they deserve!~
@91   = ~<CHARNAME>, why did you give in to those bandits! We've fought far more dangerous adversaries. I am sure we could have beaten those villains. Now they are gone, threatening other travellers - with our treasure!~
@92   = ~This sounds serious, <CHARNAME>! If the second in command of the Flaming Fist is asking for help from 'passers-by', as we might seem, we should listen!~
@93   = ~We should accomplish our plan and quickly return to Scar, so we might be led to the Grand Duke Eltan! This meeting seems to be important for our own search, too!~
@94   = ~<CHARNAME>, why did you turn that man down? This seemed to be a serious plea!~
@95   = ~We will scan this appalling forest for signs of your brother, lad!~
@96   = ~By Helm, <CHARNAME>, if this Chelak is really the inexperienced young man I imagine him to be, I don't think he had a chance. Yet I hope my words will be proven wrong, so let us go quickly!~
@97   = ~That was an honorable deed, <CHARNAME>! The money will help Farmer Brun maintain his farm without his son.~
@98   = ~And very clever of you, too! Pretending that we do *not* mean to give money to him was the only way to make this proud man accept the donation!~
@99   = ~Hm. What a proud old man! I am deeply impressed. But he won't be able to cope without aid. Maybe there is a better way of offering it to him, <CHARNAME>!~
@100  = ~<CHARNAME>, your actions are in the true spirit of honor and righteousness! I am exulted to be in this group and to fight at your side!~ [%tutu_var%AJANT04]
@101  = ~By Helm! Now you reveal your true intentions! I am not at your side in this fight! <CHARNAME>, raise your weapon! My honor demands that I defend this honorable drow!~
@102  = ~<CHARNAME>, this must be Joseph's wedding ring. Poor fellow, he must have fallen victim to the evil afflicting these mines. Let us bring this ring to his widow, once we are back. The least we can do for her is to bring her certainty about his fate.~
@103  = ~Wait a moment! Of course we will give you the money you need to save all these pour souls! Take it, and get yourself and the others out of here as soon as possible!~
@104  = ~Wait, wondrous forest spirit, don't go away. <CHARNAME>, I can't agree with your decision to let this plea for help go unheard. Protecting the tree of this dryad won't cost us much effort, but will save the life of an ancient forest creature.~
@105  = ~OK, OK, now that my companions make the decisions for me... I'll help you. Show the way!~
@106  = ~Ajantis, we don't have time for things like this. I said ‘no’, and that decision is final.~
@107  = ~Keep your money to yourself, dear man. <CHARNAME> was joking, I guess. There is no man called Greywolf in this group.~
@108  = ~There is no need for your curses, my good man. I am sure <CHARNAME> will agree that we have enough time to wait a little while. If it means so much to you, we will let you finish your work.~
@109  = ~*sigh* All right then, go on.~
@110  = ~No! I said we will take him along *now*, and that's what we'll do!~
@111  = ~<CHARNAME>, this looks like a special dagger. Maybe it belonged to that little gnome who was killed by ankhegs.~
@112  = ~<CHARNAME>, after all that has happened here, you are taking the artifact with you? Kozah was a very powerful god of chaos and destruction, nothing good will arise from this!~
@113  = ~Betrayal! We have to protect Duke Belt and Duchess Liia at all costs!~
@114  = ~<CHARNAME>, this is the child of the young Maralee. I can't believe these creatures abducted a small infant such as this! He is in good health, but we should bring him back to his mother as soon as possible!~
@115  = ~So, here we are at the thieves guild! What a place of lawlessness and treachery! I advise you to watch out, <CHARNAME>, and I expect us to leave as soon as possible!~
@116  = ~Thanks for the warning, Ajantis. I don't feel very comfortable here, myself.~
@117  = ~I came here because I got... invited. Let us have a look around, Ajantis.~
@118  = ~Ajantis, you are generalizing. Not all thieves are bad people. You should judge people on their deeds, not on their chosen profession. If there were no thieves, who would disarm the traps that could harm us? Who would pick the locks to free the next slaves we find?~
@119  = ~I agree with your words, <CHARNAME>, and I respect a person having that profession and choosing the right path. Yet such a person is in the minority. This guild is an alliance of heartless, power seeking thieves without morals, earning their living by performing illegal actions.~
@120  = ~This seems to be the son of that old farmer. Poor soul! The ankhegs must have brought him here.~
@121  = ~<CHARNAME>, this Samuel is getting sicker and sicker. I don't know how much longer he will survive. We have to get him to the Temple of Wisdom in the Friendly Arm Inn right away, or he'll die.~
@122  = ~This seems to be a letter from Mirianne's husband! We should give it to her as soon as possible!~
@123  = ~<CHARNAME>, I can't agree to where you are leading us! We are not following the path of goodness and righteousness!~ [%tutu_var%AJANT06]
@124  = ~Ajantis, I don't like that myself, but it is only a temporary thing. It will change soon.~
@125  = ~Ajantis, calm down! It is not that bad! Keep in mind that we are doing this for the high goals we are aiming at!~
@126  = ~I am relieved to hear this. Let us move on and make your words come true by our actions!~
@127  = ~High goals don't excuse everything. From now on, make sure we proceed on the right path!~
@128  = ~Watch out, <CHARNAME>, we are now in the area the paladin Bjornin mentioned. We should keep our eyes open for those ogres he was talking about!~
@129  = ~Well done, <CHARNAME>, that was the last of those ogres. We should go back to Beregost and tell Bjornin that his injuries have been avenged.~
@130  = ~Now we are here at the famous Candlekeep library! All this wisdom and knowledge condensed in these halls!~
@131  = ~But we are not here for knowledge. Alas! It is the presence of shameless criminals that brings us here. Let us find them and clean these mighty halls of their evil presence!~
@132  = ~<CHARNAME>, you... you are an offspring of *Bhaal*, the God of Murder?!~
@133  = ~I didn't know that myself, Ajantis!~
@134  = ~So it seems, indeed.~
@135  = ~You say this as if this information didn't move you at all! Did you know that already?~
@136  = ~No, I just found out now, Ajantis.~
@137  = ~Why is this of interest to you, Ajantis?~
@138  = ~You didn't know that yourself... Yes, I believe you. What a perplexing discovery! What a heritage you are carrying!~
@139  = ~Well, I guess I have to believe you. What a perplexing discovery! What a heritage you are carrying!~
@140  = ~Answer my questions honestly. What does this mean to you? How will you treat this heritage?~
@141  = ~I loathe being an offspring of Bhaal! Evil won't have a chance on me. I will do all that is in my power not to carry on what my father left behind!~
@142  = ~I don't know... It is all happening so fast. I don't want to be involved in this! Best if this were a great misunderstanding!~
@143  = ~Hm... I have to think about it. This actually provides some very interesting new possibilities...~
@144  = ~I am a god's child, Ajantis. I can sense the power that's in me! I have to use it. Anything else would be wrong!~
@145  = ~Why this is of interest to me?! I am a paladin of Helm, and you... an offspring of Bhaal! I have to know how you will deal with your heritage!~
@146  = ~Why this is of interest to me?! My love, I am a paladin of Helm, and you... an offspring of Bhaal! I... *have* to know how you will deal with your heritage!~
@147  = ~I am very relieved and happy to hear that.~
@148  = ~Great words, but I doubt you will have the steadiness and willpower to make them come true.~
@149  = ~It seems to be real, so you have to deal with it! Trying to hide from your godly heritage won't work, it will only leave you unprepared in times of need!~
@150  = ~Possibilities?! Do you seriously consider using the powers of your bloody father for your own aims?~
@151  = ~No, I didn't mean it like that. It was only a general thought.~
@152  = ~Indeed! I am a god's child, Ajantis. I can sense the power that's in me! I have to use it. Anything else would be wrong!~
@153  = ~What are you talking about?! Bhaal was the deity of murder and destruction! Do you want those evil powers to become *yours*?~
@154  = ~Sure! A lot of unexpected possibilities are coming my way... The more I think of it, the more I like the idea!~
@155  = ~Do I have a choice? You know Alaundo's prophecies. I have to be the last, otherwise I will fall by the hand of one of my brothers or sisters.~
@156  = ~Not the *evil* forces, Ajantis. All I am talking about is the godly powers I hold in me. I will use them for my own purposes!~
@157  = ~You know Alaundo's prophecies. The offspring of Bhaal will fight each other for the throne of their father, bringing chaos and destruction to all around them. Where will you be when this happens, <CHARNAME>?~
@158  = ~You base your words on mortal translations of the prophecies. I am sure some of his offspring will fight for the throne, but I refuse to take an evil path simply because some... deity decided to impregnate my mother. And I will be wherever I need to be, in order to destroy it... before it can destroy me.~
@159  = ~I just can't accept this as my destiny! I don't want to fight for the throne of Bhaal, I don't want to spread chaos and destruction! I will remain true to my path, trying to do good!~
@160  = ~Well, if this is the will of the gods, I fear it will happen that way.~
@161  = ~I have to fight this fight! It is the only way I will get my father's heritage, which belongs to me!~
@162  = ~Are you that naive, to think you could trick the true nature of your father, and use his powers to do *good*?!~
@163  = ~Why should this be impossible? I am not evil, Ajantis. If it is my destiny to take my father's place - why not do it *my* way?~
@164  = ~Who is talking about doing good, Ajantis?... Once I have the powers, I'll do whatever *I* want!~
@165  = ~I can't believe you are saying this. Stay away from me! I will stay with you, but only to watch your steps. Helm, in his holy might, will help me fight you, if this should become necessary!~
@166  = ~What... what are you saying, my love! Please, tell me that you don't mean it... yet, you meant it seriously. Should I be so mistaken about you...~
@167  = ~Stay away from me, my lady! I have knightly duties to fulfill! I will stay with you, but only to watch your steps. Helm, in his holy might, will help me fight you, if this should become necessary!~
@168  = ~So, you are going to kill your brothers and sisters? You are going to spill their blood and other's over the soil of your country?~
@169  = ~I didn't say it is my *will*! All I am doing is accepting my destiny. If this is what the gods hold for me, I will play their game.~
@170  = ~Indeed! I won't sit and wait until my power-seeking half-brothers and sisters pass by, trying to get nearer to our father's throne by killing me!~
@171  = ~I will wade through their blood, and I will smile about it, Ajantis!~
@172  = ~Because we mortals aren't born to have and *control* such powers, <CHARNAME>! Bhaal himself was a mortal, but he was wicked and power-hungry, and so were the godly powers he received. What you are talking about is to use and form these evil powers for your own, not evil purposes! How do you know you will be strong enough for that?~
@173  = ~I don't know it, Ajantis, but I will do all that is in my power to make it come true.~
@174  = ~Of course I'll be strong enough! Haven't I already choosen the path of goodness, despite my heritage?~
@175  = ~Ah, poppycock! Time will tell. Why are you worried about it now?~
@176  = ~I can't believe you are treating this so lightly! Get rational, <CHARNAME>! This is the power of a deity you are facing. It will form *you*, not the other way round. You have to be firm in faith, steady without the smallest hesitation on the path of goodness and righteousness, and then there might be a chance to succeed!~
@177  = ~Well, you seem to have stayed on the right path up to now... I see a chance for you to reach your goal.~
@178  = ~You will fail, <CHARNAME>. You have already performed evil deeds on our travels. You are not on the right path, and your willpower isn't strong enough! The evil powers will overwhelm you!~
@179  = ~You are definitely on the path of righteousness, and I see a chance for you to reach your goal.~
@180  = ~But how will you succeed? You know Alaundo's prophecies. The offspring of Bhaal will fight each other for the throne of their father, bringing chaos and destruction to all around them. Where will you be when this happens, <CHARNAME>?~
@181  = ~I will stay with you... but only to watch your steps! Helm, in his holy might, will give me strength to fight you, if this should become necessary!~
@182  = ~Forgive me, my love. I must end our relationship to be able to concentrate on my duties as a paladin. I will stay with you... but only to watch your steps! Helm, in his holy might, will give me strength to fight you, if this should become necessary!~
@183  = ~Your words let my doubts disappear. Let us move on, and be vigilant. I will fight at your side and assist you in your magnanimous plan as much as I can.~
@184  = ~You choose great words, but they can't make my doubts disappear. I will fight at your side and assist you in your magnanimous plan, as long as you stay on the right path.~
@185  = ~You choose great words, my love, but they don't fit to your deeds so far. I was hoping I could overlook it, but the situation has changed...~
@186  = ~Forgive me, my love. I must end our relationship to be able to concentrate on my duties as a paladin. I will stay with you... but only to watch your steps! I will fight at your side and assist you in your magnanimous plan, as long as you stay on the right path.~
@187  = ~I see. Let us move on and be vigilant. I will fight at your side and assist you, as long as you stay on the right path.~
@188  = ~My love, your words let my doubts disappear. I am... very happy, because it means I can stay with you without having to neglect my duties as a paladin...~
@189  = ~Yet I tremble at the thought of what might be waiting for you in the future. Let us move on and be vigilant. I will support you with all my might!~
@190  = ~Don't accept destiny as a given! It is not yet decided *how* things will happen. You can influence the path your future will take with your good powers! As a paladin I have to know how you will decide, once that day comes.~
@191  = ~Ajantis, I will try to stay on the path of goodness, no matter what the future will bring. Please, believe me!~
@192  = ~When the day comes, I will do whatever destiny has prepared for me. If it means I have to kill other Bhaal offspring, then so be it.~
@193  = ~That means you *will* actively participate in making the prophecy come true...~
@194  = ~The readiness apparent in your words frightens me, my love. And yet you would have the power to stay on the path of good...~
@195  = ~I tremble at the thought of what might be waiting for you in the future. Let us move on and be vigilant. I will assist you, as long as you stay on the right path.~
@196  = ~The readiness apparent in your words frightens me. And yet you would have the power to stay on the path of good...~
@197  = ~Let us move on and be vigilant. I will fight at your side and assist you, as long as you stay on the right path.~
@198  = ~My heart is saddened considering this, my love. You have already performed evil deeds on our travels. I was hoping I could overlook it, but the situation has changed...~
@199  = ~My heart is saddened when considering this. You have already performed evil deeds on our travels... I must concentrate on my duties as a paladin. I will keep my thoughts to myself, from now on.~
@200  = ~Let us move on and be vigilant, my lady. I will fight at your side and assist you, as long as you stay on the right path.~
@201  = ~You evil creature! Now you reveal your true intentions! Raise your weapon, I won't let you go any further!~ [%tutu_var%AJANT31]
@202  = ~<CHARNAME>, I will follow you despite the reputation you have at the moment. Time will tell whether your deeds turn out to be better than the impression you are making right now. I expect us to stay on the path of goodness and righteousness as we proceed. Let us go and chase those bandits that plague the roads!~
@203  = ~<CHARNAME>, I see that we are on the right path now. What you just did was a very good deed. Let us move on and keep up this spirit!~ [%tutu_var%AJANT04]
@204  = ~<CHARNAME>, I am very content with our actions so far, and I think you are a very good leader. Our deeds show the spirit of goodness and righteousness! I thank Helm we combined our forces. Let us go and carry on, there are still a lot of evil creatures waiting on our way.~ [%tutu_var%AJANT04]
@205  = ~What is this?! This is a 'wanted' description of you, <CHARNAME>. An evil enemy wants you dead, so it seems! Let us carry on with our search and not be discouraged by such developments. We are on the right path, and this enemy will be defeated in the end.~
@206  = ~And here we have this Chelak, poor fellow. All we can do for him and his family is to return the body to his brother. Another grieving mother! I surely wished it could have been a happier ending.~
@207  = ~By Helm! Now you reveal your true intentions! I am not on your side in this fight! <CHARNAME>, raise your weapons! My honor demands that I defend this valiant drow!~
@208  = ~So, these are the Undercellars of Baldur's Gate. Ah, this place stinks of crime and oppression.~
@209  = ~This is nowhere a paladin should spend his time. <CHARNAME>, I expect us to leave this place immediately!~
@210  = ~This is nowhere a paladin should spend his time. <CHARNAME>, I expect us to seek the person we are here for and then leave this place immediately!~
@211  = ~Would that the evil-doers had enough decency to come out of the bowels and sewers, to face us squarely on the battle-field! But no, they prefer to dig themselves into filth, and they seek sanctuary in the hovels of disreputable women, not temples! No doubt, they hope that those of the nobler disposition would not want to stain their honor by associating with such, and would not follow.~
@212  = ~Knightly honor is a strange thing... You feel dishonored when these hard-working maidens offer their simple charms to you in exchange for hard coin. Yet, you press your attentions on <CHARNAME>, for free and freely, expecting her to be honored by it...~
@213  = ~*reddens* That is something totaly different, elf, and I don't know what that remark was for. Better watch out lest you lose your honor yourself - or even smudge <CHARNAME>'s!~
@214  = ~What happened to you, <CHARNAME>. Your mind will get twisted by this evil device...~
@215  = ~We will see whether for good or for bad. I will watch your steps closely, until you get that helmet removed from your head.~
@216  = ~What... what happened to me! My mind... was twisted, my thoughts were evil!~
@217  = ~You were wearing a helmet that turned you evil, Ajantis. It is removed now.~
@218  = ~Thank goodness you have that thing off again. I prefer you the way you are.~
@219  = ~What is the problem? We had a bit fun, you and me, slaughtering innocents in the name of Helm.~
@220  = ~Don't try to fool me! You made me betray my beliefs!~
@221  = ~Ajantis, I swear, I wasn't aware of the consequences that arise from wearing this helmet.~
@222  = ~I am truly sorry, Ajantis. It won't happen again.~
@223  = ~What is the problem? I just helped you to get rid of that thing!~
@224  = ~Whatever! Stay away with this evil device. It shall not bend my mind again!~
@225  = ~You... you think I can serve our purpose in this state better? I demand this belt be taken off me as soon as possible!~
@226  = ~You'll have to get through me first!~
@227  = ~I do not care for your tone, sir!~
@228  = ~Forgive me, then. I am looking for someone.~
@229  = ~Then prepare to die for your greed!~
@230  = ~May the gods reward your arrogance with death!~
@231  = ~You have done a valuable service to this town for bringing this criminal to justice.~
@1001 = ~And also with you.~
@1002 = ~Onward, my armor-plated friend!~
@234  = ~I thank thee, champion of righteousness!~
@1003 = ~Think of it as "rescuing" a maiden, my good man!~
@1004 = ~It takes all kinds, I suppose. Could have done with one a bit more helpful, but that's the way of things.~
@1005 = ~He will, if you kill the ogre.~
@1006 = ~You can't lie to Nature!~
@239  = ~And here is your reward.~
@1007 = ~Helm go with you.~
@1008 = ~I'm authorized to do this if I *say* I'm authorized to do this! Now prepare to fight!~
@1009 = ~I bet you will, jaluk!~
@1010 = ~Thank you!~
@1011 = ~You've done all I could ask of you, bringing me his body. You can't help it if I'm a poor old farmer.~
@1012 = ~I am, too!~
@1013 = ~Thank you. If you succeed, Baldur's Gate will be in your debt.~
@1014 = ~What was that? Plotting already? Go along peacefully, and no one gets hurt.~
@1015 = ~The "story" is that she is a Rashemi witch! Anything else would surely overwhelm your tiny little minds.~
@1016 = ~Thank you, my valiant comrade.~
@1017 = ~Har har! We fight!~
@251  = ~Thanks again! And good luck!~
@1018 = ~Or cleansing it of yourselves! Draw steel!~
@1019 = ~Heh. Your loss!~
@1020 = ~Stupid decision, if you ask me!~
@1021 = ~It was. I'll have to go find someone else to help me.~
@256  = ~I'm not needing any of your charity. You've done all you can. My money troubles are not your concern.~
