@1    = ~... thinking of you as a baby, of course, my lady. *blushes*~
@2    = ~My lady, if you want my opinion, you're still cute as a bug. And that was meant as a compliment.~
@3    = ~Of course, she's a baby...~
@4    = ~Our prim and proper <CHARNAME> on a bearskin rug. A thought I will not forget anytime soon.~
@5    = ~Ah, <PRO_HESHE> is still a cutie!~
@6    = ~I must say, this is the most inspiring tale I have heard about <CHARNAME> to date.~
@7    = ~Aye, little one...~
@8    = ~<CHARNAME> in the buff, on a bearskin rug... Even with the look she is giving me now, which forebodes my imminent death, it is still a tantalizing thought.~
@9    = ~Ah, the carefree youth, how I envy you...~
@10   = ~Sweet, innocent little <CHARNAME>, in the buff, on a bearskin rug. Imagine that, Boo!~
@11   = ~Some of us already have.~
@12   = ~Coran, will you stop that mumbling!~
@13   = ~Stop encouraging him!~
@14   = ~Ah, those were the times...~
@15   = ~What's so funny about that? Minsc used to do that all the time, until Boo explained to him that the sight of a naked Minsc is too much for some people. Actually Boo said it caused "phallic jealousy", but Boo uses hard to understand words all the time, so Minsc has to translate...~
@16   = ~Minsc, thou shalt not utter another word! I refuse, even, to remember those times! We wert chased out of three towns in less than a tenday!~
@17   = ~Yes, but Minsc also got twelve marriage proposals.~
@18   = ~A refreshing outlook...~
@19   = ~So utterly naive... and not quite so bad looking... (A deadly combination indeed. For a simian, that is.)~
@20   = ~Beg your pardon, sir, but there is nothing evil 'bout this littl' cherry.~
@21   = ~Well, not too much has changed, then. Now she just waits until we make camp, before she gets away from the rest of the party and... Ah... uhmm... forget I said that.~
@22   = ~I heard that, Garrick. Watch your tongue while talking of the fairer gender, especially lady <CHARNAME>!~
@23   = ~Aha, so your little friends here noticed it, too?~
@24   = ~Seems you were born with the talent, then... But you must learn to control this desire of yours to steal men's clothing. Tee-hee!~
@25   = ~Don't tell her that... She might actually listen to you.~
@26   = ~She never listens about it... but she is such a dear...~
@27   = ~Who did not see this one coming from a mile away? Now the boys'll be bantering for days... yup!~
@28   = ~Ah, you are here, too? Well, you were the quiet one of the pair, you were...~
@29   = ~*snicker* I cannot remember ever laughing so hard... little <CHARNAME> and <PRO_HISHER> bearskin rug... I simply must see how our omnipotent authority figure looked, cute as a bug...~
@30   = ~P-perhaps in exchange I c-could allow <CHARNAME> to take a look at some of the paintings p-portraying you, my d-dear... especially the one I always c-carry with me.~
@31   = ~*blush* What... what painting, Khalid? I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about, and I suggest we drop this nonsense now. We have more important things to do.~
@32   = ~*snicker* <CHARNAME>, you owe me for t-this one...~
@33   = ~Farewell, <CHARNAME>!~
@34   = ~Now justice is done, and yet... it leaves a bad taste in the mouth.~
@35   = ~<CHARNAME>, I am not pleased with thy handling of this matter. This poor man was cursed, and his torment upon his recovery was genuine. Thou should have found a just and merciful man to surrender him to.~
@36   = ~You've surrendered him to lawful justice. The people of this town will sleep easier knowing he's no longer a threat.~
@37   = ~By Helm! <CHARNAME>, can you not see that this is a fight of good against evil? I am not at your side in this! My honor tells me to defend this woman!~
@38   = ~I thank thee, champion of righteousness!~
@39   = ~I will not stand idly, let alone help you to finish off what gnolls have started by torturing this innocent woman! Lady Dynaheir, it is my pleasure to offer you my assistance against these... bandits.~
@40   = ~I thank thy noble heart and generous spirit!~
@41   = ~You showed a great sense of courage and honor, <CHARNAME>! The temptation of lying to receive a message addressed to our enemies did not overwhelm you.~
@42   = ~So, thou style thyself an enemy of the Iron Throne openly now? Well, one cannot hide all in a sack, I suppose, so mayhap 'tis for the best.~
@43   = ~Hmph. An offering from one of those filthy Shadow Druids. I am amazed he did not attack us on sight. Still, <CHARNAME>... I would not trust those detestable brews of theirs, that potion should be disposed of instead of consumed.~
@44   = ~Your companion professed <PRO_HISHER> friendship. Do not test my tolerance.~
@45   = ~Farewell.~
@46   = ~What a relief to know that all these poor souls will have a chance to escape! Let us move on, and clarify what is going on in this mine.~
@47   = ~Wow, <CHARNAME>, we're freeing the slaves, just like heroes in the songs!~
@48   = ~Thanks again! And good luck!~
@49   = ~*whispering* I, err... I don't think it is such a good idea...~
@50   = ~I like not the looks of this, <CHARNAME>. This one has a furtive manner, and I trust not the suspicious set of his face. He would not be so cautious 'less he had something to hide from Tempus' sight.~
@51   = ~ Don't ya be standin' there all day! Come on!~
@53   = ~(Fishermen ask me to help them to go out to sea... next, the farmers will plead for me to help them to sow. I am becoming truly indispensable to the agriculture of this region.) Please, <CHARNAME>, just say... NO!~
@52   = ~Sea Wolf venerates Umberlee, <CHARNAME>. She rules the waves and sea winds from her flooded layer of the Abyss. She is worshipped out of fear, not adoration. Mariners throw gold and gems into the ocean when caught by the storms in hopes to appease the Bitch Queen. Her followers are as violent as their patron. It will be a good battle, <CHARNAME>, but if you ever plan to sail the seas... I know that you can fight men, but could you fight the tall waves?~
@54   = ~The Bitch Queen? Her clergy are most certainly evil and terrible people.~
@55   = ~Damn straight. So, will ye help us?~
@56   = ~The three of you cannot win favor with one lady? Me, I alone can win three ladies in the same amount of time!~
@57   = ~You try it then, mate. Only she's no lady, she's a bitch, like her Queen...~
@58   = ~<CHARNAME>, men who call a woman a bitch are not worthy of our help...~
@59   = ~Aye, she's got a fierce reputation, but we need your help. Will you help us?~
@60   = ~Aghh! Will you shut this moron up, already! What does a girl have ta do to get some peace and quiet around here!~
@61   = ~If only that one were gifted to wield a blade half as well as he wields his tongue, he'd be truly a wondrous creature.~
@62   = ~Aye, I wish that too sometimes. Then I could be an adventurer.~
@63   = ~Bye!~
@64   = ~Au contraire, there is plenty of time. I would say, about fifteen years until the boy matures without interference from his empty-headed squawking mother. If I were him, I would have chosen worgs' company over yours, as well.~
@65   = ~Poor lad. I think we should go help him. It reminds me of when we were kids in Candlekeep, and you'd run away scared of the dogs, when they'd bark.~
@66   = ~Honestly, cannot you people take care of yourselves? Has the brat not been taught to hold a sword, at least? This display of abject cowardice against mere worgs is pathetic.~
@67   = ~<CHARNAME>, if we do errands for every old lady along the way, then even I shall die of old age, having accomplished naught but tasks better suited to slaves!~
@68   = ~Have you no heart, dark witch? Tis my child trapped there!~
@69   = ~Oh, I have a heart. But it beats only for me, and not for those too feeble to take care of themselves. Come, <CHARNAME>, I no longer wish to speak to this wretch.~
@70   = ~On my honor as a ranger I swear that we will do our best to draw away the worgs, my good woman.~
@71    = ~Darling, you are not going to drag me through the thicket to rescue this brat, are you? I shudder to think what it can do to my skin...~
@72   = ~Fear no more, good woman! It will be an easy task for us to kill those worgs that are threatening your son!~
@73   = ~Oh, please help him!~
@74  = ~Foolish indeed. The death of the weak is to be encouraged; this natural selection is what has made my people so superior.~
@75   = ~'Tis a valiant deed these two have attempted, though all for naught 'less we grant them aid. I respect their forthrightness; let us lend them our strength.~
@76   = ~I am grieved, for I foresee that 'tis as thou fear: the spiders do not keep prisoners. Yet, I myself was a captive of no less vicious critters and survived a while before <CHARNAME> came to the rescue.~
@77  = ~Poor defenseless boy, lost in these woods! We must find him, <CHARNAME>, we must!~
@78   = ~Please. What say you, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@79   = ~Well, I am kinda bored...~
@80   = ~My lucky day, then. I got someone who's bored AND foolish.~
@81   = ~Hmmph.~
@82   = ~*sighs* At least we are likely to get a gravestone monument out of this one, in addition to the grave itself...~
@83   = ~A basilisk! Stonegazers, slayers with sight... I have known what it is like to be stone, and greatly desire to take vengeance for the memory out of the hide of this creature!~
@84   = ~Bored, foolish and have a score t' settle. You qualify.~
@85   = ~Now, get in there and kill the critter already!~
@86   = ~Give up all our iron?! I would sooner give up my maidenhead first!~
@87   = ~Ah, look. More typical surface scum out to play. It is a strain to listen to their dull-witted tongues.~
@88   = ~Your iron and your life!~
@89   = ~Infant wyverns? Pathetic. I'd rather find an enemy more worthy of gutting, but as Tempus wills it.~
@90   = ~*laughs unkindly* Nobody laughs at my students!~
@91   = ~You enslave poor, innocent, little wyverns?! Minsc shall have to take the boot to your vile deeds, yes sir!~
@92   = ~Not bad boots... Hmm, I wonder if my trainees would leave them, after they are done eating your corpse?~
@93   = ~Enough of this!~
@94   = ~In truth, that mageling is too rude for my liking. I'm tempted to teach him how to be more mannerly and hospitable. But Tempus forgive me, what is the point in challenging someone so obviously weak?~
@95   = ~I hoped for a warmer welcome for my company, Thalantyr. You once offered me your roof, or have you forgotten?~
@96   = ~Elf! The name was Kivan, if I am not mistaken. Bah! That's a proper treatment for you, if you stand in the corner with your cowl covering your face. But I never thanked you properly... Come, come, I'll show you what I have done with the spear you broke on these bothersome bandits who tried to force their way in. I am quite happy with the way the enchantment has turned out. I do not craft weapons, mind you. Bah! It's a gift. Take it, take it, elf.~
@97   = ~Now, if you've nothing to trade, be off with you!~
@98   = ~Yes, suddenly becoming a common thief is indeed "too much fun". Having the Flaming Fist list us as wanted criminals for this burglary, while we are attempting to investigate the situation in the city, will be even more fun, will it not? How did I ever end up with one such as you, <CHARNAME>?~
@99   = ~You must lead an exciting life, madam.~
@100  = ~Are we to be hired by this foul-smelling, weaselly little man to attempt petty theft?! Come now, this is beneath all of us!~
@101  = ~Excuse me, miss, but I have bathed only yestereve, and I am quite confident that you did not.~
@102  = ~Are we to be hired by this foul-smelling, weaselly little man to attempt petty theft?! Come now, this is beneath all of us! Even Xan.~
@103  = ~Are we to be hired by this foul-smelling, weaselly little man to attempt petty theft?! Come now, this is beneath all of us! Even Montaron.~
@104  = ~Are we to be hired by this foul-smelling, weaselly little man to attempt petty theft?! Come now, this is beneath all of us! Even Viconia.~
@105  = ~<CHARNAME>, this robbery is nothing but common thievery! I can't believe you accepted this inquiry!~
@106  = ~A paladin on the case? O, how naughty!~
@107  = ~Great! A chance for me to show you what I can do!~
@108  = ~Yes, yes, indeed, lady. Will you take the job?~
@109  = ~Oh, this is just so exciting!~
@110  = ~*spits* I, for one, have no desire to prove myself a gentle MAN! I'm one tough woman, and if you won't shut up and fight, I'll push your manners down your throat with my boots!~
@111  = ~I doubt not that you are ill-mannered enough to act upon your threat, but I assure you that I have taken every precaution to protect myself against brutes like you.~
@112  = ~A thief does not set rules for another thief... gentleman, or not. We will do what pleases us, and if you do not like it – well, here is your chance to make yet another attempt on <CHARNAME>'s life. All previous assailants have fallen to <PRO_HISHER> hand.~
@113  = ~It would be a sad day indeed, if I took some pointy-eared rogue's threats seriously.~
@114  = ~Ah, what a pity... I was hoping to see the amulet decorating that beautiful neck of yours, lady... ~
@115  = ~Get lost, already!~
@116  = ~I shall not leave without teaching you two lessons: firstly, do not hire a Red Wizard of Thay for such petty tasks, and secondly - if you made the huge mistake of doing so, you should never call him a fool afterwards.~
@117  = ~Committing a crime by stealing! I can't believe this scum is asking passers-by to do his abominable deeds for him!~
@118  = ~I'll be damned if I'll be running small errands for a dwarf! Wait... you said the reward would be handsome? Can you give an exact number?~
@119  = ~If I like your work, and you do it fast, there'd be 200 gold in it fer you.~
@120  = ~From what I've heard, the items from this place will probably kill you!~
@121  = ~Those are completely unfounded accusations! Why, that boy only suffered minor burns, and I'm sure her ladyship's scars will heal, in time...~
@122  = ~For the sake of her lord husband, I hope they do...~
@123  = ~Your pickled brain, if you please, and a thousand gold, as a reward for removing the worst merchandise in your store for you.~
@124  = ~I swear, sir, it is not quite as bad as it er... appears.~
@125  = ~Uhm... you are indeed lucky, if you are still alive among the stuff you sell. Look at this bottle! It has burned an inch deep hole around itself on a shelf! And this... er, whatever it is... I swear it winked at me!~
@126  = ~That? That's eyes of some lady lich... or, at least, the gnome who sold it to me claimed that 'twas...~
@127  = ~So, what can I do for you?~
@128    = ~Darling, you forgot the cardinal rule: always make sure you have more on him than he has on you.~
@129   = ~Who would believe rumors, once they looked into your beautiful innocent eyes, m'lady?~
@130   = ~This is... not a light matter... I need him silenced! Please...~
@131   = ~I know not the man, but seeking to capitalize on the misfortune of another surely is despicable. However, the means which this woman is ready to put to use suggest that she is equally wicked. Truth be told, they both disgust me, and I propose we leave them to settle their problems without our interference.~
@132   = ~Please... help me.~
@133   = ~Comely only by magic; for I know no creature in nature is more beautiful than the drow. I have no qualms disposing of these creatures, though I don't see why we should make the effort. Still, as usual, I suspect our actions won't be entirely my decision...~
@134  = ~<CHARNAME>, it will surely break my heart to kill these beautiful, innocent creatures... (That should be enough to dissuade <PRO_HIMHER>; all the two-penny heroes are forever fools for gooey whining of the sort... and supplying exotic concubines is a profitable business. All that is needed now is a ship and a couple of sturdy nets.)~
@135  = ~If you shared the beach with them as a normal beast would, and not tried to take more than your share of the sea bounty with your nets out and sell in this rotten city, you'd not have been chased away!~
@136  = ~If you are looking for someone to remove these sirines for you, I suggest you look elsewhere. However, I can understand the resentment... you would do well to understand that it was no act of malice on their part. You can not blame them for something that is their nature.~
@137  = ~Sirens' hunt is a cruel quest - listening to their sweet singing, and knowing for true that they but lure men to spill blood that boiled at the first sighting of them. *sighs* I can never quite believe that it is their intent. Maybe, one day, I should stop resisting, and find out for myself.~
@138  = ~I was told that my mother was a siren...~
@139  = ~Knowing you, I am inclined to believe this tale, temptress. I wish I knew how your father... er... never mind.~
@140  = ~Oh, boy, yes, please!~
@141  = ~*raises his eyebrow* I was not aware that they now call it *entropy* in Baldur's Gate... I was away for too long, perhaps.~
@142  = ~My lady, it is my understanding that entropy is the degradation of matter and energy in the universe to an ultimate state of inert uniformity. If that is what your soul sister and you are prepared to exemplify with your heavenly bodies, I am quite intrigued and willing to lend mine for such experimentation... (Yes, yes, I have achieved a delightful proportion of philosophy and risqué, but why did I even bother? I am sure that a simple 'yes' was sufficient - they are not accustomed to my level of sophistication in this barbaric land.)~
@143  = ~Grr! Your eyes are death! Cold gaze, cold! Stay back, you fools.~
@144  = ~Shall we teach you?~
@145  = ~Life is cruel to the weak, get over it.~
@146  = ~Enslaving a bard to do digging? This Davaeorn has a brain the size of walnut! Worry not, troubadour, we are here to set you all free, and kill Davaeorn.~
@147  = ~If you break us free... I would sing a song of you, even if I would not be able to speak after that ever again.~
@148  = ~There is no 148.~
@149  = ~Accompanied by a horde of equally humble baby wyverns? State your purpose here, lest I follow my duty as nature's servant and determine it for myself.~
@150  = ~A fellow huntsman of wyverns, I presume?~
@151  = ~A huntsman, yes. But I have no interest in these... wyverns. I am here for... er... caves.~
@152  = ~Really? And I could have sworn that this faint acidic smell on your cloak is the same that their poison leaves...~
@153  = ~So you are not going to kill the pair? I am not surprised. *Nobody* around here is buying wyvern trophies... I know that for a fact! ~
@154  = ~Er... how long are you  going to stay in this cave, anyway?~
@155  = ~For some time. My... er... spelunking takes time...~
@156  = ~Yes... I'm spelunking.~
@157  = ~Gods! That must be the *new* Lady Silvershield Skie complained so much about. Better-looking, as great a fool, and yet more susceptible, if I am any judge, than the one I have taken such pains over. *sigh* I suppose it is too late to switch at this point...~
@158  = ~Pssst... <CHARNAME>, this is my father's new "wife". Let's get out of here!~
@159  = ~Remember what I told you? With noblewomen, it's boldness that scores. Smile, you rascal!~
@160  = ~You are free, my woodland beauty. Care to celebrate the joyous occasion in a cozy inn? Or in the lovely grotto which you call home... where is it, by the way? Abela?~
@161  = ~*Abela throws a speculative glance at Coran, but then jerks her eyes away and sighs* ~
@162  = ~We'd all be better off to avoid company of town-minded men for some time... not all of us are as fortunate as you, and may take their leave straight away.~
@163  = ~Despair not, sister, you will soon return to the starlit woods.~
@164  = ~Thank you, and farewell.~
@165  = ~Magnificent! Such a tale could fill any tavern or hall in all the Realms!~
@166  = ~Your kind words do warm this young bard's heart – which is useful, considering the weather here. I thank you most humbly.~
@167  = ~That was not a particularly good poem. It surprises me that my beauty didn't inspire him to greater heights.~
@168  = ~Miss, I have long ago decided that I should create poetry about the subjects less fleeting than a woman's beauty.~
@169  = ~Gods save us from plague and poets. (I should have fled when I had the time. Into the hills, the hills, I say!)~
@170  = ~Ah, I would say it is 'into the ruins, into the ruins!' I don't envy your fortune, sir. I do not mind standing around here to soak up the ambient melancholy grace, but to go underground... no, sir!~
@171  = ~I am more appreciative of the subtle symphonies that see themselves played out in the serenity of a forest grove, but I must admit that I found this young bard's tale to my liking. I swear, compared to those fops that pollute the taverns of Baldur's Gate, this man actually restores the good name to his calling!~
@172  = ~I hope you remember that tale, Garrick. At our next stop, you will sit and write it down, as I would like to hear it again.~
@173  = ~Y-yes, ma'am! I sure do remember! Let me see if I can spin my talent and make some improvements to it...~
@174  = ~By Silvanus, DON'T!~
@175  = ~M'lady has fine taste.~
@176  = ~Bard, your ballad brought to my mind the story of Elf-King Echtellion and the Songstress Inga Highwing.~
@177  = ~I would fancy to hear this tale, Master Elf.~
@178  = ~There is a small settlement of Belgarden in Cormyr, on the lands that now are claimed by humans, but of old, they were Elven. One cruel battle was fought there thousands of years ago, ere the Crown Wars. And in it, the fairest and mightiest elf, King Echtellion, was slain - in some noble fashion, of course.~
@179  = ~To commemorate him, Alaundalion the artist carved a statue, to put on his grave. He was said to be in love with Echtellion's sister, and therefore, to please her, he did her bidding and made the statue very lifelike, against the Elven tradition - for we all know that Elves have little talent for the exact depicting of the features, as they ever try to capture the spirit.~
@180  = ~The sister of the King, wise Ogneda, was enamoured with Alaundalion's work, and she quite often came to honor her brother and lay flowers by the statue's feet. It is believed that Ogneda later became mad, convincing herself that the dead stone was her brother. The magic was strong in her, and aided by her insanity, she turned into a banshee.~
@181  = ~The centuries passed, and even Elves, with their long memories, now have little recollection of King Echtellion and his deeds. Yet the statue stood, as whole as it was on the day of its carving. Many a person came, throughout the years, to see the monument, and went away in wonder.~
@182  = ~Inga Highwing stayed.~
@183  = ~The image of the long-dead King captivated her so much that she wanted to know all there was to know about him. She pieced together what shreds of lore she could find, but that was an unsatisfactory harvest. In her love for the King, Inga wrote her own songs about him, and came to his statue every day, at sunrise, to sing to his stone image.~
@184  = ~One night, when she was in the middle of a particularly moving ballad, oh, wonder! The statue stepped down from the column on which it stood and walked over to Inga. Echtellion lived again!~
@185  = ~The small crowd that gathered round went so quiet that a snowflake's fall would have broken the silence. Echtellion's voice had not grown hoarse with disuse, and the whole gathering hearkened to the words he said to Inga Highwing:~
@186  = ~"Seldarine, have mercy on me! You wail worse than my sister!"~
@187  = ~Wh-what?~
@188  = ~Do not despair, bard. Bad poetry has the power to turn stone to flesh and raise dead... ~
@189  = ~Now, <CHARNAME>, were you going to say something?~
@190  = ~And it better be g-good.~
@191  = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@192  = ~How touching.~
@193  = ~You don't even have to turn your back on her, now, for that to happen.~
@194  = ~Coran?! What you mumbling about?~
@195  = ~Oh, nothing, my brave knight.~
@196  = ~Cute as a button, yes...~
@197  = ~Sounds like an, uh, interesting childhood there!~
@198   = ~<CHARNAME>, you need to show this carefree side of yourself more, you know. It would surely help reduce... tension.~
@199   = ~Our chance of survival is meager as is, and it would only aggravate us all the worse if our leader decided to drop her weapons and attire in the middle of battle... Moreover, while <CHARNAME> is fair of face, I have very little confidence that her revealing herself in such a way would have a blinding effect on our enemies, such as from a spell that a dryad could place on her foes...~
@200  = ~Oh, how he laughed!~
@201  = ~Finally! You two have too much liking for talking. Gods, but I love bloodshed.~
@202  = ~I hate killing pretty ladies, especially when they got a spark to them.~
@203  = ~There is a saying in Rashemen: 'It takes two fools to start a fight.'~
@204  = ~Must you have goaded this woman? These killings could have been averted, <CHARNAME>, if we had a wise <PRO_MANWOMAN> for our leader.~
@205  = ~Let's show 'em what we've got!~
@206  = ~One name o' ours ye know, at least, mage - Yeslick Orothiar I am, an' it sickens me ta think that ye're goin' ta share the same grave as me kin. Prepare fer the Abyss, Davaeorn!~
@207  = ~Well, well... the fool escapes, does he? Then let us see whose graves shall be filled!~
@208  = ~Dost not take his words lightly, <CHARNAME>. I sense power about him; he is indeed a mighty magician.~
@209  = ~Tymora's luck, but yer a creep! And to think that I wanted ta be a mage! Brr...~
@210  = ~Did someone say riches? Nothing is sweeter than the spoils honestly earned by slaying bastards!~
@211  = ~As they say:
Met mage by morning,
adventurer take warning
dead mage at night
adventurer's delight.~
@212  = ~I will slay you for your affront to nature, pale townling!~
@213  = ~That's a new one, to be sure. But it matters not. You are dead, druid, though I have heard that your ilk gives death little significance.~
@214  = ~You are right in one thing: we have come to put an end to your torturing and enslaving innocent people. As for us being as good as dead... we shall see. We are not starved slaves for you to bully.~
@215  = ~For Shar!~
@216  = ~Now that we are introduced, prepare to die!~
@217  = ~*rubs her head* I'm gettin' a headache, listening to this guy. I thought we left all those borin' lectures at Candlekeep.~
@218  = ~A pleasent fellow, and so laconic.~
@219  = ~Here, Kivan, is an ideal companion for you. You can share many beautiful hours of brooding silence.~
@220  = ~Thank you for the suggestion, but your own solemn disposition is quite enough to keep me at ease.~
@221  = ~This way, if you please.~
@222  = ~By Seldarine, but when ankhegs spit, they spit big, so we dance as much as we hunt! Almost as much fun as hunting wyverns, eh?~
@223  = ~I will make sure to count the number of the beasts we slay, and that my companions remember the limit.~
@224  = ~May Shaundakul guide you, friend.~
@225  = ~GRRR! Luckily ankhegs do not have the limit for killing hunters. Stupid townling! Ankhegs do not destroy land, it's the farmers who do with their cruel plows and gluttonous beasts!~
@226  = ~Well, that was an interesting insight. While I agree that these beasts are a part of the great cycle of Nature, it would be foolish to disregard the danger they present. And while they do aerate the soil and improve crop yields, they also reduce the number of farmers managing these lands. They love to reduce the ranks of unsuspecting travelers and adventurers as well... particularly of young and foolish ones.~
@227  = ~Simple indeed! I could've done something easy as that when I was but knee-high to a gibberling! Of course, I was a very advanced child.~
@228  = ~Turned to stone for a bit of burglary? *shivers* What *is* the world coming to?!~
@229  = ~'Tis not a just punishment. Enchantments of that sort are not toys to hurl around like a child throwing a tantrum. I urge thee to free these rogues, <CHARNAME>.~
@230  = ~Are you interested?~
@231  = ~A basilisk? We have a problem, fellow adventurers! Perhaps, you should go forth, fearless <CHARNAME>. Your heart is already stone, after all. Why, for all we know, you will be unharmed by the creature's gaze, like all the walking stiffs.~
@232  = ~We should release the beast, not slaughter it! It did not come to this wretched place out of its own volition!~
@233  = ~Fleeee!~
@234  = ~I used to envy doppelgangers at carnival time. Women always seemed to recognize me, despite the costumes.~
@235  = ~Ha, this place is too drab. How about I redecorate it with your blood?!~
@236  = ~Hahaaaaa!~
@237  = ~Allow me to introduce myself, Mayor. I would have done so earlier, but alas, I was rudely diverted from visiting your town by the kobolds. I am Xan of the Evereskan Greycloaks, sent by my people to investigate the iron shortage. ~
@238  = ~We welcome Evereska's help, Xan. Thank you for lending <CHARNAME> a hand with the re-opening of the mines.~
@239  = ~There is no need for gratitude, Berrun. Helping you was our duty, as you well know. Despite my nagging doubts, <CHARNAME> did well, much better than I expected.~
@240  = ~Why, <PRO_HESHE> certainly did! Young <CHARNAME> here is a true hero of Nashkel!~
@241  = ~It is pleasant to know that our labours are well appreciated, <CHARNAME>.~
@242  = ~Mark this young <PRO_MANWOMAN> well, mayor. I sense that 'tis not the last good deed of <PRO_HISHER> thou art hear of.~
@243  = ~Indeed, the town stands in your debt. Have a pleasant and peaceful stay.~
@244  = ~Allow me to introduce myself, Mayor. I would have done so earlier, but alas, I was rudely diverted from visiting your town by the kobolds. I am Xan of the Evereskan Greycloaks, sent by my people to investigate the iron shortage. ~
@245  = ~There is no need for gratitude, Berrun. Helping you was our duty, as you well know. Despite my nagging doubts, <CHARNAME> did well, much better than I expected.~
@246  = ~<CHARNAME>, this man had killed your father. Would you let him get away? Surely, his plans are thwarted, but he lives still.~
@247  = ~<CHARNAME>, the man Sarevok is a Spawn of Bhaal, and he hath turned to madness. He must be stopped at all costs!~
@248  = ~Ma'am, if you knew <CHARNAME> but a little longer, you would not even bother to ask... This robust champion has made it <PRO_HISHER> trade to challenge death. Do not doubt that <PRO_HESHE> would grab for this unique opportunity to finally be done with our lives... Ah, I am getting a sick feeling that I am going into the last fateful battle to sacrifice myself for the sake of killing a madman.~
@249  = ~Whate'er you decide, I'm with ya, <CHARNAME>!~
@250  = ~Will you do this?~
@251  = ~Indeed, we can spare a few hours to help thee, good farmer. Is it not so, <CHARNAME>?~
@252  = ~*Edwin sighs* What did I say about farmers being next in line after fishermen? I hold my breath, O glorious leader... Could it be sheep-shearers laying in wait to beg our assistance behind that pile of manure?~
@253  = ~Please?~
@254  = ~O, <CHARNAME>, thou art a noble <PRO_MANWOMAN>!~
@255  = ~<CHARNAME>, not only have you offered much needed help, but offered it in such a manner that it did not offend the man's pride to accept it. This was a lesson to us all.~
@256  = ~That was an honorable deed, <CHARNAME>! The money will help Farmer Brun maintain his farm without his son.~
@257  = ~And very clever of you, too! Pretending that we do *not* mean to give money to him was the only way to make this proud man accept the donation!~
@258  = ~I would not be a part of this... enterprise!~
@259  = ~I will not allow you to do this bandit's bidding! Defend yourself!~
@260  = ~Hey, back off! We did nothin' wrong!~
@261  = ~Gloat now, iblith, but soon I shall carve those smiling lips from your face!~
@262  = ~If I wert in the position that thou claim as thine, I would not be quick to accuse innocents.~
@263  = ~It is a grave offence to be called a murderer; graver still, for it comes from a lowly man.~
@264   = ~You... you monster! If father were here to stop you, you would be... be hanging from the gallows!~
@265   = ~Ahhh, but sadly he isn't. A tragic, tragic loss to us all. But what is even more tragic is, that in her distraught state of mind his beautiful young daughter decided to take revenge on the men that she thought killed her father... Such a waste. *sigh* No matter...~
@266  = ~How dare you! My father-~
@267  = ~Your father would do nothing, Lady Silvershield. Unless you raise him from his grave.~
@268  = ~What?!? Wha... what are you saying?~
@269  = ~I'm afraid your father, most regrettably, was diced over an extended period of time, by a person or persons unknown.~
@270  = ~Father?.. Wait, you... you're *lying* - father's bodyguards were among the finest in the city's guard... they would never let mere thugs get within a breadth of him.~
@271  = ~Ah... well, due to the present state of emergency, those had to be reassigned to more important duties.~
@272  = ~What?! More IMPORTANT!?! What's more important to the city than the life of a Grand Duke? ~
@273  = ~There are the lives - and property - of all citizens to be secured by maintenance of public order. And, oh yes. There is the invasion from Amn to defend against. Or perhaps in your Grand Tour with your fellow thugs, you'd not heard of that?~
@274  = ~The threat from Amn is YOUR invention! Liar!~
@275  = ~Eldoth, I... I do not know what to believe... Angelo is a liar, that much is true... but something feels wrong... Can we make time to visit the estate? I must know what has happened to my father.~
@276  = ~<CHARNAME>, I... I do not know what to believe... Angelo is a liar, that much is true... but something feels wrong... Can we make time to visit the estate? I must know what has happened to my father.~
@277  = ~Guards! Silence that noisy wench. I have wasted too much time already on the case of these wretched assassins.~
@278  = ~And now I have you.~
@279  = ~O, sorry for scarin' your son an' all, ma'am. Hope he's alright! Ya tell him that some adventurers do good things, like helpin' other folk at need.~
@280  = ~I cannot understand how any woman would want to have a husband and children. I have no time for taking care of anyone but myself... But then again, every matron I met was nowhere nearly as attractive and sophisticated as I am - so maybe they feel that it's pointless?~
@281  = ~Hmmmph... At least the rivvil had money, though ‘twas surely not enough to compensate for the waste of time.~
@282  = ~My friend, it was a noble deed. I wish that more people were as ready as you to lend a helping hand to the small folk.~
@283  = ~Thou didst good in helping this poor woman. Now we should'st return to our travails.~
@284  = ~Take this, and thank you!~
@285  = ~Law? Laws are for weaklings. Just kill the lecher. Who'd cry for a man, anyway?~
@286  = ~A foul deed must this Ragefast have committed to cause such a strong reaction in someone of a noble descent. 'Tis my experience that they rarely care of the fate of the others. We would do good to make inquiries.~
@287  = ~Be assured, murderer, if you ever happen to cross my way again, I will exact justice for those little souls you killed!~
@288  = ~Tiresome, bothersome... I wish I had met you fifteen years earlier, when you were little... oh, yes. How I wish.~
@289  = ~This vile man cannot be let loose.~
@290  = ~*cackles* Stupid elf.~
@291  = ~'Tis vile... so utterly vile! Fire and lightening! I urge thee to... to kill this gnome!~
@292  = ~Kill me? Ha... Some tried, yes, yes... And where are they, precious? Dead.~
@293  = ~Yes, let us follow him, <CHARNAME>... but do not lose sight of him. Once we are outside, I will not hesitate to slay him, and, I trust, you will help.~
@294  = ~*Neb cackles, but it is impossible to discern if it is because he overheard Jaheira's private words, or simply due to his madness.*~
@295  = ~This way!~
@296  = ~'Tis an unexpected turn...~
@297  = ~One does not lock the woman who is his love and life against her will. Let her go, mage, lest you regret ever loving her.~
@298  = ~I came here expecting to find one of those vile mages who would dissect this beautiful creature looking for spell components. Instead, we find a foolish man with his mind clouded by passion and desire. And while he deserves to be admonished for keeping this nymph here against her will, I suppose it can be understood... we would do well to resolve this without bloodshed, <CHARNAME>.~
@299  = ~Just a little more time...~
@300  = ~No, we did *not*, but we will do so immediately. It is so, <CHARNAME>.~
@301  = ~If thou art considering leaving these poor men to their death, thou'd better join them. Death by drowning would be nothing, compared to mine treatment!~
@302  = ~That may be so, but they forgot to inform us that our adversary would be a young child. Rest assured, we will return to exchange a few words with them... and perhaps more than simple words.~
@303  = ~This is despicable! These fishermen sent us to murder a child! <CHARNAME>, I will not stand for this!~
@304  = ~'Tis a very spirited child, but a child nonetheless. I trust that thou hath concluded rightly who is in the wrong here.~
@305  = ~Notice that she has acknowledged the presence of our weapons, yet still addresses us in an arrogant manner; childhood is a time when logic and self-preservation are alien concepts. This one will not grow to find out just how valuable the skills she never acquired were.~
@306  = ~Why are you here?~
@307  = ~<CHARNAME>, let's go! I came here once, as a child, and there are some truly terrific sights...~
@308  = ~We have splendid, splendid new acquisitions, too, sir!~
@309  = ~I would not waste money on this pathetic mausoleum. In this barbaric land, a flint is regarded as the latest invention. (Besides - the brazen boldness, impudent assurance and insolence of praising machinery in my presence! As if gadgets could even be compared with the elegance or efficiency of magic.)~
@310  = ~I am sure, sir, that you will find it to your liking.~
@311  = ~Bah! Doubtlessly, nothing here could compare to the wonders of drow craftsmanship.~
@312  = ~Perhaps, madam, but who had ever seen a drow city and lived to tell the tale? None that I know, that's for sure! And it's warm inside to boot, so you needn't keep your gentle self all wrapped up in your cloak like that against chill.~
@313  = ~I heard that many an artifact here was made, but by the skillful hands and sharp minds, without the use of magic. Will it ever come to pass that the arcane and technical should'st come to a competition for fulfilling a sentient being's need to do things new and wondrous?~
@314  = ~Well said, m'lady, well said.~
@315  = ~And a glimpse of all this, for one small coin.~
@316  = ~Whene'er I witness the follies of mages who practice in countries that place no demands on their skills, I wonder if idleness inevitably leads great minds to madness?~
@317  = ~Uhm, yeah... Are all mages like that? If I were one, I wouldn't work with some slime and ooze... Brrr... It's too uhm... slimy. I'd create candy golems or somethin', if I wanted to be weird.~
@318  = ~(If I became desperate enough in this unenlightened land to reduce myself to discussing magic with hedge witches, I might have noted that casting spells is not making a stew. Magic components don't stain the hand which touched them.)~
@319  = ~*throws a meaningful look <CHARNAME>'s way* (Unless, of course, it is a highly inexperienced hand...)~
@320  = ~<CHARNAME>, why must we stop and talk to each piece of filth we meet in the street?~
@321  = ~Divination is a magic that is rarely practiced in Rashemen. Alas, by need, we place more import on battle spells. If thou would allow this lady to delve thy past and future, I would very much like to see how 'tis done.~
@322  = ~Pitiful fops, dressed in red, do not scare me!~
@323  = ~Beware, <CHARNAME>. If those art indeed the Red Wizards of Thay, the truth of which I have no reasons to doubt, they art as skilled in arts arcane as they art devious.~
@324  = ~This accent... is all too familiar. You must be the Rashemi witch spotted in these parts by our friends. I can see that Edwin did not carry out his mission as ordered. Lasala, I suggest that we not tell him that we have done his job. The farther away he is, the less obstructions he creates for us.~
@325  = ~Nothing personal, of course, but we have to kill you now.~
@326  = ~Ah, yes. We trudged all this way to Baldur's Gate in order to steal a... a Tele-whatzit for this foolish little man. Or am I wrong, <CHARNAME>?~
@327  = ~'Telescope', madam... is such a clumsy word... if you know what I mean... I apologize, if I offended...~
@328  = ~This gnome's hunger for things magical is commendable, but the ways in which he wishes to sate it is not. <CHARNAME>, thou dost not truly command us to this... robbery?~
@329  = ~O, yes, please!~
@330  = ~So, will you?~
@331  = ~This man is surely distraught! Do find out what is wrong here, <CHARNAME>. Mayhap we can help.~
@332  = ~If I am not mistaken, we are about to be burdened with the accursed bloodied dagger this maniac has in his hands. Take it, <CHARNAME>, if you wish to seal our doom. Otherwise let us... just slowly back away from this man.~
@333  = ~Take pity on this creature, <CHARNAME>. All it wants is to find its peace. Give it the dagger.~
@334  = ~Silly creature. You're undead already, and have eternity at your command. Why such impatience?~
@335  = ~Haaaatred... hatred called me back... the dagger... it slew me... any who has it... akin to my murderer... and MUST DIE!~
@336  = ~Such a limited thing, poor dear. And yet totally unamenable to control.~
@337  = ~Fascinating...~
@338  = ~Noooo discussion... RETURN UNTO MEEE! Or I fascinate on your throat for you.~
@339  = ~Oh! Still, if we gave the dagger back, it would probably disappear just to spite me... prolonged study seems out of the question... what do you think, <CHARNAME>?~
@340  = ~Oh, I completely agree with you! So many louts demand instant answers to all kinds of questions, while the true learned such as myself, know that patience is required, due to the consideration that must be given to each and every variable factor...~
@341  = ~Well, uh, that's my excuse anyway.~
@342  = ~Quite.~
@343  = ~Thou art seeing it all in the stars, my good man?~
@344  = ~Yes, my lady.~
@345  = ~Then thy sight is sharp indeed.~
@346  = ~Quite so, m'lady. Well, it has been a pleasure to chat with someone who appreciates my art.~
@347  = ~Nevertheless, I must be off to study my star charts and rub some lotion on my craned neck. Good fortune in your travels, and may the gods be with you.~
@348  = ~'Tis a sad lesson that every young adventurer learns eventually. Being brave doth not make one invincible.~
@349  = ~Grr! Carry a message to your mother - keep the cubs away from the temptations of the man-made world, and they'd be safe.~
@350  = ~Those were the spiders that killed him...~
@351  = ~Your brother trusted a *thing* made by a smith's hand more than his kin's judgment. The arrogant fool deserved his death.~
@352  = ~May... maybe, but what does it matter now?!~
@353  = ~Poor Chelak!~
@354  = ~This squire knight looks trustworthy. Why, he reminds me of my loyal Minsc. He will be a valuable addition to this group.~
@355  = ~Unless you are starting a collection of toy knights or need an anchor for a boat, <CHARNAME>, I would not bother with 'joining forces' with this pompous bastard.~
@356  = ~Fair lady, you wound me with such bitter words.~
@357  = ~What say you, yea or nay?~
@358  = ~Wench, the aging concubines of Thay cover the lamps with pink shades to create a lighting effect more favorable to their failing charms. I see... or, rather, I guess, that you have done the same, choosing a mine as habitat. Surely, in the darkness even you might pass as a woman for a local baboon.~
@359  = ~Certainly my type of lady!~
@360  = ~I will gladly come to the aid of the townsfolk, <CHARNAME>.~
@361  = ~My dear Mayor, from the looks of you, your idea of a handsome reward is a couple of chickens... or is it a pound of butter?~
@362  = ~It's sure nice to be appreciated. Mayor, I can clear the mines of your 'demons' with my right hand tied behind my back.~
@363  = ~We'd appreciate anything you can do for us.~
@364  = ~We... we're not really going to drag around dead bodies, are we? Just the thought of it makes me feel ill!~
@365  = ~No matter how deeply flattered I am by being entrusted with such a blessed assignment, I feel that any benefit that we could possibly reap from performing this mission is not worthy of risking staining my robes with refuse.~
@366  = ~To become a pawn of a twisted necromancer with clear intent on upsetting the delicate cycle of nature? Not me, <CHARNAME>, I refuse to trudge through filthy sewers in search for rotten corpses. Every fiber of my being screams in protest at such a suggestion.~
@367  = ~Ugh... I didn't realise that adventuring would include... *this*.~
@368  = ~A most unpalatable task.~
@369  = ~Beggin' ye're pardon, dark lady, if ye find it morally objec-~
@370  = ~Morally objectionable, were you going to say? By the Nine Hells, no. I simply despise the stench of your sewers more than I do the stench of your surfacer cities.~
@371  = ~Your trade is an affront to Nature, necromancer! On the other hand, the stench from the sewers is so foul that the bodies must be rotting there. I care not that they poison the city's water supply, but they pollute the Sea of Swords itself.~
@372  = ~Grr! Let us do the dung beetles' work this once, <CHARNAME>!~
@373  = ~Brilliant. Brother Thurm's performance was just the thing I was longing for the entire day... <CHARNAME>, I urge you to execute this lot, before we have the chance to enjoy the sounds produced by the vocal cords of the undead.~
@374  = ~What sorcery is this? He... He's talking to them! The man is mad!~
@375  = ~This must be the criminal Bassilus they mentioned in the temple! We must stop his evil deeds!~
@376  = ~What kind of devil is that?! We have to stop him!~
@377  = ~And greetings again, Garrick.~
@378  = ~Tis an honor to see you again, sir.~
@379  = ~The pleasure is all yours, I am most assured.~
@380  = ~Art we well, O Chosen one? As usual, our lives hang by a thread pulled out of a cloak that Shaundakul tossed away, because it would not hold together any longer. We have not felt hope in so many days that yestereve I had to inquire of <CHARNAME> if <PRO_HESHE> could remind me of its proper spelling.~
@381  = ~I'm beginning to see how you've acquired a reputation for, uh, interference... In the best possible sense of the word, sir!~
@382  = ~This grand city is but a multitude of crooked alleys, where one can chance upon the most idiotic characters. But what are the chances of running into the very same idiot twice, and in such close timing? <CHARNAME>, you attract fools, like rotting flesh attracts flies.~
@383  = ~*sighs* Pleasure or surprise? Whatever might be the case. Everyone who meets <CHARNAME> nowadays needs to look at <PRO_HIMHER> for a while... for it is most likely the very last time <PRO_HESHE> will be seen alive...~
@384  = ~How charming. Either be sliced into leather bands by this... harpy, or suffer her company forever. Truly, the madness fills the Sword Coast to the brim and spills over from its peoples. And I am almost sure that some of the suicide mongers who accompany me are ready to jump at the offer...~
@385  = ~If you ask me, <CHARNAME>, we'd better avoid the fight and just give her twenty gold. It would be a small sum to pay for the privilege of not having to drag around this stupid cow and her rusty sword.~
@386  = ~Amazing. I dare anyone to believe in the purity of love after hearing this particular statement of intent.~
@387  = ~To name this one a slime would be an offense to slimes! <CHARNAME>, the only way I would agree to have this creep Eldoth around, is if I can beat him bloody when times are too quiet for my taste.~
@388  = ~Extortion? Blackmail? Those don't sound like very noble goals.~
@389  = ~Hmm, child, you said something?~
@390  = ~Child?!? I-~
@391  = ~I do assure you it pains me to do this, but you must think of my lover, Skie! This is the only way she can escape the tyranny of her life. So, what do you say?~
@392  = ~Think on it a while, if you like.~
@393  = ~Ah, true love! Perhaps we could help Fergus in this matter?~
@394  = ~For a love-blinded fool, he sees well enough how to profit from a stranger's stupidity. Angel skins are expensive this year, <CHARNAME>...~
@395  = ~Wow, I don't think I've ever heard a gnoll speak before. Perhaps we should check it out?~
@396  = ~So, she is still alive... Hurry, <CHARNAME>, before I have my prize barbequed, courtesy of these unwashed wildlings. ~
@397  = ~Ewww... gross! I feel sick all of a sudden.~
@398  = ~Well, seems like those other gnolls wanna keep Dynaheir alive for a bit longer at least, so... um, I guess that's good news, huh, Minsc?~
@399  = ~Good news! Minsc's witch lives! My boot is itching to kill the evil gnolls and free magnificent Dynaheir from their evil ways! Raaagh!~
@400  = ~Yessss, I will rooaasst herrrr...~
@401  = ~It has been my experience, that in the matters of life and death it is always beneficial to lie. But you can be truthful with these goons, if you wish - they have this particular look about them... how should I call it? Ah, 'pawns doomed to be slaughtered momentarily'.~
@402  = ~*sigh* What kind of land is this where your name alone can cause you to be slaughtered by brutes?~
@403  = ~At least these particular ones do not look all that bright.~
@404  = ~My under-qualified leader, why won't you give this mob the sweet-sounding name of Gevalenties Mordabintius Celebrantus?~
@405  = ~I'm waiting!~
@406  = ~Meilum? I don't, ah, think so. What about you, <CHARNAME>?~
@407  = ~Even if I have heard your name, it would have escaped me, fledgling swordsman... It does not hold sufficient sonority. As compared to, say, Edwin Odesseiron... (Now, there is true magnificence!)~
@408  = ~A mere babe, just out of swaddling clothes.~
@409  = ~Dismissing my skill as such just shows you to be the ignorant one, drow.~
@410  = ~You must have heard of me.~
@411  = ~You have minions? And I've all but taken you for one...~
@412  = ~O, Seldarine...~
@413  = ~To arms, then! We shall prevail!~
@414  = ~Now!~
@415  = ~Yeah! You go walk away, you charlatan!~
@416  = ~I can say things like that, link it to some mumbo-jumbo about star alignments and other stuff too, you know, and make it sound just vague enough to cover almost any circumstance.~
@417  = ~Wait a second here... hmm...~
@418  = ~The oldest trick of the incompetent is to cover their impotency up with a show of righteous outrage. More common amongst paladins, though, than among the students of arcane.~
@419  = ~Begone!~
@420  = ~I have to agree, for I do come from glorious Thay, which is only a few years away from proving to the rest of Faerun that it is indeed the center of the universe.~
@421  = ~Why, of course the Sword Coast is the centre of the universe. At least for now - because that's where I am. You see, darling, I met this absolutely dashing philosopher once, who tried to seduce me with learning. Much of it were silly things, like giving up material wealth for... something; but one was useful. He taught that the only part of the world that exists is the one that rotates around us. I knew it all along, but it was pleasant to see that the sages are finally catching up with me... ~
@422  = ~Indeed, there are those who have never even heard of the Sword Coast.~
@423  = ~Oh, my... I sure am glad to be an adventurer.~
@424  = ~<CHARNAME>, this woman's offer sounds quite... intriguing. Surely you cannot pass the opportunity of rescuing a damsel in distress? (Yes, that ought to give them a small push in the right direction... They'll do most of the work, and, knowing the effect that I have on women, I should reap all of the pleasure. Finally, something worthy of my attention!)~
@425  = ~You won't regret it.~
@426  = ~Wow.~
@427  = ~Grr, I wish your name had imprinted one of the trees' virtues on you - their sage quietude.~
@428  = ~A townling is badmouthing a servant of nature? Death to him! Wait, why are you in town, druid? Are you one of those perverted druids who teach us that cities - Never mind for now. First to killing the mage!~
@429  = ~On behalf of my group, I apologize for the intrusion. I swear on my oath of druidry that intruding on other people's privacy is not a hobby of mine, nor of my companions. Perhaps, to even out this misunderstanding, we could deal with this Gervisse of yours?~
@430  = ~Hmm, another druid here in the city. How... odd. I suppose you could try speaking with him; I do not see how you could make things worse. I have tried to drive him away, but in return he now spreads ugly rumors about me. If you rid this neighborhood of him, I would be grateful.~
@431  = ~Saving talking chickens from big bad wolves! Bah! It'd be much merrier if those were Flaming Fists that accosted you.~
@432  = ~<CHARNAME>! It's a wolf chasing a chicken... we should not intervene in the cycle of life... WAIT A MINUTE! It's TALKING! Abhorrent humans! Could not leave poor chick to his clucking! Tell me creature who - NO! Do not *tell* me anything! I would not encourage you to act in an unnatural way!~
@433  = ~Buc-becaw-kill-the-wolf! Buc-becaw-stupid!~
@434  = ~HELLLLP-becaw!~
@435  = ~... because "luck" runs out... A good saying.~
@436  = ~And you would do well to remember it, young adventurers.~
@437  = ~Well met, sir, and farewell.~
@438  = ~Always remember that because of you a wolf has died.~
@439  = ~And good thing it is...~
@440  = ~What?! How dare you?! This noble beast was worth ten of your kind! Perhaps I can even the score by sending you after the wolf!~
@441  = ~Er... of course. I... I apologize, druid.~
@442  = ~You have a remarkable gift for angering people, Melicamp.~
@443  = ~Farewell.~
@444  = ~Creeeepppy. I hope we never end up being tortured like that.~
@445  = ~Here, <CHARNAME>, here is another awful consequence of civilization! A wild beast finishes his kill and eats it! But "cultured" beings satisfy their hunger by slaughtering enslaved cows and pigs - so their natural instinct to kill for food gets perverted into a desire to murder and cause pain!~
@446  = ~Ye sick fiend... ye've made a pain-house out o' me home! DIE, YE FILTH!~
@447  = ~Hahaha!~
@448  = ~You... you are a trickster! I HATE you, <CHARNAME>! Grrr!~
@449  = ~<CHARNAME>, I am taken aback by your plan to help these scoundrels cut down this old mighty tree! It is the home of a dryad!~
@450  = ~You knew full well that I would not stand for this, <CHARNAME>! I cannot let you murder this innocent creature! I do not relish breaking my oath to Gorion and raising a weapon against you, but you leave me no choice!~
@451  = ~It seems that I will have to face you in c-combat, <CHARNAME>, little as I r-relish it, but I c-cannot let you c-c-commit this evil act. I will always stand by Jaheira's side in this.~
@452  = ~A hero's work is never done.~
@453  = ~Another fool freed. Oh, <CHARNAME>, what a hero you truly are.~
@454  = ~I have heard many a tale of poor fellows subdued by evil enchantments, but to hear of one happening now is terrible! <CHARNAME> we must help!~
@455  = ~And evil magic thrives against weak will; something you humans have in abundance.~
@456  = ~Self–flagellation? Oh, my...~
@457  = ~Hold on here, <CHARNAME>! Since when did you become a follower of the Crying God? What's more, since when do ya go around saying we're *all* followers of Ilmater? I certainly am not! But er... whatever floats yer boat.~
@458  = ~I can't see the wood for the subterranean trees...~
@459  = ~Subterranean trees? Ha! Any fool could have thought of a better lie than that, iblith.~
@460  = ~Um... No, really, it's a little known, uh, field of study... Been kept mostly hush-hush for, ah, conservation purposes.~
@461  = ~Useful things, subterranean trees, but rare.~
@462  = ~Your power of observation is stunning, drow.~
@463  = ~The famed ranger, Drizzt Do'Urden!~
@464  = ~Indeed, and well met, young man! Will you aid me?~
@465  = ~Drizzt is a noble warrior, <CHARNAME>. We must help him!~
@466  = ~This high and mighty wizard seems an arrogant type indeed, and those red robes hint at a Thayvian... We should be careful of our dealings with him, <CHARNAME>.~
@467  = ~You want us to fall upon a woman like a score of brigands and kill her? You ask an evil thing, Edwin Odesseiron, and have no proof of the woman's taint or trespass against you. <CHARNAME>, we'll do well to warn Dynaheir of this man's plotting.~
@468  = ~You want to kill Minsc's witch?!~
@469  = ~Your witch?! (Of all the adventurer groups in Faerun, I had to ask *these* particular baboons.)~
@470  = ~Yes, MY witch! Begone, sleazy Red Wizard, lest Boo have your eyes!~
@471  = ~Sleazy?! I bathed this morn! (Which is more than I can say about this gorilla.)~
@472  = ~Yes, sleazy! Now go, before I set my hamster on you!~
@473  = ~It's not your call, you overfed... overfed... monkey! (Yes, that will do.)~
@474  = ~This high and mighty wizard seems an arrogant type indeed, and those red robes hint at a Thayvian... We should be careful of our dealings with him, <CHARNAME>.~
@475  = ~What say you?~
@476  = ~The History of the Dead Three – he's right, a dark tale indeed. Merely thinking of those fell deities sends shivers down my spine.~
@477  = ~Hmm... an odd choice of a reward, as well as an odd choice of words. Both set me ill at ease, to be truthful.~
@478  = ~A strange choice of book; my guess is the old fool couldn't stomach the reading for himself.~
@479  = ~Yes, it is dark, but history often is.~
@480  = ~<CHARNAME>, what price, for innocent life? I say we refuse this Gallor's offer and inform Charleston.~
@481  = ~Nine hundred gold sounds like a fair price for the job. Don't be a pansy, <CHARNAME>, accept the offer!~
@482  = ~These diggers have no life to speak of, anyways. What with this drooling over some long-dead housewife's garbage?~
@483  = ~Uh-oh. The Happiness Boys. Grab hold o' yer wallets 'n loosen yer blades.~
@484  = ~Ha! Ha! A smart fellow with excellent survival instincts. No need to exercise them now, though. We're still drinking our last score. Won't start thinking about our next one 'til we sober up.~
@485  = ~Wouldn't mind a half, then. T' start with.~
@486  = ~We have many a tale to spin; what say you, <CHARNAME>?~
@487  = ~So, what have you got to say of yourselves?~
@488  = ~Surely there must be something we can do to help!~
@489  = ~There. Don't worry, lady. We'll try and save Brage for you, 'kay?~
@490  = ~Please! I'd be most grateful for any help you can give him!~
@491  = ~That's monstrous!~
@492  = ~I saw a true artist near Nashkel mines. Prism poured his soul into a carving of rare beauty - and he gave all of himself to bring the stone to life. You, on the contrary, take others' lives, madman, and you have created naught but a garden of fear... they are not statues, Mutamin, they are... dead stone.~
@493  = ~Do you expect me to start screaming at the top of my lungs, because of your stupid lizards? I killed two yesterday; see this belt? Bring them on; I can use more! And I'll let you keep the eyes, heh.~
@494  = ~Heheh... Keep to the roadssss, yessssss.~
@495  = ~No trouble, fair lady!~
@496  = ~Ugh. More fetch-and-carry tasks. Could we not have left just one undone?~
@497  = ~You don't really believe that, do ya, <CHARNAME>?~
@498  = ~I can say things like that, link it to some mumbo-jumbo about star alignments and other stuff too, you know, and make it sound just vague enough to cover almost any circumstance.~
@499  = ~Wait a second here... hmm...~
@500  = ~Interesting. It seems there is much afoot in the Realms.~
@501  = ~That there is. Mayhap one day some of you will be a part of it. Think on that.~
@502  = ~I have much to think on indeed.~
@503  = ~I have met the mage, Thalantyr, before. He is a good man, and I will not stand for an assault on him. It is worthwhile to visit him, however, and perhaps trade with him, <CHARNAME>. He will be interested in magical items, if we ever have them in surplus.~
@504  = ~That's the home of Thalantyr, a wise and powerful mage. I'd, uh, caution against trying to rob him, <CHARNAME>.~
@505  = ~Good luck!~
@506  = ~All orders are doomed to fail sooner or later, but something tells me that your own doom will come even faster than ours, if <CHARNAME> makes such a decision.~
@507  = ~Oh, do shut up. I've met kobolds more ‘enlightened' than you.~
@508  = ~What? Who dares defy my rule! Explain yourselves!~
@509  = ~Compassion is a weakness. Kill him, <CHARNAME>.~
@510  = ~It is a trap... mark my words, the fiend is luring us into some devious trap...~
@511  = ~That can surely be arranged.~
@512  = ~Exhilarating! Finally, instead of 'you're all going to die' a villain gives us a choice: to kill or be killed. Wait! Have not we had it all along?~
@513  = ~That choice was always before you.~
@514  = ~The s-stench... all the blood and these m-m-mangled b-bodies... I c-c-can't...~
@515  = ~Steady now, Khalid! 'Tis revolting indeed, but you are not alone here, and you are not weak. I know you will not fail me!~
@516  = ~I... I n-needed that, my love... and you are right.~
@517  = ~Let us p-put an end to this horrible m-monster... he m-must be stopped!~
@518  = ~I think NOT!~
@519  = ~There is a satisfaction of sorts in saying 'I told you so!' Unfortunately, I do not have long to enjoy it: from what I have heard, monsters even on the surface have revolting table manners; how could one expect the ones of the sewers to engage into a pleasant prolonged conversation, before sitting to dinner?~
@520  = ~Kill them, my pets!~
@521  = ~Pfft...~
@522  = ~The mention of it gave him back his reason; immediately he demanded it to be dealt out to him in a lawful fashion, for the reason that he had caused it... This man is almost as entangled with death as we are, <CHARNAME>.~
@523  = ~Bring me to justice. I've earned the fate that awaits me.~
@524  = ~Had you heard the tale about a rescued djinni, <CHARNAME>? After a thousand years in his bottle the djinni vowed to serve whoever would release him for three and thirty years; but none came. After ten thousand years he vowed to fulfill three wishes of his rescuer. And after fifty thousand years he vowed to kill whoever would uncork the bottle.~
@525  = ~I am leaving it to you to guess what his perplexed would-be savior got as a reward... and why I was reminded of this very story just now.~
@526  = ~<CHARNAME>, a man can be tortured and killed, but he will keep his honor. A woman who is a captive of brutish savages will be dishonored... I urge you to help find this man's companion, before it's too late.~
@527  = ~<CHARNAME>, this sounds exactly like one of those stories where unwise and incapable adventurers summon great evil out of bravado. Usually a company of well-known heroes just happens nearby to subdue the unleashed demons and rescue the pathetic miscreants. Since I have no luck to speak of, I do not experience a burning desire to trust it and let such a tale to unfold before my very eyes. Besides, in this godsforsaken town *we* represent the 'well-known' heroes. Even the most optimistic moron can appreciate that we are not up to fighting ancient evils of even local importance. Let us be away.~
@528  = ~This is so tempting... <CHARNAME>, I want to see this mageling's wrath! And kill him for threatening me, of course.~
@529  = ~Begone!~
@530  = ~Hey, ya know what? <CHARNAME> over 'ere was just locked out of <PRO_HISHER> home-town without a penny, and some monsters killed <PRO_HISHER> father. If anyone here should be jumping cliffs, it's <PRO_HIMHER>! And d'ya see <PRO_HIMHER> jumpin'? So what's yer problem?~
@531  = ~Peculiar. You are going to end your life, because you think it is pointless, and I think life is pointless, because it is going to end...~
@532  = ~I'll do it, I swear!~
@533  = ~Oh, these tender males of Nashkel! One's gone off his rocker, and another weeps over his fate! I hope that nobody *here* dares to tell me that men are the stronger sex!~
@534  = ~<CHARNAME>, I refuse to believe that any man in his right mind would slay his own kin.~
@535  = ~Aye, we've troubles enough. Curse the madness that took him.~
@536  = ~Huh, this man gave me the creeps. I mean, pickin' a pocket is one thing, but killin' a dozen workers to steal some stupid artifact is... horrible!~
@537  = ~I am afraid that he might succeed in finding help. We should visit with Charleston, to ward off the bloodshed.~
@538  = ~Off with you!~
@539  = ~Firewine Bridge... that sounds familiar... where did I hear it? Uhm... In any case, ruins are ALWAYS full of treasure! And since we're experienced adventurers, we've nothin' ta worry about. Let's go there one day.~
@540  = ~Firewine Bridge had been built by the elves, <CHARNAME>. It used to be a trading town, until it was destroyed nigh two centuries ago. Two powerful wizards fought a duel nearby, and they had unleashed so much magical energy that they had leveled the houses and changed the course of the stream forever. I would dearly like to see what still remains.~
@541  = ~It's worth the walk, though, I'll give ye that.~
@542   = ~True, you have had an agreement, but this woman's life is worth more than words. Only a blackhearted man would fault you should you break that agreement. But, perhaps, Ramazith can be persuaded to free you from your word.~
@543   = ~So much ceremony in the cities of men... listen to your heart, elf. Does it not tell you to free me?~
@544   = ~It does, but there is still hope that <CHARNAME> comes to <PRO_HISHER> senses before blood is spilt on your behalf.~
@545   = ~Blood... *shivers* blood is awful...~
@546  = ~I do not agree with our course of action. You would hand over a sentient being in slavery or worse for a few baubles? I suggest you rethink this, before we speak with Ramazith again, for I will not watch idly.~
@547  = ~*sigh*~
@548  = ~It is nice to be recognised for my importance, for once!~
@549  = ~Nope, no need...~
@550  = ~Ah, I see you've brought my old friend Alora with you. Staying out of trouble, I hope.~
@551  = ~*gulp* Y-yes, guildmaster.~
@552  = ~I'm glad to hear it. After all, we wouldn't want a repeat of that little... 'incident', now would we?~
@553  = ~Err, n-no, guildmaster.~
@554  = ~Good. Now, to business.~
@555  = ~Now, to business.~
@556  = ~Then you should not have even let us enter! Die, rivvil!~
@557  = ~Now they show their true faces! I second your decision not to cooperate with these people. Let us fight these criminals, we are doing the city a favour by cleaning this den of thieves!~
@558  = ~Or cleansing it of yourselves!~
@559  = ~Draw steel!~
@560  = ~Ah, the infamous Shadow Archdruid himself, as unbalanced and unreasonable as any of his followers, as one can judge by the way of this greeting. And if the sickle that will try to cut me down is as dull as your wit, then I have very little to fear. <CHARNAME> and I shall clear this wood of the taint of Shadow Druids, so that the *true* druids can resume their caring nurturing of the forest.~
@561  = ~You are as good at platitudes as your mentor Seniyad.~
@562  = ~Minsc doesn't understand. Why do all these people hate Jaheira so much? She's a nice lady! Maybe a little too bossy, and a bit edgy... hm... actually, she reminds Minsc of Berthe the Unmarried back home...~
@563  = ~*Squeak*~ [GAM_48]
@564  = ~What Boo? No, I don't think I want her to pull my ear again...~
@565  = ~Imagine what she would do to us if she knew *we* got Khalid so drunk at the Jovial Juggler...~
@566  = ~Ahem!~
@567  = ~So it was you! Rest assured, we'll have some words on this... later.~
@568  = ~Sometimes I think you do that on p-purpose, Minsc.~
@569  = ~The Great Mother does not care if you understand her or not, bug. She walks Her own course. And so should I, Her servant.~
@570  = ~Helm be with us! A henchman of our worst enemy in command of the Flaming Fist? There must be a way of disproving his position and rebutting the sentence he put on us!~
@571  = ~In this city, knight, it is my way or the gibbet.~
@572  = ~I'm too young to die! <CHARNAME>, we've got to do something!~
@573  = ~Watching scum trying to float never fails to amuse me.~
@574  = ~Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some arrangements to make before your sentence can be carried out.~
@575  = ~Actually, uh, I think that smell might be me. But I'm glad that you like it!~
@576  = ~Hmph. One of mortality's pimps. Or jesters. Both. Neither. No matter, he is of no importance in death's great scheme of things. ~
@577  = ~I have no time for philosophy.~
@578  = ~Ah, yes, I've work to do now.~
@579  = ~This priest is out of his mind. Perhaps a hearty stroke with a hammer will put him back in it again.~
@580  = ~You are mad yourself, sister, but you will be cured shortly...~
@581  = ~It figures that such a twisted, vile wretch would be spawned from nowhere else but Zhentil Keep... a mad servant to an equally mad god! But worry not, you will not sow strife any longer, dirty Zhent!~
@582  = ~You will see Cyric's glory when you rejoin the family, my lost sister...~
@583  = ~This might sting a bit...~
@584  = ~DIE!~
@585  = ~I think not, wretch. Begone! Unless <CHARNAME> takes pity on you.~
@586  = ~Please, <PRO_SIRMAAM> <CHARNAME>, take pity...~
@587  = ~Oh.. you poor soul. Here, take this coin and get something to eat.~
@588  = ~*sigh* Another soul gone south! Oh, well. I suppose, at need, we can nick it back from the bartender, who will receive it anon.~
@589  = ~But... but... I'm... *so* hungry... ~
@590  = ~Really?!? Then your hard-begged coin is safe from me, for I refuse to clip a rats'-meat vendor.~
@591  = ~You're a saint, milady.~
@592  = ~And thy ladyship... pssst... ditch that pigeon... ~
@593  = ~I'm grateful for any scraps that fall my way.~
@594  = ~Best time for it in our line of work, anyway...~
@595  = ~Err, I have no idea what you're talking about.~
@596  = ~Heh, course you don't. See ya, Bell.~
@597  = ~See you 'round, Lori.~
@598  = ~Thanks for the tip, diminutive one. I think I'd quite enjoy paying this Phandalyn a visit, <CHARNAME>. To teach him the futility of his life, perhaps?~
@599  = ~Yikes, a drow, if I've ever seen one! No wonder ol' Phandalyn is huffing and puffing with righteous fury and all.~
@600  = ~Your call for help won't go unheard. We will do what we can to find the reasons for the evil occurrences in your mine!~
@601  = ~Onwards we march then, <CHARNAME>. As this is your first mission, I fear that my skills as a healer will be heavily tested. Nevertheless, I will try to return all of us to Berrun still in one piece and victorious.~
@602  = ~It  was the right choice not to ally with this evil creature, <CHARNAME>!~
@603  = ~It is very likely that she possesses a cruel and evil heart, and I suppose that no one will cry for her. But still, I am a little unsettled about the ease with which you took the decision, <CHARNAME>.~
@604  = ~We will surely do that, my friend. Soon, those half-ogres won't be a threat any longer.~
@605  = ~You need not say more, Bjornin. The half-ogres are as good as dead.~
@606  = ~Oh, the gory details of the conquest of this insurmountable fortress... Truly, my head is spinning with excitement.~
@607  = ~Hmph, she always was a gutter tramp. *sigh* If only father would've listened...~
@608  = ~A coin for your effort, my good <PRO_MANWOMAN>...~
@609  = ~Whoa! That's some really creepy magic there!~
@610  = ~<CHARNAME> can handle most things, and dear Monty here is as hard to kill as a cockroach. And you... you can hide in the jar with me!~
@611  = ~<CHARNAME> can handle most things, and <PRO_HESHE> is as hard to kill as a cockroach. And you... you can hide in the jar with me!~
@612  = ~Fool! You are more mad even than Carsa! Death will fit you well! KAHRK!~
@613  = ~OH MIGHTY KAHRK!!!~
@614  = ~From the look of the surrounding area, a deadly spider's attack is no surprise... Why did we venture into this ghastly cave?~
@615  = ~Hmmm. Does the Spider Queen have servants even here? ‘Ware, <CHARNAME>, for if so, those spiders could be lethal indeed.~
@616  = ~Consider this, <CHARNAME>. *She points to all the corpses* We're all but done -just need to finish off this one. We don't even have to go far to bury him properly. This tomb is roomy enough. *Laughs.*~
@617  = ~And Gallor can have his sarcophagus, if you are afraid of the stupid curses.~
@618  = ~Ugh! My head hurts just trying ta make sense of what you're sayin' about this... Kozah. But, um, I guess he was some evil god, and this place has something ta do with him, like a temple, right?~
@619  = ~Yes. Basically you're right. What of it?~
@620  = ~So those workers we just killed attacked us cuz of him or somethin' or another, right? Well then, how come none of us were affected, huh?~
@621  = ~I am unable to answer your question. We know little of this culture, and that is why I was doing research. I doubt that I would ever have an answer for you, Imoen.~
@622  = ~You sound glad to discover that your adversary is the weaker critter. Hells and demons, but you are a pathetic one, even for a male! <CHARNAME>, this idiot would be of no use for us. We can kill the wyverns without having to share the reward with him.~
@623  = ~An ancient red will not burn us to a crisp, but we'd die of poison, instead. <CHARNAME>, have mercy on us, walk wide around this suicidal maniac... though then we risk fording this mighty stream. Under current weather conditions, it can only lead to influenza. Why, oh why did you choose this bridge?~
@624  = ~The scenery, mellonamin, the scenery...~
@625  = ~So, are you as jittery as this cold-footed, long-faced fellow?~
@626  = ~Do we hunt together?~
@627  = ~Sounds like an interesting relationship you have there.~
@628  = ~Now, I can understand the desire to kill, but other than that, you sicken me, woman. Not only are you a consort, but you are *proud* of this! You call a male your Lord and vie for his favor! *spit* I much prefer killing men, but in this case, I would take great pleasure in slaying you!~
@629  = ~Daddy? You call your father 'daddy' and run to him to heal your stupid cat? *Stares at the nodding girl for a moment.* Beat it, brat! Your dead cat's hair irritates my eyes.~
@630  = ~I have mixed feelings about this, <CHARNAME>. On one hand, I detest everything that concerns the vile practice of necromancy... but on the other hand, only a monster could remain unmoved, when facing a plea of a crying child.~
@631  = ~I must bring Pixie to Daddy!~
@632  = ~<CHARNAME>, this is Drizzt Do'Urden, a well known honorable ranger! Don't be misled by his looks. If he is in need, we should help him defeat his attackers!~
@633  = ~FINALLY, a warrior with real potential! Though he COULD use a good dose of enthusiasm.~
@634  = ~Should I weep now? (Such suffering, such unease...)~
@635  = ~Grrr! The drow's scimitars are pretty and sharp, but the Emerald Ray scimitar is what I want. That's the proper weapon for a druid. Did I tell you that it was forged from Kador the Burner's sickle? Kador was a famous Shadow Druid... if only I had it!~
@636  = ~For the good cause, druid, I would fight with my bare hands.~
@637  = ~Or with boulders... yes, boulders are good.~
@638  = ~*smiles* If you are of the giantkin.~
@639  = ~Farewell.~
@640  = ~Such beauty! We cannot allow this affront to nature!~
@641  = ~You speak truth, even if you are dressed like a city-dweller.~
@642  = ~Do not let yourself become bewitched by this one, <CHARNAME>. Begone, spirit! We have no time for you!~
@643  = ~Oh, please, I am in peril and need the help of brave adventurers like yourselves!~
@644  = ~Grr! Lead us, dryad, and I swear that the enemies of nature will be destroyed!~
@645  = ~Thank you, O servant of Silvanus.~
@646  = ~Please, save this tree!~
@647  = ~You... you brought dishonor upon me! I am not *welcome* in the wood! I HATE you, <CHARNAME>! Grrr! I will show you the proper way!~
@648  = ~Please, help me, druid!~
@649  = ~To say that I am disappointed is to say nothing at all. If not for my oath to Gorion, I would have given you a good beating for this ruthlessness.~
@650  = ~I must find help!~
@651  = ~False savior, I defy thee!~
@652  = ~No, this cannot be! All true heroes, hang your heads in shame!~
@653  = ~Idiot.~
@654  = ~<CHARNAME>, you aren't seriously considering killing a person you've never met before, without even knowing the accusations against her, are you? Let us not raise weapons against this Dynaheir before we have heard the whole story!~
@655  = ~The "story" is that she is a Rashemi witch! Anything else would surely overwhelm your tiny little minds.~
@656  = ~Not only have you agreed to kill a woman, but you insist on bringing this burdensome... weakling along! Look at him! He bends nigh in two under the weight of his staff! Are you blind or stupid, <CHARNAME>?~
@657  = ~*whispering* Hey, <CHARNAME>. Why did you agree to work with this guy? He seems, well, creepy.~
@658  = ~I heard that, rogue. It is none of your concern, as the matter was settled between <CHARNAME> and myself.~
@659  = ~Let us go.~
@660  = ~<CHARNAME>, I hope you don't seriously consider carrying out this false plan?~
@661  = ~I dunno 'bout this guy. I mean his scheme isn't all that terribly bad or anything, but I get the feeling he's not tellin' us everything.~
@662  = ~Shall we go?~
@663  = ~Minsc says not to trust them, <CHARNAME>! Look, Boo's getting all jittery and ready for battle! This is a trap!~
@664  = ~Must we follow the whims of a hamster now? A *Rashemi* hamster... (But I think I'll get a fireball ready... just in case...)~
@665  = ~I must admit I agree with Minsc, <CHARNAME>!~
@666  = ~By Helm, the lies and the hides of these fiends reek of evil. Let us prepare for battle!~
@667  = ~Huh, someone is grumpy today. Must have gotten up on the wrong side o' the bed or somethin'.~
@668  = ~'Tis unwise to treat those who would help thee with disrespect. Moreover to threaten them. Or dost thou not wish thy mine cleared of the vermin that plagues it?~
@669  = ~Hey, I'm not <PRO_HISHER> father's child, leave me out of this! I've never even met <PRO_HISHER> father!~
@670  = ~Look, another cur come to die at our hands. Your following of your father's ways is made all the easier by the number of fools throwing themselves against us.~
@671  = ~A drow travels with you? You have made allies in darker places than I imagined...~
@672  = ~Do not invoke the Great Mother's name! You and your like had corrupted her, used her kindness, and perverted her very essence. The Great Mother favoring farmers... how foul is that! Soon, very soon, the Shadow Druids will cure her from this evil sorcery.~
@673    = ~Thou had'st done well in accepting this task, <CHARNAME>.~
@674  = ~That sure would mean pretty big bones...~
@675  = ~Well, you're certainly right about that one.~
@676  = ~And within a week they're partying like they never have before, right?~
@677  = ~Sometimes sooner, miss! Say... have we met before?~
@678  = ~Don't think so. Only Luckyfoot I ever met was old Wendal, back in Berdusk.~
@679  = ~Ah, my favorite third cousin! How's he doing?~
@680  = ~Just fine. He and the missus were expecting their seventh kid, when I left town. I bet she'll be as cute as the others...~
@681  = ~And to think the pair'd only just had their third when I last saw 'em! I really must make the journey up there sometime, I heard it's a nice enough place, for a human built town... err, looks like your friend's getting rather impatient with all this family stuff. What were we talking about? Ah yes, a trip to the tower versus halfling hospitality...~
@682  = ~Our business is our own to mind, and ye'd better be keepin' yer nose to yerself.~
@683  = ~Let out the filthy gnolls to let them do evil? Boo's blood boils at the thought! Minsc smells righteous butt-kicking coming! Er... and many other foul smells, too... Yes, Boo, it was very *stupid* of the bandits to lock the whole clan of gnolls in such a small cave for so long.~
@684  = ~They are no prisoners, <CHARNAME>. Most likely they are bandits who were too unruly even for Chill!~
@685  = ~<CHARNAME>, this is no time for careful deliberations: a woman is threatened with torture! I pray that we are not too late already!~
@686  = ~I was just thinking how refreshing it would be to kick some man in the groin. And break his skinny neck afterwards… Stop gawking, <CHARNAME>. There is coin to be made and fun to be had. On we go!~
@687  = ~Yeah, that was a real rotten thing she tricked <CHARNAME> into doing!~
@688  = ~You'll be much better off with us...~
@689  = ~<CHARNAME>, he can join us, right? *giggles* He is cute and he is a real bard! Someone's gotta write ballads about my beauty and bravery, ya know?~
@690  = ~You... you truly think that I am... er... cute?~
@691  = ~Look at your narrow chest! Look at your slumped shoulders! Look at your skinny legs! I bet you'd be whining for a rest after a half-day's march!~
@692  = ~<CHARNAME>, a bard in a party is not a good thing. Especially a *male* bard!~
@693  = ~<CHARNAME>, *another* bard in a party is not a good thing. Especially a *male* bard!~
@694  = ~<CHARNAME>, *another* bard in a party is not a good thing. Not to mention another *male* bard!~
@695  = ~Or do you like them... scrawny?~
@696  = ~Er... lady... er... slow down.~
@697  = ~So what do you say? Can I come?~
@698  = ~You, Garrick, an ASSET?! Even a bard should not exaggerate so shamelessly! You, who had to hire help to fight three peasants?~
@699  = ~Hahaha! Again, again! *claps*~
@700  = ~Such an amazing show! I wonder how he does it. I'm sure I could figure it out one bored afternoon.~
@701  = ~Nay, but he be worth *your* life t' me. Bounty on ‘im is at least.~
@702  = ~I've heard of you... You are Greywolf, and you will be making your apologies to Ysena in Hades to<DAYNIGHT>, or my name is not Shar-Teel!~
@703  = ~Shar-Teel? You must be the ridiculous brat Ysena scooped out of the gutter!~
@704  = ~The one and only, though you'll find me a little more than just a brat. You betrayed Ysena to the Fists, because of a quarrel over the reward for a run-away slave. I've been wanting to meet you for a long time, Greywolf - do you know why?~
@705  = ~*grins* Do enlighten me.~
@706  = ~So I can skewer your guts through with the point of my sword.~
@707  = ~Wrong!~
@708  = ~Die!~
@709  = ~You got that last bit right, sister! Only they are no callous brutes; more like vapid maggots, dirty pigs, loud-mouthed weaklings, faeces of a diarrheatic monkey...~
@710  = ~If he can bind the creature to him, let him keep the slave.~
@711  = ~You! You think like one of the men!~
@712  = ~A mage is keeping a nymph enslaved. We should look into this, <CHARNAME>, these are worrying words for me to hear. And be careful for what you wish, woman... once the world were rid of all men, you might realize how much you miss them.~
@713  = ~A mage is keeping a nymph enslaved. We should look into this, <CHARNAME>, these are worrying words for me to hear. But you are wrong to think that all men are callous brutes, woman. Ah, but I should not boast about my fortune.~
@714  = ~*blush* Ah, Jaheira... you... you shouldn't have...~
@715  = ~Don't you agree?~
@716  = ~This tale must be dark indeed, if she asks for a reward. The foul tales art enough and to spare in this land, and art told freely to every passerby who would listen.~
@717  = ~A good tale is priceless, <CHARNAME> – and I fear this one, dark as it is, could be important.~
@718  = ~I swear that it's worth every coin ye'd pay me.~
@719  = ~Dynaheir! Look, Boo, we found her! Oh, glorious day!~
@720  = ~Now I believe that 'tis truly thee. I would'st never have thought that I would'st be glad to see this... rodent.~
@721  = ~Yes, my witch, it's me! Oh, <CHARNAME>, if you thought that Minsc and Boo and you made a great butt-kicking team, just wait until Dynaheir joins us and unleashes her magic against the evil critters that bar our way!~
@722  = ~C-critters? I'm still b-bleeding from the last one of these "c-critters"!~
@723  = ~C-critters? I thought we were dead for certain, and he calls them c-critters?!~
@724  = ~I can not think of a better name for this scum, warrior.~
@725  = ~The warrior true, fighting to save his lady... Now that their quest is over, <CHARNAME>, perhaps they could join ours?~
@726  = ~I would indeed be honored to serve thee, <CHARNAME>.~
@727  = ~Yeah! Uncle Khalid and Auntie Jaheira are coming with us! This is going to be a great adventure, after all!~
@728  = ~*sigh*~
@729  = ~So the total is - one no-nonsense woman and a dead weight - her husband. *snorts*~
@730  = ~If I were her, I'd hide that weakling somewhere safe, if I really wanted him...~
@731  = ~Must be a druid thing... No woman I know, with half a brain, would waste her time on him.~
@732  = ~The sooner, the better.~
@733  = ~I'd be very careful when dealing with the servants of the Bitch Queen, <CHARNAME>.~
@734  = ~Be cautious, for Umberlee is a capricious and evil deity- much like Lloth. I would expect nothing less from her followers.~
@735  = ~Poor little man, he's as mad as Minsc was before Boo found him. Perhaps we should get him a hamster? That would surely calm him...~
@736  = ~What's that, Boo? ... Yes, I think a chinchilla would do as well. It would match his eyes.~
@737  = ~That's not very nice. You need to turn that frown upside down!~
@738  = ~Or maybe I oughta turn you clouts inside out!~
@739  = ~Eek!~
@740  = ~Don't you 'eek' me, girl.~
@741  = ~So what do you want?~
@742  = ~My condolences, good woman. I... I know how much it hurts to lose your beloved. I wish I could offer you more than words.~
@743  = ~*sob*~
@744  = ~This poor woman's tears make me think that nobody would mourn my passing. A wanderer, misunderstood by all and alien to all, I shall be cut down by a cruel blade while the passionless world looks the other way.~
@745  = ~*She wipes her tears with an edge of her apron.* You poor soul.~
@746  = ~*sniff* Thank you for... taking the trouble to bring me the news.~
@747  = ~Good <DAYNIGHT>.~
@748  = ~Thanks!~
@749  = ~You'll have to get through me first!~
@750  = ~I respect your attitude, dwarf, which is more than I can say for other males. Now let's see how well you can dance to my blade's whistling a bloody nocturne?~
@751  = ~Not bad, <CHARNAME>. I wish I got half that for every man I killed, but a man has to be a freak before he is worth anything. Figures.~
@752  = ~Yes, I would have expected such opulence from these Lathanderites in rewarding us, there is splendour and excessiveness in everything they do, 'tis so out of balance... but all in all, at least they appreciate that a good deed has been done.~
@753  = ~Your help was indeed much appreciated.~
@754  = ~Hey, slow down! It's not like you look any different!~
@755  = ~You insult us, whelp, yet you would not last an hour in the Underdark!~
@756  = ~Ha! Listen to this, guys! The dark-skinned one actually believes in the Underdark!~
@757  = ~Okay. This I gotta see. Err, hear.~
@758  = ~A hellish chicken? I've had a hellish stomach after a poorly cooked chicken hotpot, but this man's talk of, uh, talk, 'tis new to me!~
@759  = ~I'm warning you, go no closer! It's possessed!~
@760  = ~Worry not, <CHARNAME>. Shar will grant me the secrets to overcome the curse.~
@761  = ~I'm afraid not, drow. The poison was ensorcelled to ensure no magics would work against it... The Iron Throne really does want you dead.~
@762  = ~Poisoned? Our adversary is growing desperate, if he turned from honest steel to Talona's accursed brews.~
@763  = ~Oh, whatever. Let's just get down to business.~
@764  = ~Poi... poison? Oh... er... I don't feel well... I think... I think I need to lie down.~
@765  = ~If you want to live, girl, you do what I ask of you.~
@766  = ~*sighs* And you have told me that it was my tender elven stomach. Oh, do not apologize for your mockery. Our deaths will wash away all the petty differences soon enough.~
@767  = ~I can help you, you dolt.~
@768  = ~A little help from you, and the cure is yours.~
@769  = ~A talking, uh... chicken? Oh, my. What, ah, fowl sorcery is this?~
@770  = ~Fowl? *cluck* You've no idea how much I'm *cluck* going to hate these paltry jokes when *cluck* I get out of this!~
@771  = ~Hmm. Paltry jokes, or poultry jokes?~
@772  = ~Gaaaaaah! *cluck*~
@773  = ~Wait! I was just joking with a *chicken*? Oh, my, oh, my...~
@774  = ~How lovely. Now we are saving chickens from big bad wolves. I hear that your earliest heroic deed was bringing an antidote for a cow that was sick to her stomach. Perhaps farming for you would be a more suitable occupation than adventuring, <CHARNAME>. Just think of the many mighty vegetables you'd be able to produce, wielding your magical pitchfork! (I suffer so!)~
@775  = ~*cluck* The wolf! The wolf is coming!~
@776  = ~*cluck*~
@777  = ~Wow. A damsel in distress, and a brave warrior to come rescue her. I wish that would happen to me.~
@778  = ~Actually, no, I don't. I don't mind the brave warrior, as long as he's handsome, but the part about being in danger I could do without.~
@779  = ~Minsc will rescue a nice girl like you, fear not! But now it's glorious Dynaheir that we need to rescue! Onward, friends!~
@780  = ~I don't know who is more stupid - this man who speaks to his hamster, or you for inviting him along. Minsc is strong though and knows his place. Hmmm... that Dynaheir has the same taste in men as I do.~
@781  = ~Strange as your attitude seems, my friend, I have the impression you are a capable fighter for good. Let us go, and help your lady out of her distress!~
@782  = ~Onward!~
@783  = ~Dear lady, we will do our best. And if I may... if a word from a stranger is of any comfort to you - I hope that your husband is well.~
@784  = ~Thank you, my good elf.~
@785  = ~We will seek for signs of your husband, my lady. I hope this will diminish your worries.~
@786  = ~*sigh* Saying "Have I not warned you?" is such a meager consolation, when one faces death.~
@787  = ~Utinu en lokirim! Son of snakes!~
@788  = ~There are too many elves in this mine! Kill him!~
@789  = ~Filthy, vermin-ridden pig spawn! Tempus knows your treachery and will grant me the strength to strike you down!~
@790  = ~Kill them, but leave the big wench to me!~
@791  = ~Kill them! NOW!~
@792  = ~Your words show great wisdom, and hope is restored. Thank Helm we decided to bring this poor soul here.~
@793  = ~*Inclines his head to acknowledge his assent with Ajantis' words.*~
@794  = ~Atonement, not punishment... Thou art a wise man, Nalin. As wise as any Othlor in my land. I trust that thou hast learnt a valuable lesson about justice today, <CHARNAME>.~
@795  = ~Good timin' is everything in the adventurin' profession.~
@796  = ~I like the sound of it not at all! <CHARNAME>, if I were a leader of this tragically weak company, I would have quoted a previous engagement to get us out of witnessing and, Corellon forbid, participating in any kind of experiments set by mad mages.~
@797  = ~The noise can be most infuriating indeed.~
@798  = ~Me own thoughts exactly. I'm doing this city a service, really.~
@799  = ~<CHARNAME> I recognize him now... this... this gnome... he was arrested for... for murdering a mass of innocent children some months ago... thirty-three *innocent* children... ~
@800  = ~*innocent*? Brats, they were all brats.~
@801  = ~Shaman, we but walked through the settlement with our weapons sheathed, when your people attacked us. But we will lower our arms, if you lower yours.~
@802  = ~It's too late. Too many have died. Ursa will kill you for that!~
@803  = ~You will die, iblith.~
@804  = ~Ursa kill you!~
@805  = ~May the gods reward your arrogance with death!~
@806  = ~My death? You are late, then. I have been expecting our meeting every moment of every day since I have left my beautiful Evereska for these barbaric lands. But I suppose my expectations in this matter never counted...~
@807  = ~Then I shall brag that I've killed Death itself on the morrow!~
@808  = ~'Nough already!!! Outta my way! Let me at him! He's driving me insane!!!~
@809  = ~ENOUGH! ENOUGH! YOU'RE DRIVING MINSC MAD! YOU WOULDN'T LIKE MINSC WHEN HE'S MAD!~
@810  = ~Ya better listen to him littl' man. I've seen him tear the heads off of ogres, ya know...~
@811  = ~*gulp* Well, then... ahem... ta-ta, bye-bye, have a nice day and all that!~
@812  = ~The Fist! Again!~
@813  = ~If you still need a hand with destroying bandits in the area, Jessa Vai, my friend has agreed to help me find their lair.~
@814  = ~Good day to you too, Kivan of Shilmista. I will just... let <CHARNAME> in on some... details. With your permission...~
@815  = ~It's good to see you have taken the ranger in your company. He needs the companionship to stay sane. True heart and passionate soul... and such boundless grief. It scares me to see a man burning himself out so quickly. Take care of him, will you?~
@816  = ~I am glad to see that a sensible woman looks after the elf ranger now. True heart and passionate soul... and such boundless grief. It scares me to see a man burning himself out so quickly. Take care of him, will you? And if you want to chat - ale is on me tonight.~
@817  = ~Now, back to business... do you have any questions, <CHARNAME>?~
@818  = ~It's a slam dunk that we did! Every man on Faerun fits this description! *laughs*~
@819  = ~I'm wastin' me time on ye idiots.~
@820  = ~Oh, Minsc knows, Minsc knows! A gnoll! Minsc HATES gnolls! And they smell really bad, too!~
@821  = ~What're ya bellowin' fer? Can't ya speak normally? Made me deaf, did ya.~
@822  = ~A miserable, undignified little errand, but so long as it grants us the chance to battle once more...~
@823  = ~Listen ta tha lady.~
@824  = ~Humiliatin' excuse for a halflin'! Only way *this* hairfoot's losin' a blade is if it's too deep in somethin's ribs to pull out in time.~
@825  = ~Bugger off... just find me sword.~
@826  = ~We will seek for signs of your friend, lad.~
@827  = ~Too often quests like this one end with finding a corpse. Those are evil times, indeed.~
@828  = ~I will not put down my sword, <CHARNAME>! I would rather sheath it in this man's body. Still, if you want to enter the nest of bandits in disguise, I will stay my hand. But do not expect me to keep silent, when we meet Tazok.~
@829  = ~Women do not grow wise by losing their swords, you brain-dead fool. It's men who do. Manhood for wits - I say it's a bargain!~
@830  = ~He has enslaved a Nymph? A foul crime!~
@831  = ~Exactly. Will you help me... put matters right?~
@832  = ~Kidnapping a nymph ought not to be beyond our abilities; especially not with magic as a prize.~
@833  = ~Be wary, <CHARNAME>. I would suggest freeing this nymph, but not to exchange her for a petty reward... the creature's place is amongst her own kin, in nature. Nymphs have very close affinity with nature, and within the walls of the city, they would perish very swiftly.~
@834  = ~The mage does not seek to release the captive nymph, but only to imprison her again? <CHARNAME>, we will do good, if we free the woodland creature and let her flee these men.~
@835  = ~Wow... a nymph? I've read about them in my father's library. Can we go see the nymph, Eldoth? Can we?~
@836  = ~If you wish to gaze upon beauty, a mirror would serve you better than nymphs, my...~
@837  = ~Thhpppt! I know what *I* look like. I want to see a nymph. Now!~
@838  = ~*sighs* Then if, against all reason, <CHARNAME> approves... ~
@839  = ~Will you bring her here?~
@840  = ~<CHARNAME>! Are you deaf? The mage is going to kill the nymph! Will you stand nearby idly? At least try to talk the wretch out of such an evil deed - or her death will be on our hands.~
@841  = ~Perhaps it is ignorance in your actions more than evil intent, <CHARNAME>... but regardless, I will not let this transaction commence. Silvanus demands you will not take that nymph, mage!~
@842  = ~We c-can't let this c-creature be enslaved... or worse! J-Jaheira, I am with you!~
@843  = ~The woodland being will go free.~
@844  = ~I have already taken her. She is mine, now.~
@845  = ~We will surely end up in difficulties with the Watchers for this. And even though I approve of and share the intentions, a library, especially a sacred one as this, is no place for bloodshed.~
@846  = ~He's... got a point.~
@847  = ~Yes, listen to the child and be on your way.~
@848  = ~Money-grabbing urchins! Helping slaves will only slow us down, something I see no need for us to do.~
@849  = ~Please, <PRO_SIRMAAM>... This is our best chance for freedom, we just need your help!~
@850  = ~They keep slaves here?! How can someone be so cruel as to deprive others of fresh air and sunlight? This villainy makes Minsc's fury rise like the ocean! ONWARD, MY FRIENDS, AND LET EVIL BEWARE!~
@851  = ~Thank you, sir. We are glad to have honest men like you champion our cause.~
@852  = ~A daring plan, my friend! <CHARNAME>, we *must* free these people.~
@853  = ~<CHARNAME>, the one who mingles in slavers' affairs is lowering <PRO_HIMHER>self to their shameful station.~
@854  = ~Creep.~
@855  = ~Will you help us?~
@856  = ~Mmgh... so we are looking for a history of the Unicorn Run? With the title like that, it could be a piquant read.~
@857  = ~I once was told a lovely story about hunting unicorns. You see, they say that if you tie a maiden girl to an oaken tree in the forest, a unicorn would come... So that clever fellow talked a virgin into hunting unicorns with him... Good story, that.~
@858  = ~I wonder if that folio tells of something similar.~
@859  = ~*blushes* It is *nothing* of the kind, of course!~
@860  = ~I'm sure we could keep our eyes open, milady.~
@861  = ~Well, thanks!~
@862  = ~I would rather not be in the command of the Flaming Fist, <CHARNAME>.~
@863  = ~This sounds serious, <CHARNAME>! If the second in command of the Flaming Fist is asking for help from 'passers-by', as we might seem, we should listen!~
@864  = ~You are bound to the will of the owner of your shawl?~
@865  = ~Such injustice! I, Garrick, will aid you, fair creature!~
@866  = ~Please! I cannot fight Ogre-Droth on my own, young human!~
@867  = ~Little Garrick? How very cute. But I say, if you get yourself a guard dog, get the one which can bite; a big, strong one. They can fetch and dance on their hind legs, as good as the lap variety and even better at times.~
@868  = ~Garrick is not little! Good thing ya're an actress, not a painter; would have been a problem bein' blind, huh. 'Cause if ya don't see for yourself how tall he is, ya sure are blind!~
@869  = ~Even the most blighted of souls can find love, it would seem. Your love must have been great, for it still to endure now.~
@870  = ~Yes, and... I'd do it all again. It is not his fault he was born like this. I love him still, and I will always.~
@871   = ~He's left you, and you still beg for him? I cannot figure out if that is a sign of your strength or your weakness. Stupidity, most likely. Mysterious Kara-Turian soul, my ass.~
@872  = ~Iron crisis or not, your hideous visage was likely more than enough to break the mirror.~
@873  = ~Nobles should be more worried about how they'll stay alive, when Tiax rules. He tires of noble whining, and Tiax will break more than your mirror, should he see you again! Now, away from your future master, for he has greater matters to pontificate!~
@874  = ~My word! How RUDE! First my mirror breaks, and now I am verbally assaulted by smelly commoners in the streets. What is this city coming to!?~
@875  = ~Oh, my!~
@876  = ~What a ridiculous threat! We are not the helpless merchants you might otherwise encounter here! In fact, we are strong enough to end your condemnable existence!~
@877  = ~It is, but you filth will not have either.~
@878  = ~You and your girl stand no chance against me and my boy. He's the ugly one. Now, that we have been properly introduced, what are you waiting for, <CHARNAME>? Let's kill this scum.~
@879  = ~Now, that's a bounty to my liking! A smart coin for a pleasurable task!~
@880  = ~What crimes against nature would those be, yelling man?~
@881  = ~Hear ye! Hear ye! The mad cleric of Cyric defiles nature! He turned living in the walking corpses and lives with them as they are his family! Fear him!~
@882  = ~<CHARNAME>, that fellow Bassilus - the living one - sounds a bit odd; almost... deranged.~
@883  = ~Hear ye! Hear ye! Here comes the man to straighten him out!~
@884  = ~Well... vertically, perhaps, but yes. He seems to have no respect at all for his handiwork.~
@885  = ~Heh, for me 5,000 gold would be motivation enough to finish him off, if I was an adventurer! Heh, sorry, back to work!~
@886  = ~Hear ye! Hear ye! By order of his Most Radiant of Lathander Kelddath Ormlyr, governor of Beregost, and in the best interest of its peoples-~
@887  = ~You are disgusting, wretch... Kill him, <CHARNAME>. One who begs for his life has no honor. He will betray you to Tazok if you let him go.~
@888  = ~No, I won't, I won't... *under his breath* Harpy!~
@889  = ~Look, he soiled himself! Let's kill him, so there is no chance that this weakling procreates. That's unless his manhood forever remains stuck between his own buttocks, like a mongrel dog's tail, from the fright we'd given him today. *laughs*~
@890  = ~Bitch.~
@891  = ~<CHARNAME>, we must not let this wretch get away, he will surely inform his superiors. It would be advisable if we could... prevent this, somehow...~
@892  = ~Ya all gonna die!~
@893  = ~It's not too, uh, nice just to demand things you want from others, <CHARNAME>.~
@894  = ~<CHARNAME>, magical trinkets are valuable, but men's respect is ever dearer; it cannot be earned by robbing those you have saved of their prized possession. Think on it.~
@895  = ~Someone really needs to give him a clue!~
@896  = ~<CHARNAME> did not betray <PRO_HISHER> father's memory. You are blinded by Sarevok's intrigues, sage.~
@897  = ~<CHARNAME>, I am glad you changed your mind and decided to help that boy!~
@898  = ~Yes, show us the way. We will see what we can do to help you.~
@899  = ~I'm glad ya agreed ta help out, <CHARNAME>. By Mask, I hoped enough times that someone'd bail *me* outta trouble when I was of an age with Varci!~
@900  = ~This way!~
@901  = ~Mine advice is... <CHARNAME>, lend thine ear to this child's plea. 'Tis impossible to look at him without pity.~
@902  = ~I would follow this boy, if only to tell his guardian that it is not fitting to let the child beg for help on the streets.~
@903  = ~Fine words, drow, but be careful not to forget them. I will watch your steps carefully.~
@904  = ~I bet you will, jaluk!~
@905  = ~Yes, it might not be wise to let her wander around, if only for her own safety. And we shall see if helping her was right, after all. If she proves us wrong... well, then I truly pity her.~
@906  = ~Save your pity for our foes!~
@907  = ~That was, well, depressing.~
@908  = ~See the surface elf wilt while underground! Ha! At least the iblith realises the folly of his life.~
@909  = ~A... drow! I am surely dead.~
@910  = ~Hold on! I think we should help them out, but aren't we gonna kill the guards here anyway? Why d'we need to pay him? They'll be free once all the guards here are dead, anyway. I mean, it's not like we have funds to spare, y'know.~
@911  = ~But uhm... they can use it, poor men. *sighs* You're a kind <PRO_MANWOMAN>, that's why I like ya.~
@912  = ~Wow!~
@913  = ~Exactly, my friend. What say ye?~
@914  = ~Perhaps we should. Though such mercy is... infrequent from me, petrification is a terrible fate.~
@915  = ~A bargain at 500 gold!~
@916  = ~FINALLY! I swear, if he said one more thing, I was going to kill him!~
@917  = ~Why does everyone get angry with me? I'm only trying to be friendly!~
@918  = ~Larceny at the Hall of Wonders

We have agreed to steal a 'telescope' for a gnome named Brevlik.  The telescope is located at the Hall of Wonders.  Brevlik will be waiting for us at the Elfsong.~
@919  = ~But justice is served, and the town thanks you.~
@920  = ~Oh, hush.~
@921  = ~Hmf!~
@922  = ~Aiyee!~
@923  = ~Let's see how you like yours.~
@924  = ~How do you feel about being killed by them?~
@925  = ~Yours, you mean.~
@926  = ~Eh?~
@927  = ~It's almost here!~
@928  = ~Ssssh...~
@929  = ~They are!~
@930  = ~That's good to hear!~
@931  = ~Ah, get lost.~
@932  = ~They should.~
@933  = ~Thank you!~
@934  = ~I do not.~
@935  = ~Think of it as rescuing a maiden.~
