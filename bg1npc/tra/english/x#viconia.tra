@1    = ~Among the drow, we have a saying... ssussun pholor dos: brightness upon you. And it's considered a powerful curse. <CHARNAME>, I've told you before that I would go where you wish, so long as you keep me from this accursed sun. I... Truly, I cannot bear its gaze.~
@2    = ~Sorry, Viconia. We can't always travel by night, but I can try to be a bit more accommodating.~
@3    = ~You know, Viconia, if you're going to live on the surface, you're going to have to get used to the sun.~
@4    = ~Could you stop wailing like that? Do you think the rest of us enjoy hearing that?~
@5    = ~I should hope so. If not I will surely wilt under the burning oppression of your... daylight.~
@6    = ~Pfeh, the thought is utterly repulsive to me. I simply don't know if I'll ever feel at home beneath this burning blaze.~
@7    = ~It should come with time. Just stick it out.~
@8    = ~No. Maybe you won't. But either way you've got live with it.~
@9    = ~Cut the melodrama, would you? Suffer more quietly, for the sake of my sanity.~
@10   = ~My apologies. I have overstepped my bounds, it seems. I yet have much to learn about this world of yours...~
@11   = ~I believe there may be wisdom in your words, <CHARNAME>. Though it burns me all the same, perhaps I can grow to tolerate it. I need not be so insufferably weak, in any case.~
@12   = ~Your surface notions of companionship are yet very foreign to me, <CHARNAME>. Your Imoen, for example. I... away from prying ears, I must comment that I truly don't think that, were the decision mine to make, I would bring the girl along, as you have.~
@13   = ~While she has her functions, I'm not of the mind that they are truly worth the trouble of her. Then again, I acknowledge that I am drow, and think differently from you. What is the reasoning, <CHARNAME>? Why do you take the girl along?~
@14   = ~Imoen's much more than a member of the party. She's an old friend.~
@15   = ~Maybe she can be obnoxious, but she's useful enough to outweigh that.~
@16   = ~She's like a sister to me, and there's a devotion there that goes beyond any concerns of how useful or annoying she is.~
@17   = ~It's a good question. I don't know why I do take her along.~
@18   = ~An old friend? Pfeh, truly, <CHARNAME>, do you expect me to believe that you would consider her value to you as a... a "friend", before you would consider her stake in keeping us alive?~
@19   = ~Yes. What's so hard to believe about that?~
@20   = ~Viconia, I care for Imoen. Maybe that's difficult for a drow to understand, but that's how it is.~
@21   = ~Yes, I would. And I won't have you evaluating Imoen like this, or bringing any harm to her.~
@22   = ~Heh, well, not really. ~
@23   = ~I would beg to differ, personally. I don't see her putting forth any contributions worth the strain she puts on my nerves. But you are in charge of this party, <CHARNAME>, and it's your judgment to make in that regard.~
@24   = ~Truly, then? You keep the girl around for her talents?~
@25   = ~Yes. She is a skilled member of this party.~
@26   = ~What more can I say? She does her job well.~
@27   = ~Well, she's not here for her skill alone, I suppose.~
@28   = ~Sister, you say? Devotion? You'll have to understand when I tell you that surface ways do seem utterly foolish.~
@29   = ~In my home, my dalninilen - my sisters, as you say - certainly bore no devotion to me, nor I to them. We were rivals at best, and bitter enemies at worst.~
@30   = ~That was the Underdark. Things are different here.~
@31   = ~Well, Imoen and I aren't like your siblings. We're close friends, and loyal to each other. ~
@32   = ~Don't get any ideas about such competition. I won't have you harming Imoen.~
@33   = ~So you see the foolishness of your ways? Truly, <CHARNAME>, I can see why you might bear... fondness... for the child, but she is more of a liability to us all. Perhaps she should be let go.~
@34   = ~Maybe you're right. I'll think on it.~
@35   = ~No, Viconia. Imoen's staying, and I'll not have you bringing any harm to her.~
@36   = ~Hm. Interesting. This world may not, after all, be so very different from my home than I had once thought.~
@37   = ~What is it, then? What merits your continued acceptance of her?~
@38   = ~...calm yourself, <CHARNAME>. I won't think of harming your girl, so long as none of you would harm me. Feh! Let us move on. Quickly.~
@39   = ~Surface notions are so very peculiar. I am a drow... perhaps I am not meant to understand them. ~
@40   = ~I suppose that I've never offered you the proper thanks, <CHARNAME>, for having rescued me and taken me in as you have. I've been very... thoughtless in that regard.~

@42   = ~You're most welcome, Viconia.~
@43   = ~You're welcome. Just be sure you pull your weight, or you're out.~
@44   = ~Thank me? I've heard of ways the drow might repay debts.~
@45   = ~And if they do not fall, they'll at least tremble. I'm liking you already, drow.~
@46   = ~Welcome? I am welcome. It has a pleasing ring to it, <CHARNAME>.~

@49   = ~*She pauses for a moment, as if the suggestion has caught her off guard. A sigh of disdain escapes her, but by the time her eyes meet <CHARNAME>'s, her expression is taken over by wicked bemusement.*~
@50   = ~Of course. I had forgotten how the surfacers' minds are ever captivated by my kind. Very well, <RACE>, you may have your repayment, if you so wish.~

@53   = ~Viconia, darling, perhaps you've had a bit too much.~
@54   = ~Pfeh, nonsense! I've not felt so empowered since before I left my old home... Where has that jaluk gone?~
@55   = ~He's probably run off in terror like the others. I might have too, had a drow sworn at me and told me she would cut out my tongue. You're losing your knack, dear, perhaps you should sleep this off.~
@56   = ~For his own good, he should run as fast as possible. That one's insolence was intolerable, and I truly will cut out his tongue, should he bring it back here once again.~
@57   = ~I *do* tire of the company of these rivven, Safana. You may be right: I should get some rest.~
@58   = ~Don't forget the hard-earned spoils, now.~
@59   = ~Of course not. Nindolen rivven phuul ji waelen...~
@60   = ~Male, fetch me something to eat.~
@61   = ~My dear, do pipe down. Some of the more civilized members of this party are trying to think. Don't interrupt us with your primitive search for food.~
@62   = ~Were we in the Underdark, you would surely be killed for your arrogance. 'Tis a pity it cannot be so here. All the same, you would do well to watch your tongue, jaluk.~
@63   = ~Yes, yes, whatever you say, my dark little beauty. If you're truly interested in living on the surface, go consult with Skie on knitting or baking cakes or all the other things women love to cluck on about.~
@64   = ~Yes, yes, whatever you say, my dark little beauty. If you're truly interested in living on the surface, perhaps you should take up knitting, or learn to bake. And, most importantly, never talk to a man, unless asked first.~
@65   = ~Pfeh! Be wary, jaluk. I won't be placed in your surface woman's subservience... and I don't take insult lightly.~
@66   = ~Might I be correct, Ajantis, to assume that you have never seen one such as I?~
@67   = ~I have seen all too many of your kind before. I know well the ways of the wicked.~
@68   = ~You insipid fool, I was referring not to my place in your limited moral spectrum, but rather to my being a drow.~
@69   = ~Then the answer is no, though I still know your ways inside and out. You are irredeemably evil, and that will one day be your downfall. It weighs heavily on my heart to know this, but 'tis true all the same.~
@70   = ~Your naivete will be *your* downfall, waela rivvil.~
@71   = ~I see in you a ferocity rivaling that of the yathren I once knew below the surface. Perhaps not all of the rivvil women are weak and fawning.~
@72   = ~You speak to me of battle, drow? 'Tis rather unsettling to me that you see fit to group the talent of a warrior bold with the fearsome tactics of your kindred.~
@73   = ~My words were intended as a compliment, priestess, and were you not so blinded by your hollow surface predeterminations, you might have seen it for such.~
@74   = ~I know you meant good by your words, but I simply cannot draw honor from comparison to such notoriously cowardly ways.~
@75   = ~It seems I may have been foolish in my evaluation of you.~
@76   = ~I observed again the blind fervor with which you approach combat. It is an undeniably strange trait, to bear so much cheerful zeal in such situations.~
@77   = ~All strong warriors revel in the heat of battle. There is nothing nobler.~
@78   = ~You have failed to impart any sense upon the situation, rivvil, though I had not suspected you would. What is so noble to you about warfare? I had thought that most rivven at least feigned belief in the surface moral that slaughter is distasteful.~
@79   = ~On the field of battle, both parties know full well that their lives hang in the balance. They have placed them there willingly. 'Tis a sort of bravery that Tempus smiles upon, as do I.~
@80   = ~And what of... alternatives? What of other ways to settle disputes, outside of warfare?~
@81   = ~None are as virtuous as the valor felt on the battlefield.~
@82   = ~So it seems that the death, the slaughter bothers you not, priestess. But you would still condemn the ways of my kind, I'm sure?~
@83   = ~Cowardice reigns in the dealings of your kind, Viconia. Your games, your cloak-and-dagger... 'tis shameful! Battle, along with victory, is the only righteous end one may strive for!~
@84   = ~Pfeh. I, alternatively, possess a mind, and as such will distance myself as far as possible from your fanatic dogma.~
@85   = ~In a war of virtues, thou art unarmed.~
@86   = ~As are you, rivvil, in a war of wits.~
@87   = ~Do not mock me! 'Tis solely for the continued success of this group that I shall let your insult pass!~
@88   = ~Male! Darthiir!~
@89   = ~Female!~
@90   = ~How dare you to interrupt me!~
@91   = ~Do not talk to me, and you will not be interrupted, drow.~
@92   = ~Why do you constantly avoid speaking with me? Are you afraid? Even the drow cannot kill with words alone, rath'argne darthiir.~
@93   = ~Oh, what an exciting piece of lore! What witticism are you going to bestow on me next? The usual "serve me you shall, jaluk" tune? And a chorus of repetitive insults with intricately woven in drow words, where you could not find an adequately offensive word in Common?~
@94   = ~You would do well to hold your tongue, Coran! I do not take peaceable reaction to insults. If so much as one more word -~
@95   = ~So now you do not wish the "cowardly elf" to speak? Where did the enthusiasm go, I wonder? Viconia, I prefer to do pleasurable things. If I could choose between bathing in the fiery cracks of Nine Hells and associating with you, I would be enjoying a lava bubble bath right now.~
@96   = ~You are one of the few among us whom I can respect.~
@97   = ~Thou art fluent in compliments. Some might say effluent.~
@98   = ~I do not understand your need to spurn me. I only wished to express my admiration for your... strength, your pride. You give me hope yet for these rivven.~
@99   = ~I thank thee for thy kind words. Yet I know 'twould be unwise to not search for the barb that doth likely lie therein.~
@100  = ~I do not blame you for your mistrust. Such things are innately foolish, and the color of my skin does create certain expectations.~
@101  = ~Lend me no justification for them, and all the more of my trust shall be thine.~
@102  = ~I gather, magess, that in your homeland the women are of distinguished position.~
@103  = ~'Tis verily so. The Wychlaran do possess elevated status in Rashemen.~
@104  = ~I might say that I'm very intrigued to think that-~
@105  = ~Hold thy tongue for a moment, drow. I can clearly see the reasons for which though hast approached me with this matter. Think not to draw parallels between my people and yours.~
@106  = ~But they exist, rivvil. I seek not to draw them, but only to make them evident.~
@107  = ~You seek not *only* to make them evident, but also to present them in the light of thy own choosing.~
@108  = ~Thou hast a sharp mind, Viconia, and an equally pointed ambition. Though perhaps not to others, thine motives and machinations are plainly evident to my mind.~
@109  = ~I... I know not what more I can say. You have cornered me, jalil. Well done.~
@110  = ~'Tis not victory I seek! Though you dwell now upon the surface, thy mind still works like that of a drow. Ever busy, busy, busy.~
@111  = ~Waela jaluk! I grow weary of patching you up every time you make a blunder.~
@112  = ~(She speaks as though she does not enjoy the task...) Such is your role in this group, Viconia. I handle most of the battle with my magic, and you serve largely to heal after the fact.~
@113  = ~Feh! You underestimate my contributions to this party, faern.~
@114  = ~You are hardly making all contributions within your... ability. (Though my clever innuendo is likely over this one's head.)~
@115  = ~Mistake me not for some harlot, mageling. Beneath the surface men begged for my company... would hang their lives on the very chance! You jaluken are weak. I have yet to meet one worthy of my submission in such a manner as you suggest, nor shall I ever.~
@116  = ~(Bah! This one has resolve!) Of course, you have never met a Thayvian.~
@117  = ~Until now. And I am unimpressed. Begone, male... and do not address me again, lest I permit it.~
@118  = ~Feh. I will never understand this cursed filth of a surface world. The sprawling hills, the vibrant greens... the endlessly gaping sky and its one burning eye. If it were not for the occasion of darkness, I could not stand it at all.~ [%tutu_var%VICON12]
@119  = ~I have little patience for those like you, vile creature, who would defile nature with their criticisms.~
@120  = ~Are you prepared to defend your fanatic outburst, druid? Tell me just what reasons I have to share your undying love for this world.~
@121  = ~I need give you no reason to love Her. Only know that the Great Mother is the ultimate power behind all things, and that the natural order pervades all civilization and other such works of man.~
@122  = ~You are, like all things, subject to the will of nature. That's all you need to know, drow.~
@123  = ~Vith'os, jalil d'rivvil! I will never submit to this wretched world of yours...~
@124  = ~Garrick, you seek to inspire morale with your songs, do you not?~
@125  = ~Of course I do.~
@126  = ~Then I should probably inform you that you have missed your goal by a terrible margin. My head throbs daily as you croon about glory, love, and heroism.~
@127  = ~I don't know if I really deserve your comments, Viconia... but what would you rather I sing of?~
@128  = ~Of the things my Lady the Nightsinger tells me of. Of something more true to the world we walk through. Your idealistic blatherings are just that, and entirely without substance.~
@129  = ~I can't help but wonder if you know anything beyond pain and depression. I feel very sorry for you.~
@130  = ~Keep your sympathies to yourself, fool, and put any ideas you've gotten about me out of your head. I'll not suffer being the subject of your next lovestruck ballad.~
@131  = ~Child, I don't see why you insist upon shying away from me. Does my race truly repulse you to the point of such avoidance?~
@132  = ~No! Um... well... kinda. I read about the drow back in Candlekeep. Kinda nasty, from what I remember. Aren't all drow out to conquer the world or something? Make slaves of us all?~
@133  = ~It's true that my people in many ways deserve their grim reputation. But keep in mind that I am an outcast of my people, and I bear their ways no loyalty.~
@134  = ~You and I are abbilen, companions. It's a word I could seldom use in the caverns of my home. Perhaps you'll offer me the chance to know the purpose of such a word here, in this world of yours.~
@135  = ~Ah, uhm, you make me feel like such a heel. I can't say you don't still give me just a bit of the heebie-jeebies, but I can say that I'll do my best to give you a chance.~
@136  = ~That is all I would ask of you.~
@137  = ~Stand still, girl. You're wounded.~
@138  = ~There. Do not be such a wael next time, lest you wind up dead.~
@139  = ~Um... thanks, Viconia. Y'know, for the healing and the advice.~
@140  = ~Am I to understand, Imoen, that you and <CHARNAME> grew up in a monastery? It's a sort of childhood I can scarcely even begin to identify with.~
@141  = ~Ah... well, it wasn't that exciting or anything. Stuffy old monks, lotsa dusty tomes. But I guess the most fun probably came from all the trouble we'd get into, or from hangin' around old Puffguts.~
@142  = ~...Puff... guts?~
@143  = ~Yeah! Ol' Puffguts ran the inn there. He was kinda like a father to me. You know, like Gorion was to <CHARNAME>.~
@144  = ~And you referred to your "father" as... Puffguts? I had thought that on the surface the ilharnen - the fathers - actually commanded a good measure of respect?~
@145  = ~Most of 'em do, but Puffguts was different. Real laid-back.~
@146  = ~I suppose that a lack of authority could very well explain your present nature...~
@147  = ~Surface dwellers can be so stupid!..~
@148  = ~As can your ilk, in addition to being notoriously maligned.~
@149  = ~My words were not directed to you, druid, but rather to the idiocy that runs rampant in the masses here.~
@150  = ~Be that as it may, drow, I don't think that you can honestly insist that those on the surface are so much more foolish than your own kin.~
@151  = ~You... speak rather wisely, to my great astonishment.~
@152  = ~Hmph! As if she would be a judge of wisdom...~
@153  = ~Are you sure there is no drow blood in you, Jaheira?~
@154  = ~There's none that I'm aware of. Why do you ask?~
@155  = ~Because you treat your husband exactly as a drow female would her current... lover.~
@156  = ~Bah, do not speak such foolishness, drow.~
@157  = ~I speak only the truth.~
@158  = ~Khalid, my observations of you have sparked some particular curiosities.~
@159  = ~I d-don't know if I should want to hear of them, or not. But d-do speak of them.~
@160  = ~I cannot help but wonder what it might be like to live such a hodgepodge existence. When one's race is not even certain, rivvil or darthiir, I imagine doubt and confusion could become quite consuming.~
@161  = ~I s-sense an insult, Viconia. I am perfectly satisfied with my heritage, I'll th-thank you to note.~
@162  = ~Truly? Then you are a braver sort than I had figured you for.~
@163  = ~...will th-that be all, drow?~
@164  = ~It will. You are dismissed.~
@165  = ~...you would do well to d-dismiss your prejudices. They will serve you no good here. ~
@166  = ~Greetings, darthiir. I know that you look upon me as an enemy, but perhaps we could ignore our differences. I am in need of allies in this world of yours, not enemies.~ [%tutu_var%VICON27]
@167  = ~I see, drow, that you are no exception to the ways of your kindred. This is a vile ploy, a play for power, and it comes so naturally to your wretched heart that you don't even attempt to conceal its manipulative nature.~
@168  = ~Iblith! If that is how you want things, then so be it. I'll waste no more time hoping for a fragile darthiir to see an appeal to reason.~ [%tutu_var%VICON28]
@169  = ~How are we to ever trust one who venerates the Spider Queen? It's a vain pursuit you're engaged in, dark elf.~ [%tutu_var%KIVAN28]
@170  = ~I worship Lolth no longer...~ [%tutu_var%VICON29]
@171  = ~You have forsaken Lloth not for a kinder deity, Viconia. Your conversion means nothing to me. The day one trusts a Dark Elf is the day of one's demise.~
@172  = ~Then keep your distance from me, or that day will approach sooner than you should like!~
@173  = ~Feeble darthiir, how did you keep your life? Deheriana is dead...~
@174  = ~Do not you ever dare to say her name, not you... I... I forbid it!~
@175  = ~If you wouldn't plod along like a half-wit, murmuring Deheriana this and Deheriana that, at every footfall, I would not have asked, but what is one to expect from a frugal darthiir, but foolishness? So, why have you abandoned the female you have served to death, and were not punished for that?~
@176  = ~I did not serve Deheriana, Viconia. She was my wife in the eyes of gods and men. I love her.~
@177  = ~"Jal ssinssrigg zhah waela". All love is foolish, darthiir.~
@178  = ~You do not know what love is, Drow. The very word you used does not mean "love". It means lust.~
@179  = ~There is no word for "love" in Drow.~
@180  = ~There is. Your kin got rid of it thousands of years ago, when they ripped everything good and true from their souls to please the Spider Queen.~
@181  = ~That which does not exist shall not have a name.~
@182  = ~...when I lived beneath the surface, I dealt often with creatures called the svirfneblin. They, much like you-~
@183  = ~Yes, yes. I know all about the svirfneblin, or deep gnomes, as they're often called. Don't bore my superior intellect with your trite explanations, just get to the point!~
@184  = ~I'm beginning to wonder if this is a waste of my breath.~
@185  = ~Of course it is. Your dull mind has very little to contribute to mine.~
@186  = ~Iblith. I was remarking that they, much like you, thought themselves very clever, but when our parties descended upon them their trickery and illusions could only take them so far. Their bodies fell just as easily as any other.~
@187  = ~Oh, so the drow's making threats now? Don't you worry, I'm at least ten times more intelligent and resourceful than the deep gnomes. You'll just see.~
@188  = ~Oloth plynn jal... Shar, why must you make my existence such a mockery?~
@189  = ~Tell me that it is not as it seems, Skie. Do tell me that the jalilen d'rivven -the surface women - aren't as bound to servitude as you appear to be.~
@190  = ~I'm sorry, did I do something wrong?~
@191  = ~Don't play stupid, girl. The way the jaluk pushes you around... It's appaling!~
@192  = ~You don't need to go feeling sorry for me, Viconia. Eldoth loves me, and I love him. I guess if you can't understand this-~
@193  = ~Oh, please, child, don't mistake my irritancy with you for concern. I'm unbearably close to retching, as it is. It would seem to me that your "love" is naught but a word the rivvil males have invented to bind the foolish rivvil women to their servitude.~
@194  = ~No, that's not it at all! It's just sad that you can't understand the way that... ooh, I have a headache!~
@195  = ~Stay clear of her, wench. Her bile will poison your mind, if you let it.~
@196  = ~Tell me that it is not as it seems, Skie. Do tell me that the jalilen d'rivven - the surface women - aren't as bound to servitude as you appear to be.~
@197  = ~Don't play stupid, girl. The way the jaluk pushed you around... It's appaling!~
@198  = ~I can't believe you would say that! *sniffle* Do you need to be so mean all the time?~
@199  = ~In Menzoberranzan we used to hunt your type for sport, yingil. The svirfneblin were not our most powerful enemies, but they wielded powers over the earth that made them challenging prey for the unwary. Have your people any similar powers over stone?~
@200  = ~Tiax has powers over stone, sky, and water, Drow! No element may escape Tiax's relentless domination!~
@201  = ~I did not ask of you, wael, I asked of your people!~
@202  = ~My people!? Tiax has no peers! Tiax has moved beyond his petty heritage and achieved a state far beyond that of even the greatest of Rock Gnomes! No other race may DARE to claim kinship with Tiax, for he is a race unto himself! Let all the world tremble before his might!~
@203  = ~*sigh* I sense that I waste my breath on you. So be it.~
@204  = ~So tell me, darthiir, does your grim outlook on life result from any particular misfortune or merely from the dismal chore of having to live as a surface elf?~
@205  = ~Ugh, must you speak to me, drow? Your presence here alone suggests that our leader is a mad <PRO_MANWOMAN>, and that we're all doomed. Do I have to suffer your prattle, as well?~
@206  = ~That doesn't necessarily answer my question, though it does confirm my suspicions to a degree. I can imagine that such a fragile life always beneath the sun could get depressing.~
@207  = ~Sentiments very similar to how I would hang myself for dismay at having to live my life crawling about in holes. But your current state doesn't give you much room to needlessly harass your companions. That is, unless you find your own doom to be an inviting thing.~
@208  = ~Feh! Waela darthiir! You've made no attempt to conceal your disdain for me, and we would surely be at odds regardless of what I might say to you.~
@209  = ~True. I can imagine your position could get quite depressing.~
@210  = ~I have given some thought, wizard, to the advice you offered me. Addled as you seem, it occurs to me that your words might hold some merit after all.~
@211  = ~Of course they do! Er... just what were they, again?~
@212  = ~I see. I should have expected such a response from you. Your very personage, your every action, is laden with a certain lunatic instability. The present occasion must be no exception. But that is not what-~
@213  = ~Tell me, pretty onyx, have you ever thought of becoming an exotic specimen? I've never seen anything with the quality of your flesh, so redolent of pure Evil within. Why, even in the stories Mummy tells me... not that I see those so often any more. Oh damn my cursed distracted eye!~
@214  = ~What? Have you gone mad, jaluk?!?~
@215  = ~No. Perhaps only an ear? 'Twould make a dazzling specimen; lacquered, set on a stick, it could double as a backscratcher. Benefit us all. And, mind, in that case I would feel less urgency in collecting the rest of you until you're... indisposed.~
@216  = ~And to think, I gave consideration to words from this blathering fool! This one's use is limited to his novelty, it would seem...~
@217  = ~Bah. Such unaspiring timidity. What did you want, then? Something about one nonsense or another?~
@218  = ~You're indeed an unstable sort of creature. Never mind what I wanted of you. It seems I was mistaken.~
@219  = ~Kivan, must you murmur under your breath in such a manner? If there's something you desire to say, then say it. I'll waste no more of my time waiting for you to-~ [VICON99]
@220  = ~What do you want out of me, Viconia?!? My words are kept to myself for the continued good of this party. I respect <CHARNAME>'s leadership, even if I do not respect <PRO_HISHER> decision to harbor you.~
@221  = ~Or would you rather I disregard all of that? I cannot deny that I hear the voice of Shevarash, who calls for me to end your existence. I am running out of reasons to disobey the Black Archer.~
@222  = ~Don't threaten me, Kivan, it shall only lead to your death.~ [%tutu_var%VICON30]
@223  = ~Don't make me warn you again, drow! ~ [%tutu_var%KIVAN30]
@224  = ~Feh! If you were to, for once, act upon one of your hollow threats, I for one would be elated.~
@225  = ~Calm down, both of you! I'll not have you fighting like this.~
@226  = ~Viconia, stop antagonizing Kivan. He didn't ask for any of this.~
@227  = ~Kivan, leave Viconia alone. She doesn't deserve your threats.~
@228  = ~Oh, either settle this, or be quiet! I can't take all of this bickering.~
@229  = ~*say nothing*~
@230  = ~If... if you wish it, <CHARNAME>, it will be done. I can't help but wonder, though, how much longer I'll have to endure this one's insufferable torment!~
@231  = ~<CHARNAME>! You... do you *betray* me? Betray me to this belligerent darthiir?~
@232  = ~I'm not picking sides. You're both going to stop fighting, and that's all.~
@233  = ~You've pushed him far enough, Viconia. You're a divisive force in this group.~
@234  = ~Phew.~
@235  = ~Feh! The darthiir is feebleminded, <CHARNAME>.~
@236  = ~Look, I refuse to pick sides. Just stop fighting, both of you.~
@237  = ~I've had enough of your violent tendencies. I can't abide them any longer.~
@238  = ~Oloth plynn dos, darthiir. Lil alurl! For Shar!~
@239  = ~Then it's true... You have abandoned me. Jal khaless zhah waela. How true it is, and how blind I was to once believe otherwise.~
@240  = ~Cursed was the day I met you, surface scum. Oloth plynn jal! Seek not to pursue me, lest I be tempted to strike in return.~
@241  = ~Feh! The darthiir is mad! As much as I would wish for you to reconsider his presence, <CHARNAME>, I can abide your decision.~
@242  = ~Vith'os, darthiir! It's no better a fate than you deserve!~
@243  = ~The darthiir was mad, <CHARNAME>! It's a relief to us all that he is gone.~
@244  = ~It seems the dark one has her talons in you, after all. It's regrettable, <CHARNAME>, when people I once thought so deserving of my respect have fallen to such lengths. But if that's the way things have become... then I have no choice but to take my leave. I can no longer stand by as this woman poisons your mind.~
@245  = ~Farewell, <CHARNAME>. Beware of the drow...~
@246  = ~<CHARNAME>, this party has been spiraling into its doom for some time now. This is all the confirmation I need of the evils that walk alongside me. The drow has poisoned your minds in addition to her other crimes.~
@247  = ~Stand and face me then, Viconia. My conscience can abide no less than to see to your end.~
@248  = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>. I will say not a word to the drow from now on.~
@249  = ~Are you truly going to fall into her web of deceit? <CHARNAME>, we can no longer trust this one at our backs... plotting and scheming as she's apt to do.~
@250  = ~Viconia... Kivan is right. We can't trust you any longer.~
@251  = ~Look, Kivan, you've harassed her long enough.~
@252  = ~I asked you two not to fight, and I meant it. I'd hate to see this resolved with force.~
@253  = ~The dark elf has laid her snare for you, <CHARNAME>. Don't become her victim.~
@254  = ~No more of your taunts, drow!~
@255  = ~Shevarash, another dark one will not savage the world any longer.~
