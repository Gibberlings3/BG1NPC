@0    = ~So, <CHARNAME>, I was wondering what you thought of my music. Everyone else seems to have an opinion...~
@1    = ~Truly, you are a great bard, Garrick. You have songs and tales for every occasion.~
@2    = ~I'd prefer if you'd just shut up. I find you have little use, beyond carrying my bags.~
@3    = ~Thanks, it, uh, means a lot to hear that! When I write of you, I'll be sure to mention your kindness and good nature.~
@4    = ~No problem.~
@5    = ~Actually, I was lying in the hope you'd shut up sooner.~
@6    = ~Well, maybe Silke wasn't *that* bad a boss after all...~
@7    = ~What a beautiful night. Almost time to call it a day... Uh, Xzar, why are you looking at me like that?~
@8    = ~Tell me a bedtime story, music man! Mummy always told me a bedtime story!~
@9    = ~Serious? You actually want to hear one of my tales?~
@10   = ~I am most surprised by this, too.~
@11   = ~Yes, so I can sleep. Pleeeeeeaase.~
@12   = ~Sure, ok, what do you want a story about?~
@13   = ~Tell me a story with bears and gold. No, something new. Tell me a story with golems.~
@14   = ~Once upon a time there was a golem, named Xzar.~
@15   = ~Did he have a short companion golem?~
@16   = ~Yes, he did, named Montaron, a small chap of less than honest demeanour.~
@17   = ~This better be a good story, else ye might regret it, see?~
@18   = ~I don't like this story!~
@19   = ~What? Why not? What do you want me to tell you a story about, then?~
@20   = ~Story? Why would I want a story from you, crazy little living thing?~
@21   = ~But you just said...~
@22   = ~What what WHAT? Leave me alone, I need my beauty sleep.~
@23   = ~Heh, you need more than that, Xzar.~
@24   = ~You are one strange man, Xzar. You need help. I mean, serious help.~
@25   = ~Do you mean that? You're willing to help me?~
@26   = ~Uh, not me, as such... I'm not qualified in that way, you know...~
@27   = ~I'm sure I'm more than qualified in any department. Though you can count me out, Xzar. I might catch something and be reduced to having the brains of a dwarf!~
@28   = ~Bah! Never fails. Every time someone wants to 'help' me, they're either useless fools like yourself... Though you'd make a better specimen than most, if used fresh...~
@29   = ~Ugh, that doesn't sound too good!~
@30   = ~Or they secretly want to *change* me rather than help!~
@31   = ~I've been trying to change ye since the day we met, but I'm still stuck with ye!~
@32   = ~Well, we're none of us so perfect that some change mightn't do us a bit of good.~
@33   = ~Ach! If you really want to help, sing something to attract mosquitoes - over there!~
@34   = ~So you're, uh, a paladin, sir? That's so heroic! I really admire you.~
@35   = ~I serve the cause of law and good, yes. Such is my duty. Through my strivings I make the world a better place to live in for all noble creatures.~
@36   = ~Whoa, you're just like a real hero out of a book! Perhaps sometime I should write a ballad about you.~
@37   = ~I do not fight evil for personal gain, Garrick.~
@38   = ~True, but your fervor sometimes blinds you to the truth of what should be fought.~
@39   = ~W-well said, dear.~
@40   = ~Though if you would write about me, I would be glad to hear it.~
@41   = ~Alora, don't you think that stealing is, uh, wrong?~
@42   = ~I don't steal, silly. I just like collecting things. What's the use of something being in a stuffy museum, or some noble's jewelry being in a box and never worn?~
@43   = ~Well, I guess you don't hurt anyone.~
@44   = ~Exactly! Wouldn't you rather you and I shared some nice cake and wine I found, than a fat old merchant?~
@45   = ~I suppose...~
@46   = ~And I can definitely concur with that.~
@47   = ~There you go, see. Now stop being a sourpuss and smile!~
@48   = ~Would you permit me to make an observation, my lady?~
@49   = ~Of course, Garrick. Go ahead.~
@50   = ~Well, while being turned to stone, as you were, may not be the best of fun, it sure does make a good story.~
@51   = ~A good story? Maybe we should ask a basilisk or mage to petrify you and see how you like it...~
@52   = ~Well, stone is more resistant to damage than frail flesh, so perhaps it could serve to prolong our otherwise short lives, if used correctly.~
@53   = ~Uh, that's not quite what I had in mind.~
@54   = ~Good. I would far rather be remembered by my many deeds dedicated to Tempus than by my period as a statue.~
@55   = ~Say, Coran, you've led a fairly exciting life to date, haven't you?~
@56   = ~Why, that depends on what you consider exciting, Garrick. I have met people who thought that a trip between Nashkel and Beregost is the adventure of a lifetime.~
@57   = ~Talkin' tae Garrick, laddie, ye're doubtless lookin' at one.~
@58   = ~If intrigue, dangerous escapades and love of beautiful women excite you – then, by all means, I have an exciting life.~
@59   = ~I don't mean any disrespect, sir, but in the tales I've read such daredevil characters like you tend to eventually bite off more than they can chew.~
@60   = ~He who does not risk does not drink sweet wines, Garrick. And I hate sour wines and bitter ales.~
@61   = ~Well, I'd try not to run into any more troubles, for all our sakes...~
@62   = ~Yes, we put ourselves through more than enough peril as it is.~
@63   = ~Are you afraid to live to the fullest? I think our company is quite capable of taking on any challenge. As am I.~
@64   = ~I hope so. And Coran?~
@65   = ~Yes?~
@66   = ~Could you maybe, uh, let me in on some of the lines you use on women sometime? Purely, uh, for story purposes, of course...~
@67   = ~Ah, but there is no one way, Garrick. Every woman is a gem that sparkles the brightest when turned at a particular angle to the light.~
@68   = ~If you want to know what a woman is like, do not listen to her, merely look at her and you will never run out of things to say.~
@69   = ~Ah, but Garrick, you should have asked earlier! My mind is now on pleasing only one lady - the fair Namara.~
@70   = ~There are many, Garrick. But trust me the only sure way is this... *Coran shakes his money pouch.*~
@71   = ~You must be pretty important to have such a big bodyguard as Minsc, lady Dynaheir.~
@72   = ~He is proving himself on his dajemma, young one, as he must.~
@73   = ~By protecting Dynaheir and smiting evil wherever Boo smells it!~
@74   = ~Yes, adventuring throughout the Realms in search of knowledge. A worthy pursuit.~
@75   = ~I must admit thou seemst at times a trifle naïve, Garrick, though your heart is in the right place at least.~
@76   = ~Thanks, good lady. You know I'll help you, if I can.~
@77   = ~I fear the Prophecies of Alaundo are more cryptic than you think, Garrick. Though I appreciate the gesture. Thou art a good man.~
@78   = ~You're quite an impressive spellcaster, if I may say so, sir.~
@79   = ~(This fool is addressing me again. What is it now? I may have to cast a silence spell sometime on that one.) Yes, yes, I know. What is it you want?~
@80   = ~Well, I have a little arcane skill, but yours is amazing! I was thinking, maybe you could tell me a little about your studies? It could make a great tale.~
@81   = ~(The simian wants me to divulge my secrets? Does he take me for some kind of idiot?) I am a Red Wizard of Thay, boy, a true magician. We do not share our methods with outsiders. Your parlour tricks are a far cry from my arcane master. (Yes, that was good. Must remember to use it again.)~
@82   = ~I wouldn't bother to ask me for my secrets either, Garrick. More than likely you'd miscast and kill us all painfully.~
@83   = ~Uh, sorry, sir. I was just asking.~
@84   = ~Well, in the future... don't. (Why this child follows us, I do not know. He would better serve me as a human shield. Yes, another good idea.)~
@85   = ~Don't you ever want to make music about happy things, Eldoth? I could teach you some of my songs, if you like. I was trained in Berdusk, you know.~
@86   = ~Ah, the naïve would-be bard speaks. You don't know anything of the real world, and your playing I find sloppy and with a distinct lack of technique.~
@87   = ~That's a bit unfair. I was just trying to be friendly. I had hoped we could, well, exchange songs and tales of adventure...~
@88   = ~Ha, there is nothing I could learn from you. What are your tales of adventure? Drinking a pint of ale for the first time perhaps? You wouldn't last a minute in the real world without us adults at your back.~
@89   = ~Why do you say these things? You're so mean!~
@90   = ~Don't listen tae him, Garrick. He's just jealous ye've got talent.~
@91   = ~Don't speak to me, then, if your childish mind can't hack the truth.~
@92   = ~Fine.~
@93   = ~I've begun a tale of the adventures we've shared with <CHARNAME>. Would you like to play it through with me?~
@94   = ~I very much doubt it is worth hearing. I don't know why <CHARNAME> keeps a whelp like you around, when there is a *true* musician in the party.~
@95   = ~Oh yeah? Perhaps it's because I'm nice, I'm friendly, and everyone else appreciates my music.~
@96   = ~No, I know why it is. Pity. You're excess baggage, you just don't realize it.~
@97   = ~That's how I feel about both of you, fools. If you sang *my* praises more often, on the other hand...~
@98   = ~That's not true! I'm going to talk to the others. They care about me, no matter what you say.~
@99   = ~Faldorn, in the tales I've heard of Shadow Druids, it always seems that they are the, uh, branch, if you forgive the pun, who cause problems.~
@100  = ~Even among druids, this is often seen to be the case.~
@101  = ~Grrr! Those who destroy nature cause problems. The Shadow Druids do what's necessary to restore the balance.~
@102  = ~But it seems to me as if you often see mankind as the enemy. Why is that?~
@103  = ~Man is one of nature's children, though often he forgets it. At such times, nature acts through us to give him a reminder of this.~
@104  = ~Uh, I see...~
@105  = ~I'm not sure you do. You are a townling, after all!~
@106  = ~So are you going to, uh, feel compelled to 'remind' any of us?~
@107  = ~During our travels I have seen that you are not despoiling nature, so you are safe from her wrath.~
@108  = ~Well, that's one less thing to worry about.~
@109  = ~Well, thanks, I guess.~
@110  = ~There is no need to thank me. I live to uphold the balance and protect nature.~
@111  = ~Ok, whatever. Sometimes I just don't understand druids...~
@112  = ~'Roses are the flowers of love...' *sighs* - Done to death.~
@113  = ~Let's try 'Poppies grow where the blood was spilled...' - Again, done endlessly.~
@114  = ~Hmmm, 'Daffodils are self-centered as the famed beauties, which...' - More than common enough.~
@115  = ~Faldorn, isn't there at least one gentle flower that does not have a song about it already? One flower is all I want! Is that so much to ask?~
@116  = ~Sune's Slippers.~
@117  = ~Sune's Slippers? Well, I guess I should count myself lucky that it wasn't Cyric's Bath-towel!~
@118  = ~When Tiax rules, everyone will plant Cyric's Bath-towels in large, moon-shaped beds...~
@119  = ~Tiax, I just made it up!~
@120  = ~Tiax will name every flower after Cyric!~
@121  = ~I can hardly imagine myself at the bard's tourney singing a song about Sune's Slippers! Should have known better than asking your advice, Faldorn...~
@122  = ~Here, look... I said *look*, hands off! Those are Sune's Slippers. They are relatively common. See how the petals are shaped as if they just embraced the foot of a goddess?~
@123  = ~Oh my... Maybe there is something in it after all... Ok: 'I put Sune's Slippers at my Lady's feet. Oh, wonder! They were a perfect fit.'~
@124  = ~An elegant turn of phrase, bard, I will admit that. A good choice of flower, Faldorn.~
@125  = ~Faldorn, what else does your lore tell of these Sune's Slippers? I need more inspiration.~
@126  = ~Well, it has a well-known medicinal effect...~
@127  = ~Oh, please, tell me they soothe heartache! That would be so elegant...~
@128  = ~Nay, not heartaches. Diarrhea.~
@129  = ~Well, less elegant, but I'm sure I can work with it. Thanks, Faldorn.~
@130  = ~Don't thank me, thank Nature.~
@131  = ~Uh, ok. Thanks, Nature!~
@132  = ~Imoen, you know in great tales the focus is always, uh, on the actions of one person?~
@133  = ~Yeah, I guess. So what?~
@134  = ~Well, we're going around doing these great things and all, but sort of in the name of <CHARNAME>. You two have known each other forever. Does it seem odd to you that *<CHARNAME>* is the one in the limelight?~
@135  = ~Well, not really. We're close, so it doesn't matter. And friends like you know it's really the beautiful and wonderful Imoen that saves the day, isn't it?~
@136  = ~Ah, you're great, Imoen. You can always put a smile on my face.~
@137  = ~Just remember to include the words 'beautiful' and 'wonderful' when you write me into <CHARNAME>'s saga.~
@138  = ~Hey, and me too!~
@139  = ~And don't forget me!~
@140  = ~No problem!~
@141  = ~I've heard a lot about the Harpers, Jaheira. Would you mind telling me a bit about how you and Khalid got involved with them?~
@142  = ~Yes, I would mind. Such things are not for the ears of young minds like yours.~
@143  = ~Do not forget, Garrick, that as a druid she has a duty to Nature too.~
@144  = ~Well, I'd heard many Harper agents are bards, like myself. It sounds so romantic, to be a dashing hero, saving the world from evil.~
@145  = ~I d-do believe that was a compliment. Th-thank you!~
@146  = ~Bards many may be, Garrick, though not like you.~
@147  = ~You don't have to be so rude, you know?~
@148  = ~I am sorry, I do not mean to be rude. You are too young to understand the realities and dangers of the world we live in. Maybe when you have seen more of the world, you will come to understand this.~
@149  = ~I have read books and heard tales!~
@150  = ~That is not the same. In a way, I envy your youth and innocence... But you must be careful, there are those who would take advantage of it.~
@151  = ~I suppose you're right, Jaheira. I appreciate the honesty.~
@152  = ~Don't worry. I'm sure in the company of <CHARNAME>, Khalid and I, we will turn you into a fine young man.~
@153  = ~Yes, we shall c-certainly endeavour to do our b-best.~
@154  = ~That's good of you to say. I think I can learn a lot from you all.~
@155  = ~Yes, but enough chatter for now. Time to move onward.~
@156  = ~I've heard that all dwarfs lust for wealth, Kagain, but didn't realise the truth in it, until I met you.~
@157  = ~Be that a compliment, manling, or an insult?~
@158  = ~Uh, well, neither, I guess. Just an observation.~
@159  = ~Well ye best keep yer observations to yerself in future, lest me axe 'observes' ye.~
@160  = ~I've made similar threats in the past, though he conveniently forgets...~
@161  = ~Ye be a poor excuse for a dwarf, Kagain, and should mind yer manners.~
@162  = ~Uh, sorry Kagain, sir.~
@163  = ~Quiet now, I've no interest in ye chatter. Got to be gettin' back tae countin' me gold.~
@164  = ~Ah, seems I was right...~
@165  = ~I've heard many tales of the skill of elven warriors, Khalid.~
@166  = ~And so you should have.~
@167  = ~Ha! You weak surfacers have nothing on the might of the Drow in battle.~
@168  = ~Y-yes, our-~
@169  = ~What?~
@170  = ~I was g-going to say-~
@171  = ~Excuse me?~
@172  = ~W-well-~
@173  = ~You were saying something?~
@174  = ~Never mind.~
@175  = ~Ah, I'm sorry, Khalid... I didn't mean to upset you, I was just joking around.~
@176  = ~Well, o-ok then, I suppose.~
@177  = ~Neither my husband nor myself really appreciate this teasing, Garrick.~
@178  = ~Kivan, an archer with aim true, driven by a desire for vengeance for his murdered love.~
@179  = ~Humans, and human bards in particular, have the most peculiar notion that they can tell others what and who they are.~
@180  = ~Uh, yeah. Was I talking out loud? I was just taking notes for my tales...~
@181  = ~I have no interest in seeing my name in tales, Garrick. I hope that you will respect my wish.~
@182  = ~Well, that's a relief... So there'll be more space for the worthy party members. Like me.~
@183  = ~You are a man of few words, aren't you?~
@184  = ~Yes.~
@185  = ~I'm sorry, Kivan. I know you've had a hard time in life, and I hope in the future you'll be able to smile again.~
@186  = ~Our life, Garrick, is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the number of moments which took our breath away. Remember that.~
@187  = ~I'm not familiar with rangers carrying around hamsters, Minsc.~
@188  = ~Oh, but you forget Boo is not just a hamster. He is a Miniature Giant Space Hamster! And he provides me with guidance.~
@189  = ~Ooh, Space Hamsters! So delicious in soup...~
@190  = ~So he's the brains of the outfit?~
@191  = ~Well, of course, Dynaheir is in charge. But Boo is a close second.~
@192  = ~Evidently...~
@193  = ~Boo wants to know if you are mocking me, small man!~
@194  = ~Of course not, sir, I merely wanted to know more about you.~
@195  = ~Ok, I believe you. But Boo is keeping an eye on you!~
@196  = ~Why are you always so mean about me? I had thought halflings were known for their kindness.~
@197  = ~Ye be a useless whelp, more of a liability than an asset to the party. And don't be comparin' me to me kin, either.~
@198  = ~You don't have to like me. I'd just appreciate it if you'd keep your comments to yourself. I was always taught: if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.~
@199  = ~Yer teacher was a fool.~
@200  = ~I think the quality of his music says that well enough...~
@201  = ~That's not very fair. I try not to be rude to you, though I could be!~
@202  = ~Watch yer tongue, boy, else ye might wake up without it. Or not at all. And where would that leave yer singin'?~
@203  = ~I don't think I have anything more to say to you.~
@204  = ~As well ye shouldn't. Now scram!~
@205  = ~You're looking fairly pensive there, Quayle. Is something up?~
@206  = ~Me? No, boy, I'm merely contemplating, uh, the Theory of Relativity. Yeah. It's very complex, you see...~
@207  = ~Oh, yeah? I've picked up a fair bit of lore in my time. What's it about?~
@208  = ~I'm sure you wouldn't understand.~
@209  = ~You're always like this! Go on, try me.~
@210  = ~Well, it's, um... Let's see. It's a theory you can only tell your relatives. So, I'm very sorry, but I can't explain it to you.~
@211  = ~I can't help but feel that's a bit of a cop out, Quayle.~
@212  = ~Ha! For once I agree with you, Garrick. This simple gnome is not quite as much of a genius as he believes he is. Not compared to one such as I.~
@213  = ~Woe is me, the youth of today, so untrusting. Of course it's more complex than that! But you need years of intense intellectual stimulation to even *begin* to be able to comprehend it.~
@214  = ~Yeah, whatever.~
@215  = ~Would you tell me some stories of your life, Safana?~
@216  = ~Hmmm? Why, yes, certainly, Garrick. Could you just fetch me my wineskin?~
@217  = ~Why, of course, miss.~
@218  = ~Thank you, my dear man. Oh, dear. I appear to have run out. May I have some of yours? I am *ever* so thirsty...~
@219  = ~Sure, here you go.~
@220  = ~Mmm, thanks...~
@221  = ~So, would you tell me a little about yourself?~
@222  = ~Another time, Garrick. I'm tired right now. Would you perhaps carry my pack awhile? Don't worry, I'll be sure to give you my undivided attention later.~
@223  = ~Uh, ok. (Why do I get the feeling I'm being used?)~
@224  = ~Aww, poor Garrick, such a nice guy, but you can be such a fool...~
@225  = ~That's an interesting name you have, Shar-Teel. Where does it come from?~
@226  = ~I've no desire to discuss such things with you, male.~
@227  = ~Hey, how come you're always so hostile to us men?~
@228  = ~I say again, I have no desire to discuss such things with you.~
@229  = ~And I don't really want to find out. I suspect it is rather depressing.~
@230  = ~You're so bitter about something. Open up to me, please, I'd like to help...~
@231  = ~Men are inferior. In this way, you are a prime example.~
@232  = ~Well, talk about 'that time of the month'. But it seems with her it's that time of the month every day...~
@233  = ~And so another day of adventure draws to a close. Say, would anyone care to hear my latest composition?~
@234  = ~No.~
@235  = ~Aye, and I can second that!~
@236  = ~Err... a rather abrupt decision, wouldn't you say, my lady? I've been working on it for the past several days, and it's one of my finest. If I do say so myself.~
@237  = ~No. And call me 'lady' again, and I'll cram that instrument where Lathander's rays don't shine. All I want is peace and quiet; my muscles ache, my head hurts, and the last thing I want to hear are your feeble warblings.~
@238  = ~But certainly Skie wishes to hear my music! Don't you, Skie?~
@239  = ~I'd love to hear your song, Garrick.~
@240  = ~Ah, I knew there was a music lover in this group! Alright, then, this one is dedicated to you, my dear Skie...~
@241  = ~Ah, but music has powers to soothe even the most savage beast! This one is dedicated to you, my dear Shar-Teel...~
@242  = ~Did I not make myself clear, male?!? There is to be *no music*. Should I hear even a single note, I'll make violin strings out of your vocal cords. Do we understand each other?~
@243  = ~*gulp* Uh, yes, my la... Errr, ma'am. I'll just go play my composition over there. In the corner.~
@244  = ~Skie, I...~
@245  = ~Well, uh, I just wanted to say I...~
@246  = ~Ha, the whelp cannot even get his words out.~
@247  = ~You wanted to say what?~
@248  = ~I... I think your hair looks very nice today. Yes, that's what I was going to say.~
@249  = ~Oh, thanks, Garrick. You're a sweet young man.~
@250  = ~You really think that? Thank you, Skie, that makes my day.~
@251  = ~Ah, what a grand day to be adventuring! The birds are chirping, the air is fresh and clear, the trees are tall and majestic. What more could we humble mortals ask from the Gods than to be alive on such a day?~
@252  = ~Tiax could ask for a great deal more; for example, Tiax could ask that his destiny be fulfilled, and that he be allowed to bestride the world with his power and glory!~
@253  = ~Oh, why must this idiot continue to trail around with us? Why am I surrounded by such cretins as this?!?~
@254  = ~Tiax could ask that Cyric slay his enemies and lay waste to the faithless, bringing pain and misery to all those fools who do not bend knee to Tiax's might!~
@255  = ~Remind me to emigrate before that happens.~
@256  = ~You know, Tiax, I really think you should see a mental health specialist or something, y'know? You're giving us gnomes a bad name, you buffoon!~
@257  = ~Tiax could ask that Cyric remove these flies that keep getting in Tiax's face! Tiax has *many* demands, and Tiax awaits their fulfillment with eagerness...~
@258  = ~He wasn't even paying attention to me! Someday they'll appreciate my genius. It's not my fault I'm before my time.~
@259  = ~Tiax, you need to relax and enjoy life more. There are simple pleasures far greater than world conquest could grant; the fragrance of a flower, or perhaps the soothing sound of a harp being played.~
@260  = ~Tiax has no time for such pettiness. He dreams of *grander* things! When Tiax rules, he shall enjoy every minute he sacks and destroys disobedient kingdoms and annihilates those faithless who dare to provoke his wrath!~
@261  = ~I mean, maybe I should talk to myself. I'm the only one capable of appreciating my wit and intellect, after all.~
@262  = ~Tiax needs no flowers; the sweet smell of the rivers of blood, which will flow when he conquers all, shall please him far more! All hail Tiax, ruler of all things!~
@263  = ~Uh, ok...~
@264  = ~Sometimes I think I'm invisible. Hey, I'm not using my amazing illusionary powers again, am I? No? They must just be ignoring me, then. Shame I can't think down to their level.~
@265  = ~Uh, Tiax...~
@266  = ~Did Tiax permit you to address him?~
@267  = ~Well, no, but...~
@268  = ~Then silence, mortal! Tiax has no time to waste in discussion with fools like yourself.~
@269  = ~Though Tiax wastes a lot of time talking to himself. Fuzzy logic there...~
@270  = ~I was just...~
@271  = ~And don't start with your songs, either. Tiax has a headache from his pipe-weed, and does not desire the additional burden of your racket.~
@272  = ~For once, Tiax, we agree. It really is a most dire and unskilled racket.~
@273  = ~Uh, sorry.~
@274  = ~Tiax hears your apology, though he cares not for it. Away with you! ~
@275  = ~Do the drow make music, Viconia?~
@276  = ~We have no need of such music as yours, rivvin. It is weak and worthless, just like everything else about you.~
@277  = ~That's not true. Music can inspire great feelings, love, happiness, and peace. It is far from worthless.~
@278  = ~You only sing of such pathetic sentiments. Where are your songs of conquest, war and destruction?~
@279  = ~This drow scum is not even worth bothering with, Garrick. Save your breath.~
@280  = ~We do have such songs, though I... I prefer not to sing them.~
@281  = ~And why not?~
@282  = ~I seek to please with my music, and raise the spirits of others.~
@283  = ~Well, you do not please me. I find your music not even deserving of pity. You and your songs would not last a day in the Underdark.~
@284  = ~Heh, I share your feelings about his music, Viconia. He is an insufferable fool.~
@285  = ~I count your worthless efforts with as much contempt as his, iblith.~
@286  = ~I'm sorry you feel that way, Viconia. I think as you spend more time above ground, you'll come to appreciate our way of life more. There's a lot to be gained from happiness, love and trust.~
@287  = ~Do not presume to judge me, surfacer. You are a fool to compare my way of life with yours.~
@288  = ~Truly, life is glorious...~
@289  = ~You so often make that remark, yet I fail to see what is so glorious about it.~
@290  = ~Come on, look around! The birds are singing, the sun is shining! There is so much beauty in the outside world.~
@291  = ~Yes, along with all the wolves, ogres, hobgoblins, bugbears and countless other monsters out there trying to kill us.~
@292  = ~Yes, that is glorious indeed! Minsc and Boo shall smite them all! Right, Boo?~
@293  = ~Oh Xan, you're such a pessimist. Look around. Doesn't it make you happy to see such a beautiful day?~
@294  = ~I fail to see what is so uplifting about being endlessly chased around the Sword Coast by hordes of enemies, attempting to end our lives.~
@295  = ~Actually, ending lives is a good thing in some cases. You know, survival of the fittest and stuff. Not mine of course, I'm far too important to the gnomish gene pool.~
@296  = ~Though, yes, when our end comes, as it is inevitable, I suppose it'd be better if we met it under the sun than in a dark cave somewhere.~
@297  = ~Shar's dark embrace is much more welcoming than this infernal sunlight.~
@298  = ~Well, uh, that wasn't what I meant. But I guess it's a start...~
@299  = ~How's it going, Xan?~
@300  = ~Well, I wasn't feeling particularly bad. Though, now that you've started speaking, it probably means you're going to sing a song or something, which probably means I'm going to get a headache. So not so good after all, really.~
@301  = ~Does my music offend you that much?!?~
@302  = ~Not the music, I suppose. Just the noise itself, which brings the added gift of alerting anyone within a mile to our presence and giving him or her ample opportunity to plot our demise.~
@303  = ~And let them come! With Helm as my guide, we shall defeat all such wickedness!~
@304  = ~Oh.~
@305  = ~And when the music stops, it means we're camping for the night, so they know it's time to come and slit our throats in the dark.~
@306  = ~If it gets that bad, some of us might not even wait until night, aye?~
@307  = ~Xan, you really are quite pessimistic, you know...~
@308  = ~I prefer the term 'realist'. Not that it matters, it doesn't make a difference when you're dead.~
@309  = ~Dead? Did someone mention death? Montaron, what's going on?~
@310  = ~Great, now he's started too... I wish I could just lay down and die.~
@311  = ~What are those songs I hear you sing, Yeslick?~
@312  = ~They be war chants, praises to me god, Clangeddin Silverbeard.~
@313  = ~Not as pious as the Ever-Seeing Helm, but a valourous god nonetheless.~
@314  = ~Would you tell me a little about him? I had not heard of Clangeddin, until we met you.~
@315  = ~The Lord of the Twin Axes be the great Dwarven god of battle. He grants me me spells, and I sing his praises as he helps me cleave in the skulls of goblins. Our kind have many such tales and ballads of our gods and warriors.~
@316  = ~I'd like to hear some of them sometime, if I may.~
@317  = ~And I'd like *not* to hear them anytime, if I may.~
@318  = ~Of course, Garrick, me friend, nothing would make this old dwarf more proud than to sing the praises of Clangeddin Silverbeard to a young and eager man as yerself.~
@319  = ~Heh, you're welcome, Yeslick.~
