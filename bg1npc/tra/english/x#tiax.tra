@0    = ~This group moves too slowly! Tiax wishes to dominate the world in THIS lifetime, and yet all his slaves do is obsess over defeating some petty merchant group! Tiax has greater concerns to worry about than whether some fat noble gets his shipment of Maztican spices on time!~
@1    = ~Don't worry, Tiax. You'll dominate the world on schedule, I assure you.~
@2    = ~Tiax, you can't dominate the world. You should know that by now. And we're not your slaves.~
@3    = ~The Iron Throne is involved in a little more than spices, Tiax...~
@4    = ~Quit your whining. You're here because you're useful; cease to be so, and I'll gut you like a fish.~
@5    = ~Tiax supposes you're correct. Nothing short of Cyric himself can even delay Tiax's destiny! If you're all moving at the pace of snails, it must be because Tiax's destiny is closer at hand than ever, and Cyric sees no need to rush! Onward, lackeys, to Tiax's glory!~
@6    = ~You dare deny the will of Tiax!?! Tiax will never understand why Cyric deemed it necessary to saddle him with dullards and fools who can't even understand that Tiax is DESTINED to rule! If they had not been divinely sent by Cyric to aid his world conquest, Tiax would begin to wonder if he was with the right slaves!~
@7    = ~Like I just said, we're NOT slaves. Stop calling us that.~
@8    = ~*sigh* Whatever. We'll get to your "world domination", but not now.~
@9    = ~Enough prattle. Get back in line with the others, or I'll run you through.~
@10   = ~Yes, yes, Tiax knows. Tiax is sure whatever this group is involved with is very important to bugs such as you, but the future lord of all has bigger fish to fry! Tiax does as ye will for the moment, but when the time comes, you had best be prepared to set aside these petty matters and aid Tiax in his conquest of all!~
@11   = ~You THREATEN Tiax!?! Surely you are the most brain-dead slave that Tiax has ever been saddled with! You've earned yourself a week on the whipping post when Tiax rules, but for now Tiax will put aside your foolishness and allow you to keep serving him.~
@12   = ~Sorry, Tiax. My temper got the best of me. You're too amusing to kill.~
@13   = ~That's it. I've had enough of your idiocy, you little...~
@14   = ~Tiax can't believe his ears! His servants, resenting their endless servitude to the future ruler of all!? The day will come when his slaves will rejoice at being able to sacrifice their meaningless lives for his glory, but for now Tiax must suffer such rebellions against his rule. Proper discipline will be meted out... when the time is right. But for now, you are to be spared, my faithful lackeys!~
@15   = ~*sigh* Whatever. We'll get to your "world domination", but not right now.~
@16   = ~I said NOT to call us slaves. I think it's time for you to leave the group, Tiax.~
@17   = ~Tiax, amusing!? Surely ye've lost whatever sense you may have had left, but Tiax is still pleased that his faithful lackeys have not deserted him. Onward, to Tiax's glory!~
@18   = ~What?! You galley-whipped short-knickers! Tiax the grand will not stand to be cast aside! He shall ascend without your bumbling sneakery! The Great Tiax, betrayed on all sides by those seeking to undermine his coming rule, casts aside the refuse he once called his slaves! Mindless fools! Breathe deep and fill your ill-fated lungs with the salty airs of your sorry destiny!~
@19   = ~Yes, yes, the all-seeing Tiax thinks that his leaving would be best. He must finalize his stratagems and consult in secret with Cyric. You shall, of course, meet the Great Tiax again, at which point I will make my grand ascension and appoint you to your rightful place as whipper of the slaves and faithless.~
@20   = ~Tiax has noted your claim to leadership of this group, <CHARNAME>, and has allowed it to continue, because it amuses him. The petty conceits of the enslaved delight both Cyric and his favored, and you show enlightenment in your willingness to do anything to serve Tiax's interests, no matter how horrific or vile! Since you show such skill in the task Tiax has assigned you, when Tiax at last rules all he perhaps might allow you to become head of his palace guard... or head of his bootshining squad, whichever you prefer.~
@21   = ~Ummm... thanks, Tiax. I guess.~
@22   = ~So my options are leader of your personal guard... or boot shining? You really are nuts, aren't you?.~
@23   = ~My methods are only horrific and vile to the spineless, weak-minded jellyfish of the world. Other refer to them as "enlightened."~
@24   = ~Back in line. I don't have time to chatter with the monster fodder.~
@25   = ~Onward, my faithful servant! Destiny fast approaches, and when it arrives, you'll find your loyalty well-rewarded indeed! The cowardly and faithless will tremble before the might of Tiax's mailed fist, and you shall be the instrument by which his enemies are undone! There will be much wailing and gnashing of teeth when <CHARNAME>, Hammer of Tiax, arrives upon the scene! But for now, Tiax's feet are sore, so can we stop for a minute?~
@26   = ~Is Tiax insane? Or is Tiax the only sane creature you know!? Ponder THAT, oh faithless one! Oh, and by the way, you just earned yourself latrine duty for a year, when Tiax rules.~
@27   = ~Enlightened words indeed! There is no evil, save defiance of Tiax's will! There is no good, save that which Tiax desires! Tiax's will be done...~
@28   = ~Five hundred lashes on the whipping post, when Tiax rules!~
@29   = ~Tiax has noted your claim to leadership of this group, <CHARNAME>, and has allowed it to continue as long as he has because it amuses him. The petty conceits of the enslaved delight both Cyric and his favored, and yet here Tiax's generosity is spurned by foolish do-gooders. As Tiax prepares to assume his role as Master of All Life and Slayer of the Faithless, you're busy helping old ladies across the street and saving kittens from trees! Well, Tiax has had enough! Tiax shall find new, more fitting slaves! Pray that the day you meet Tiax again does not come soon, for when it does you shall beg for his mercy... and find none!.~
@30   = ~Ummm, Tiax...~
@31   = ~Good riddance!~
@32   = ~I've had enough of your vileness, gnome. Defend yourself!~
@33   = ~When Tiax's minions flock to his banner and the skies darken with an endless multitude of dragons come at his command, you shall regret ever having spurned him. Prepare yourself for the day when we meet again, but for now Tiax has had enough of these weaklings!~
@34   = ~Mindless fool! Breathe deep and fill your ill-fated lungs with the salty airs of your sorry destiny!~
@35   = ~<CHARNAME>, Tiax has had a further revelation!~
@36   = ~*sigh* What is it this time?~
@37   = ~Do tell me. I haven’t had a good laugh since your last vision.~
@38   = ~Shut up!~
@39   = ~Tiax understands your reluctance to hear, for it bodes you ill, indeed. Tiax has pondered why it has been his lot to follow you willy-nilly into holes, pursuant to your inane concerns. Such behavior does not become the dignity of the Chosen of Cyric! But now! Now, Tiax knows! Now, Tiax has seen...~
@40   = ~And so *now* you will talk. Get on with it, then.~
@41   = ~*sigh* I have no time for it.~
@42   = ~You mock now. You will not when you have heard! Tiax has pondered why it has been his lot to follow you willy-nilly into holes, pursuant to your inane concerns. Such behavior does not become the dignity of the Chosen of Cyric! But now! Now, Tiax knows! Now, Tiax has seen...~
@43   = ~No! Tiax will speak and you will hear for you are involved most of all – except for the mighty Tiax, of course! Tiax has pondered why it has been his lot to follow you willy-nilly into holes, pursuant to your inane concerns. Such behavior does not become the dignity of the Chosen of Cyric! But now! Now, Tiax knows! Now, Tiax has seen...~
@44   = ~You, <CHARNAME>, are a Child of Bh... him who Tiax disdains. It is Tiax’s glorious task to supervise your quest, to abort your destiny, to insure that the last trace of your foul parent eradicated!~
@45   = ~Great! You’re now my metaphysical nanny, is that it?~
@46   = ~I’ll have no one in my company who is opposed to me – especially not on such ridiculous grounds as those. Be off with you!~
@47   = ~Then I can save myself some trouble by killing you now, instead of later.~
@48   = ~Whew! It’s really been a great day so far. I can hardly wait for the rest of it.~
@49   = ~Pfeh! Your feeble metaphor betrays your lack of understanding. *That* is why you need *Tiax*! <CHARNAME>, you cannot avoid what must be. You are Tiax’s appointed tool whereby Tiax shall frustrate the crude, foolish designs of... of him. This is the glorious task for which the wondrous, the bountiful Cyric shall reward Tiax with the omnipotent and eternal Rule of ALL!!!~
@50   = ~Fool! Do you think a living god, the mighty Tiax can be diverted by words? <CHARNAME>, you cannot avoid what must be. You are Tiax’s appointed tool whereby Tiax shall frustrate the crude, foolish designs of... of him. This is the glorious task for which the wondrous, the bountiful Cyric shall reward Tiax with the omnipotent and eternal Rule of ALL!!!~
@51   = ~Er... no. No violence is necessary. Not for a very long time, anyway. Mighty Tiax shall explain. <CHARNAME>, you cannot avoid what must be. You are Tiax’s appointed tool whereby Tiax shall frustrate the crude, foolish designs of... of him. This is the glorious task for which the wondrous, the bountiful Cyric shall reward Tiax with the omnipotent and eternal Rule of ALL!!!~
@52   = ~Tiax has noted your claim to leadership of this group, <CHARNAME>, and has allowed it to continue, because it amuses him. The petty conceits of the enslaved delight both Cyric and his favored, but you lack proper enthusiasm in your duties. Tiax demands blood and death, pain and misery, that all might know Cyric's will and despair, yet you have shown insufficient enthusiasm in this regard! Mend your attitude, lest you find yourself shovelling manure when Tiax seizes control of all rather than carving hearts from the chests of Tiax's enemies!~
@53   = ~Tiax rules!~
@54   = ~Why would you want me to spread pain and misery? What's the purpose of such evil actions?~
@55   = ~So... exactly what do you want me to do? Dropkick a baby off a cliff?~
@56   = ~Carving the hearts from people's chests is for amateurs. The truly great ones are never discovered until it's too late... Do we understand each other now, gnome?~
@57   = ~Get away from me, you fool. Can't you see I have greater matters on my mind than a delusional midget's power trip?~
@58   = ~The purpose!? The PURPOSE!?! The PURPOSE is to spread the will of Cyric and do as Tiax orders you! What higher purpose could there possibly be!? Your lot is to do as Tiax orders, do it quickly, and do it with a smile! Accept it joyfully, or accept it under pain of death! That is your silly "purpose"! Tiax will give you five days to mend your attitude about your "purpose", or Tiax walks, and destiny goes with him!~
@59   = ~*sigh* Who could have thought a megalomaniacal Priest of Cyric would be so unpleasant?~
@60   = ~I've had enough of your bloodthirsty beliefs, gnome. Get out of my sight.~
@61   = ~I've had enough of your bloodthirsty beliefs, gnome. Defend yourself!~
@62   = ~That's a start! Maybe set a few Paladins on fire while you're at it, or hack apart some old ladies. Whatever it takes to prove your worth to Tiax! Cyric demands blood and cruelty! Supply it, or Tiax will no longer guide this group! Tiax will grant you some small time to mend your attitude. Tiax walks if Cyric has not been sated!~
@63   = ~Alright, alright. Whatever you say.~
@64   = ~Since I have no intention of doing anything you suggest, you might as well just go, Tiax.~
@65   = ~Ummmmmm... errrrr... of course Tiax understands! Tiax is all wise! Tiax is all knowing! Errrr...Tiax will let you keep leading, I guess. But no more goodie goodie or Tiax walks!~
@66   = ~NOTHING is more important than the will of Tiax! He will give you one warning, and one warning only: mend your goodie-goodie ways or Tiax will leave! Please Tiax, or Tiax will go and find more suitable sacrificial pawns!~
@67   = ~Tiax will not be shunned! You are forgiven for now, but dare not to misstep again, slave!~
@68   = ~What?! You galley-whipped short-knickers! Tiax the Grand shall ascend without your bumbling sneakery! The Great Tiax, betrayed on all sides by those seeking to undermine his coming rule, casts aside the refuse he once called his slaves! Mindless fools! Breathe deep and fill your ill-fated lungs with the salty airs of your sorry destiny!~
@69   = ~Every hour that passes, the moment of Tiax's ascension grows closer! It won't be long now, and all of Tiax's enemies shall tremble at the mention of his name! His enemies shall bathe in rivers of their own blood, and all the unfaithful shall scream for Tiax's forgiveness and find only his unending wrath! Let Cyric's might spread the darkness of Tiax's power to the four corners of this miserable planet which Tiax will one day claim as his own! All hail Tiax! Praised be his name!~
@70   = ~<CHARNAME>, we must have a discussion. This... Tiax... has been going on these obnoxious rants for some time now. He reeks of evil, proclaims devotion to the wicked god Cyric, and is quite obviously an agent of dark powers.~
@71   = ~Moreover, he is *annoying me to no end!* Though his madness limits the damage he can cause, I fail to see how such a wicked creature could further the cause of Helm. Why do you keep him here!?~
@72   = ~Move aside, smart guy! TIAX is coming through, and you haven't groveled sufficiently to be allowed to stand anywhere near him!~
@73   = ~Oh, I wouldn't DREAM of impeding your passage, my small-nosed foul-smelling 'friend.'~
@74   = ~Tiax's nose will not be mocked! Speak once more, and Tiax will introduce your head to a severe bludgeoning!~
@75   = ~From the way I've seen you fight, I would say I would be in more danger if you were to breathe on me than if you were to try and swing that child's toy in my direction. A diseased gibberling with no eyes and three limbs missing would have a better chance of landing an attack than you, Tiax!~
@76   = ~Tiax has had ENOUGH! SMART GUY DIES!~
@77   = ~Fiend! We will take no such action while I'm a member of this group. It is a wonder of my self-control that I haven't sliced you in half as of yet!~
@78   = ~Boo would never tolerate such actions! His very ears hurt from you speaking of them! Cause my hamster more pain, and I shall practice my gnome-tossing technique on YOU!~
@79   = ~I advise you to disregard this outburst, <CHARNAME>.~
@80   = ~Silence, *paladin*!~
@81   = ~When Tiax speaks, the RATS should keep silent!~
@82   = ~When Tiax rules the world he will collect the tongues of rangers. Yours will be the first one to be brought to Tiax by his slaves, Kivan.~
@83   = ~Stop staring at me, weaklings! Tiax's words were for our pretend-leader, not a whiny goodie-good like you! Now, what say you, <CHARNAME>? An eternity of reveling in the slaughter of Tiax's enemies, or goodie-good whining and an eternity of latrine duty at Tiax's whim? ~
@84   = ~Tiax has a proposal for you, paladin.~
@85   = ~I'm not interested in the proposals of madmen. Begone.~
@86   = ~BAH! You SHALL hear me out, or you shall suffer long on the rack when Tiax rules all! The path of the false god Helm is contrary to the teachings of Cyric. Your paladinhood is an affront to the Black Sun, and Cyric demands compensation for such a travesty!~
@87   = ~As such, Tiax offers you a choice: you may renounce your so-called "paladinhood", paying homage to the might of Cyric and his chosen servant Tiax, or you may suffer as few mortals have ever suffered when Tiax seizes control of all. The choice is yours!~
@88   = ~Foul Cyric-spawn! Even were your offer not simply a symptom of your madness, I would never sell my God, and my soul, to your wicked master! Your crazed ranting has no meaning to me, so be silent and slink away like the disgusting little cur you are.~
@89   = ~So be it! You refuse to renounce your goody-good ways of your own free will, so you will instead renounce them a thousand times upon the altar of Cyric just before I rip your goody-good heart from your chest! Beware the day when Tiax rules all in Cyric's name, for on that day you shall BEG for Tiax's mer...~
@90   = ~Just *be silent*, already! By Helm, but I grow tired of you. As I said, slink away from me and speak no more. I wish nothing to do with you.~
@91   = ~Great Tiax orders you to speak, worm!~
@92   = ~I keep him around because he's helpful to the group. Like you say, he can't cause much damage in his present mental state, so why worry?~
@93   = ~I keep him around because he amuses me. I get a kick out of his crazed rants.~
@94   = ~Haven't you been listening to a word the gnome says, Ajantis? He's destined to conquer all! Now, what rational person could understand that and *not* try to get in good with the future ruler of the world?~
@95   = ~I keep him for the same reason I keep you, Ajantis. I need pawns in order to achieve my goals, and you both do quite nicely.~
@96   = ~You know, you're absolutely right, Ajantis. Why *am* I keeping this obnoxious little gnome? Tiax! Go away! Shoo, shoo!~
@97   = ~I would rather not share my motives for keeping Tiax around, Ajantis. ~
@98   = ~Tiax, harmless!? BAH! We'll see whose harmless when TIAX smites you for your faithlessness... errr, that is, when he rules!~
@99   = ~You think Tiax is a clown, here for your amusement!? Would you like Tiax to do a little dance and wear a funny costume, as well!? Why Cyric granted Tiax such disrespectful slaves, Tiax will never know, but he tires of this impudence! World conquest shall come soon, and then his slave's laughter will turns to tears upon the sacrificial altar!~
@100  = ~Greater words of wisdom have never been spoken! You have earned a place in Tiax's guard of honor, when Tiax rules for your faith and obedience, and will have the honor of kissing Tiax's feet daily in homage to his glory! All praise the might of Tiax, for only the faithful shall survive his wrath!~
@101  = ~Tiax's slave DARES refer to him as mere pawn!? Tiax is KING, though he can still move in any space he likes and shall never be checkmated! Such impudence shall earn you the wrath of Cyric himself, if you are fortunate enough to survive Tiax's wrath when he rules!~
@102  = ~Tiax is pleased with his slave.~
@103  = ~Tiax ventures to greatness!~
@104  = ~Tiax is pleased with his slave. There is no need to share Tiax's plans of conquest with woolheaded paladins.~
@105  = ~It grates upon my conscience and my patience, but I will accept your judgment, <CHARNAME>. Know, however, that I'll have no objection when the day comes that you expel this gnome once and for all from our midst! Onward!~
@106  = ~I'm afraid, <CHARNAME>, we do not share the same sense of humor. I will be very happy when this gnome parts ways from our group. For now, however, I yield to your judgment.~
@107  = ~<CHARNAME>, you've either gone as mad as the crazed gnome, or you're having fun with me. I pray, for all our sakes, that it's the latter.~
@108  = ~Pawn, is it!? Obviously, I have made an error in judgment joining forces with you! Farewell, <CHARNAME>; when next we meet, if you have not amended your wicked behavior, it shall only be as foes!~
@109  = ~Praised be Helm! Perhaps now, my headache will fade away in peace and quiet. Thank you, <CHARNAME>, for your keen judgment.~
@110  = ~I shall bow to your leadership, <CHARNAME>, but I will not pretend to be happy about it. Should this "Tiax" ever convert his wicked thoughts into actions, then I shall be forced to slay him, and I give you fair warning of this now. Onward!~
@111  = ~The patience of Tiax nears the breaking point! Why must Cyric take so long in allowing Tiax to rule!? At this rate, Tiax will have barely conquered the Heartlands by the time he starts losing bladder control and eating soft foods!~
@112  = ~Silly Tiax! You need to stop and smell the flowers. Stop rushing things! World conquest can wait; we have a super fun adventure ahead of us, and it'll be far better than being trapped in a stuffy ol' throne room.~
@113  = ~Tiax has no time for such nonsense! Tiax would rather stomp on the flowers in order to demonstrate his power and dominance! When Tiax rules, he will order all fields of flowers to be torn from the ground, such that no one will be distracted from their abject worship of his majesty by their fragrance!~
@114  = ~What a terrible thought! Tiax, why can't you just be content with the things we have? World conquest doesn't mean much if it makes you a sourpuss in the process.~
@115  = ~Bah! Tiax has had enough of this. Thirty days in the stocks when Tiax rules for the annoying slave with the bubbly personality and irritating voice!~
@116  = ~Tiax commands that you stop staring at him, halfling!~
@117  = ~What? Oh, I was just thinking. Tiax, you and I should go on a heist sometime. I bet pullin' the sneak on some dandy ol' nobleman's house would be just the thing to lighten you up!~
@118  = ~Tiax has more important things to worry about than tawdry trinkets! His day approaches, and when it does, he shall simply TAKE whatever he pleases without petty sneaking or trickery!~
@119  = ~If the nobles don't respond quickly enough to his demands, he'll have their homes torched to the ground, their families sent to work the coal mines, and their heads mounted on the gates to his palace! Tiax's will be done!~
@120  = ~Ouch, Tiax, you're making my stomach queasy with that kind of talk. What I think you need is a big hug to make you feel better and get those nasty ol' thoughts out of your head!~
@121  = ~Bah! Tiax has no need for such sentimental idiocy! Away from me, ye obnoxious slave, before Tiax decides to... Gaaah! ACCHH! GET AWAY!~
@122  = ~Oh, come on, Tiax! It's just a hug! Now, don't you feel better?~
@123  = ~Tiax's personal space has been VIOLATED! Blast you! Away with you, and never touch Tiax again, unless he gives you permission!~
@124  = ~Ooops, I guess that didn't help much. Next time I'll have to give you a big kiss on the lips! That'll make you less of a sourpuss!~
@125  = ~Why must Tiax trudge through the middle of nowhere in order to seek his dominance? If there were any justice in the world, his servants would simply come to HIM and prostrate themselves at his feet, rather than Tiax being forced to wander mindlessly from place to place!~
@126  = ~Your kind always whines in the face of any hardship. A Cyricist with a backbone is a rare breed indeed; most would rather wallow away their meaningless existences in the lap of luxury, manipulating from the background, never experiencing the joy of battle or the invigorating feel of one's mace impacting against an enemy's skull. Cowards, all of them.~
@127  = ~Who would DARE to call Tiax coward!? Tiax fears NO ONE! His will dominates all, and Cyric's enemies shall be laid low before his wrath!~
@128  = ~I call you coward because you ARE a coward. Your wicked god is proof enough of that; you would rather plant a knife in an enemy's back, rather than face them in battle. Tempus teaches that such tactics are for muggers and traitors, not warriors born and bred for war!~
@129  = ~Bah! And that is why CYRIC shall dominate all, and Tempus shall be his humble, meaningless lackey! Cyric teaches that all methods to power are correct; the power alone is what matters, not the method!~
@130  = ~That is also why Cyric is lost to his lunacy while Tempus still wields his power with clarity and focus. Cyric's wicked ways backfired on him, costing him everything, while Tempus's honor remains unstained, his power unrivalled. You shall learn one day, far too late, that your god has made you weak while mine has made me strong. Now away with you.~
@131  = ~...and YOU! Your job shall be-~
@132  = ~I don't care. Be quiet.~
@133  = ~Impertinence! Tiax WAS going to elevate you to the status of a stool polisher, but thinks now that perhaps you would serve better as a expediter of excrement, you pa-~
@134  = ~Hear me now, for it is the only time I shall bother to grace you with my attention long enough to say it. I care not what little delusions bubble in that stewpot head of yours, fool. Be quiet.~
@135  = ~EXCREMENT is too good for you! You, you shall be a concubine for the mindflay-~

@145  = ~Don't get too cocky, pointy-ear! You may have the advantage now, but when Tiax rules, his harem shall number in the tens of thousands, with all the most beautiful women of every race gathered in it's number! Then Tiax shall lock you in his dungeon for the remainder of your years, never again knowing the embrace of a beautiful woman, so that you will curse the day you did not bend knee to Tiax when you had the chance!~
@146  = ~When you say "all the most beautiful women of every race", do you mean by your standards or theirs? A Dwarven woman and her beard might look stunning for the dwarf men of the stronghold she hails from, after all.~
@147  = ~There are no standards, save those set by Tiax! His wives and concubines shall have the most curvaceous forms, their skin shall be soft and blemishless, and their noses shall be of the most tremendous size, with the most bountiful tufts of nostril hair! None but perfect physical specimens may serve Tiax!~
@148  = ~Tremendous noses? Nostril hair? Ahhh, but I forget; Gnomes have their own unique standards, don't they?~
@149  = ~Prepare your daughter well for the future, elf. She will grow up in the new age of Tiax, and she may weep in shame when she learns her father was one of Tiax's detractors rather than one of his servile flunkies! That is, presuming I do not send her to the gallows with you. Tiax has not yet decided if the children of his enemies shall eventually die along with their parents!~
@150  = ~I AM preparing her well, Tiax. Not quite for the future you anticipate, but I assure you I will teach her all the skills she needs to survive in the world.~
@151  = ~Ahhh, like boot-licking and groveling to her inevitable masters?~
@152  = ~No, the ways to survive in the city and in the wilderness and keep away from slimy, indecent, lusty males... you know the type. Ahh, all the things I could teach her...~
@153  = ~BAH! Who needs fire when the warmth of Tiax's power shall one day sustain all? Should you teach her to bow and scrape at Tiax's feet, begging him to allow her to live that she might serve him for yet another day, you would be teaching her something useful!~
@154  = ~As it stands, Tiax is getting closer to deciding that his enemies and their children shall ALL die when Tiax ascends to his rightful rule! Namara's pretty little skull would make a fine adornment to Tiax's throne!~
@155  = ~Hmmm... Listen closely, Tiax. Coran will make a rattle from Tiax’s head, should he dare to threaten Namara again.~
@156  = ~Tiax would know more of the nation of Rashemen. Tiax has never been there, but is fascinated by the... errr... culture. Yes, the culture. You shall tell him of Rashemen, its defenses, its number of Witches, its terrain, and its fortifications... and perhaps in doing so you shall please Tiax!~
@157  = ~I have nothing to say of mine homeland to one such as thee, especially information of such an important nature.~
@158  = ~Tiax does not ask for information. Tiax DEMANDS information!~
@159  = ~Then Tiax shalt have to be disappointed. Thou wilt not pry a word from mine lips whilst I still breathe.~
@160  = ~Why must Tiax's servants constantly defy him!? Does Cyric taunt him with such uncooperative slaves!?!~
@161  = ~When Tiax rules, he shall FORCE the Rashemi witch to talk, and she shall gladly tell him whatever he pleases with a SMILE!~
@162  = ~Until then, however, the conquest of Rashemen and its wholesale worship of the mighty Tiax shall have to wait... but Tiax grows impatient, surrounded by traitors and fools as he is!~
@163  = ~Tiax thinks the Red Wizards would make perfect slaves to his glory. Someday, the remainder of your organization will bend knee to my majesty just as you have, my servant! What a glorious day that shall be! A thousand red-robed wizards, all paying homage to their liege, and praying that his wrath does not descend upon them! Tiax shall stand before them, and they shall TREMBLE at his slightest spoken word!~
@164  = ~(Again I am shaken from my thoughts by the ranting of mindless inferiors...) Can't you see I'm thinking, gnome!? If you wish to prattle on about whatever idiocy it is you've dreamed up now, then do so where I can no longer hear you, see you... or smell you, for that matter.~
@165  = ~...and when Tiax stands before that congregation of slave-mages dedicated to his service, he shall be sure, and tear your heart from your chest and feed it to wild dogs, that all might know the penalty of disobeying his command! If you will not serve obediently as a mage, then you shall serve as a grisly example of the fate of all unbelievers!~
@166  = ~(All it would take is a knife carefully drawn across the throat in his sleep, or a "poorly aimed" spell, and I could be rid of this ranting fool forever. So tempting... so tempting...)~
@167  = ~Thayvian! Mighty Tiax is gracing you with the privilege to give him counsel.~
@168  = ~(I'd rather be graced with stepping in fresh manure.) What is it? Out and be done with it, I am very busy.~
@169  = ~Tiax is planning to have a harem full of concubines, once he is the ruler of the world. I request the information on the way the Thayvians arrange things, so I might ponder on implementation and improvements. If I like your answer, I might even appoint you the chief eunuch.~
@170  = ~Do not allow the fact that I have not put a fireball up your horribly large nostrils give you a false sense of security! Address me with proper respect! (Pfah! The only chance he has of maintaining a harem is if I were at my usual best and seeing to the satisfaction and welfare of the ladies...)~
@171  = ~Silence! Tiax made you a great favor of asking your opinion, and you are babbling some nonsense. Speak on the subject, lest Tiax would cast you out from his grandiose plans!~
@172  = ~(There is no arguing with the insane, this I grant.) Let it not be said I am not a generous man, then. You need advice with women, and it is understandable. There are three key words to maintaining concubines, and those are charm, buy, then guard.~
@173  = ~However, as you clearly lack what is necessary for the first, and have no chance of achieving any wealth for the second, I see no reason why you should worry about the third.~
@174  = ~Mighty Tiax is pleased with your answer for now, yet he is displeased with your tone. Tiax in his generosity wants to elevate this slave to his inner circle; but Tiax has heard a hint of jealousy in the voice of his slave, and advises that the slave sire little bearded mages while he still can.~
@175  = ~(Have I been dismissed?) Listen, insufferable creature, it would take an army and three twenty foot fences to guard your harem, but not from outside intruders. I can see no man, woman, or woodland creature, no matter how low of birth, suffering your presence for more than a minute.~
@176  = ~When Tiax rules, Tiax thinks this would be a great place for a statue, honoring his greatness! Standing three hundred feet into the air, covered in precious jewels, and forged of gold and mithril! 'Tis DESTINED! Oh, and maybe the rest of you will deserve a plaque a little down the road mentioning your contribution to Tiax's rule. A small plaque.~
@177  = ~You'll be fortunate, if you receive the honor of an unmarked grave, when the inevitable half-blind kobold shoots you dead, my delusional friend. Your megalomania has grown quite stale and uninteresting at this point. Have you nothing ELSE to talk about?~
@178  = ~Errrr... well, would you care to hear Tiax's ideas about how best to slaughter the faithless and cow the masses to his whim?~
@179  = ~I thought not. Silence is golden, Tiax. I suggest you go over there and shut up.~
@180  = ~You! Tiax demands a song. Play a hymn to the might and glory of Tiax, and how Tiax's rule of all is inevitable, and make it catchy! Tiax has no patience for bad music.~
@181  = ~Errrr... I'm afraid I don't have any songs like that on hand, Tiax.~
@182  = ~Ye insolent slave! You have no songs dedicated to Tiax!? When Tiax rules, such incompetence will be punished with a sound flogging and the removal of the offending slave's tongue! When Tiax rules, there shall be no songs BUT those songs dedicated to Tiax, and all will sing of his glory across the land or face his wrath! So Tiax proclaims. His will be done!~
@183  = ~I could always play you another song. I know quite a number of them, and more than one would make your heart swell with such happiness that you would forget all about this fixation you have on world conquest.~
@184  = ~BAH! Tiax pays no notice! There is no music as sweet as slaves paying homage to Tiax's glory, and Tiax will not settle for anything less! Go now, and compose a song hailing the tremendous size of Tiax's nose, or describing the majesty with which he annihilates his enemies!~
@185  = ~If its alright by you, Tiax, I think I'll pass for now.~
@186  = ~Blasphemer! You'll have plenty of time to compose hymns to Tiax's power and glory, when you're rotting in his dungeon, begging for his forgiveness! Such is the will of Tiax!~
@187  = ~Tiax demands you show him respect! Tiax will not put up with this ridicule for much longer!~
@188  = ~Oh, quit bein' such a milch cow! I'm just havin' some fun, Tiax! You know we're friends!~
@189  = ~Friends!? Tiax has no friends, only slaves and lackeys and yes-men who bask in Tiax's glory, hoping that his wrath does not fall upon them! You risk Tiax's wrath by assuming that you are Tiax's equal!~
@190  = ~Oh, fine, be that way. I know that YOU consider ME a friend as well, though! Hasn't Cyric himself said so?~
@191  = ~What!?! Cyric has said no such thing, and Tiax is the only creature worthy of hearing the words of Cyric! How would YOU know what Cyric wishes!?~
@192  = ~Oh, Cyric talks to me, too, silly. That must mean that I'm destined to rule the world with you, and that therefore I'm your equal! Won't this be fun?~
@193  = ~Can it be you, my Queen? NO! YOU LIE! BLASPHEMY!!! Cyric speaks to Tiax, and only to Tiax!!!~
@194  = ~What's that you say, Cyric? You say that Tiax is no longer your favored, and so I should rule the world alone? Why, thank you!~
@195  = ~Tiax will not listen to this drivel! Cyric speaks only to Tiax! CYRIC speaks only to TIAX!!! Cyric would not bestow such a blessing upon this whelp! No, Tiax will listen to no more!!!~
@196  = ~Mine! Looks like some gnomes just can't take a joke...~
@197  = ~Tiax DEMANDS that you show him the respect he is due!~
@198  = ~Only fools demand respect. The wise earn it, and I have yet to see anything from you but lunacy and deranged ranting.~
@199  = ~You dare!? TIAX is ALL-wise, for nothing DARES escape his knowledge!~
@200  = ~Tiax has already solved this entire 'quest'; he knows precisely where <CHARNAME>'s enemies lurk and plot and plan, but he does not share this knowledge, for were Tiax's mind to be unveiled to lesser creatures they might WILT under the onslaught of his sheer brilliance!~
@201  = ~Oh? Might you at least impart the name of the armored fiend who slew Gorion to us lowly mortals, oh wise Tiax? Surely we would not wilt before that bit of knowledge!~
@202  = ~Errrmm... Tiax knows, but shall NOT share such information! It... errrr... isn't that much knowledge, but the POWER behind it is truly staggering! Were Tiax to speak the name, before it was properly revealed to his pawns, they might crumble to DUST from its prophetic wisdom!~
@203  = ~As I thought. By Silvanus, but I'll be glad when <CHARNAME> gets rid of this ridiculous gnome...~
@204  = ~HA! Tiax KNEW you would say that!~
@205  = ~Kneel, worm, and obey your lord and master! Tiax demands that you show your respect for his might, right now!~
@206  = ~Ya twit! Get in my way again, and I'll break yer knee caps. Won't have much luck rulin' the world if ye can't walk, now, will ya?~
@207  = ~Should Tiax no longer be able to walk, then he shall have slaves carry him from place to place! In fact, when Tiax rules, he won't NEED kneecaps anymore! Not, of course, that such a petty slave as yourself could ever hope to harm one so great and powerful as the mighty Tiax!~
@208  = ~One day, I'll have ta teach ya a lesson or two in respect for your betters. Uppity gnomes should learn their place; diggin' up diamonds and jewels so we dwarves can get filthy, stinking rich off 'em.~
@209  = ~Tiax has transcended such petty things as gold and jewels; when he rules, these things shall line his throne room, but only as the merest of baubles to impress his foolish slaves into mindless obedience to his will!~
@210  = ~Ha! I've heard o' idiots sayin' they transcend gold and jewels; usually, it means I have to give 'em the once over with a club to get my pay from 'em!~
@211  = ~Ye may be crazy 'cause of yer world conquest fixation, but yer stupid 'cause ye don't understand that gold is what makes yer coveted world go 'round. Now off with ye.~
@212  = ~When Tiax rules, those of you who have proved your faithfulness will be spared his wrath. All those who travel with Tiax now may find that one day they have earned a place as one of his throne-bearers, or as cleaner of his chamber pots, if they have sufficiently pleased him!~
@213  = ~Not this tripe again! Spare us yer constant ramblings, ya fool; the rest of us have more important things to think about.~
@214  = ~More important than Tiax!? BLASPHEMY! Tiax is the center of all things, the focus of your otherwise meaningless, misbegotten life!~
@215  = ~Without Tiax, you are naught but an ant to be crushed by his enormous boot! Tiax demands immediate bowing and scraping in order for the ugly dwarf to receive his forgiveness! Do so, and perhaps Tiax will limit your flogging to a mere fifteen strokes!~
@216  = ~This dwarf bows to no one, unless there be a sufficient amount of gold in the offer. Speak again, when ye have enough gold to fill my coffers to the bursting, and I might show you some respect!~
@217  = ~Tiax will one day have all the gold in the world, and yet the ugly dwarf is so stupid that he fails to prepare for that day by showing homage to his master!~
@218  = ~Those who obey Tiax's will shall find themselves favored above all, but obviously YOU won't be included in that group. Begone, and prepare for the day when Tiax's punishment shall be upon you!~
@219  = ~OW! What mosquito would DARE sting Tiax!?! This forest shall burn for its lack of hospitality when Tiax rules, its animal and insect population shall be put to the sword for its failure to prevent this outrage, and its soil shall be sown with salt so that nothing may ever grow here again!!! So Tiax demands, and so shall it be done!~
@220  = ~C-come now, Tiax, it's just a m-mosquito bite. It happens to us all. You need not take it so p-personally.~
@221  = ~Not take it personally?! One of Tiax's faithless slaves has caused PAIN to him! Such an action is an insult to all living things on this planet, and when Tiax rules it shall be a crime punishable by eternal torment! Let all things quail in terror when Tiax is stung, for he shall lay waste to their lands and see his traitorous servants butchered for miles around for the insult!~
@222  = ~The only p-person your anger will harm is yourself. If you keep s-screaming like this, you'll bring on ap-apoplexy.~
@223  = ~Tiax will scream when Tiax FEELS like screaming! Tiax demands that his slaves obey his will, and yet again and again they refuse to bend knee to his glory! TIAX WILL HAVE HIS REV...~
@224  = ~errrk...~
@225  = ~owww... the world... is spinning...~
@226  = ~*gasping for breath* OK. Maybe Tiax will stop screaming for a while.~
@227  = ~Tiax thinks you will make a good galley slave, half-elf. A lash on the back and your kind rushes to the job with such enthusiasm!~
@228  = ~What k-kind?~
@229  = ~Why, spineless blubbering cowards, of course! Tiax needs slaves who obey orders promptly and without talking back! So few exist at the moment, but soon the whole world shall be as pathetic and obedient as you, and then Tiax shall be pleased!~
@230  = ~S-so kind of you to l-let me know your opinion.~
@231  = ~Speak to my husband in such a way again, gnome, and I will tear your wagging tongue from your mouth.~
@232  = ~P-please, Jaheira, I can defend m-myself.~
@233  = ~I d-do not understand why <CHARNAME> has brought you along, but I need not t-tolerate this sort of rudeness! P-please, leave me alone.~
@234  = ~Pssstt... Elf! ELF!~
@235  = ~What is it, Tiax?~
@236  = ~Tiax has an... offer for you. Despite your somewhat tiresome nature, you could prove useful, IF you were properly motivated!~
@237  = ~Whatever it is, Tiax, I assure you I am not interested. I will not be dragged down into the schemes of a disciple of Cyric.~
@238  = ~Ahhhh, but Tiax KNOWS what you most desire! Tiax has heard you whispering the name, swearing your eternal vengeance against those who stole her from you.~
@239  = ~TIAX, in his infinite power and wisdom, is willing to grant you both her return and vengeance against those who cut her down, but in return Tiax DEMANDS...~
@240  = ~Stay your demands. I do not require anything from you, madman. I am an arrow on the bow of Shevarash, and it is his hand that aims and guides me.~
@241  = ~Tiax demands that his slave cease babbling to that rodent! Tiax is getting a headache from such idiocy!~
@242  = ~Boo is no mere rodent, silly gnome. He is my friend, and the only Miniature Giant Space Hamster left in the realms besides! Where Boo goes, Minsc will follow, and bring the righteous fist of justice with him!~
@243  = ~Bah! What nonsense! Tiax is all-wise and all-knowing, and yet he has never heard of any "Miniature Giant Space Hamster"!~
@244  = ~It's true! Boo possesses power the likes of which you and I can never understand, even if we try really really hard. His power, however, is only used to guide Minsc's boot to the butt of evil!~
@245  = ~Tiax believes you've been driven stark raving mad by the proximity of Tiax's greatness next to your own inferiority! Tiax can't believe the indignity of being forced to travel with a band of simpering fools! Errrr... what kind of powers would he have, if he were really a Miniature Giant Space Hamster?~
@246  = ~It is as Minsc says. Such powers are unfeth- unfathomable by such as we!~
@247  = ~Unfathomable powers... unfathomable powers... hmmm... Tiax demands he be allowed to hold your hamster for a moment!~
@248  = ~Minsc knows evil ideas when he sees them forming! Only Minsc may speak with Boo! Boo only speaks to Minsc! And you MAY NOT hold him!~
@249  = ~Pssst... hamster! Tiax needs to speak to you, and best you listen to your future master well!~
@250  = ~*Boo squeaks.*~
@251  = ~The time of Tiax's ascension grows nigh. His enemies shall soon fear his wrath, and Tiax shall hunt them down like the rodents they are!.. Errrr, no offense.~
@252  = ~In any case, Tiax would offer you a place at his side. Tiax's victory is inevitable, and traveling with a brain-dead Ranger is no path to success for such a powerful entity. One day, you shall have all the seeds and grubs you can eat, if only you forsake this bald-headed twit for Tiax's glory!~
@253  = ~Wh... what? What is... BOO! Stay away from my hamster, gnome!~
@254  = ~Blast! Tiax's slave has interrupted important negotiations, beyond his meager capacity to understand! Turn around and close your ears, so that your betters might continue their discussion!~
@255  = ~No! BOO speaks only to MINSC, and MINSC speaks only to BOO! Or maybe not so much the last part. Still, Boo obviously must be kept away from you, for Boo cannot stand the whispering of such evil thoughts. Come, Boo, I shall keep you safe.~
@256  = ~Blast you! Tiax will have his revenge!~
@257  = ~Now is your chance, hamster! Rise up against the barbarian and join me! He is weakened from our battles, and will be easy prey!~
@258  = ~ARRRGGGH! Minsc knows evil when he hears it! You are trying to tempt Boo to turn against me, but we are friends eternal! Right, Boo?~
@259  = ~Errrr... right Boo?~
@260  = ~HA! Your hamster is mulling over my proposal! It's only a matter of time before he realizes that TIAX is the only choice for one so powe...~
@261  = ~AAHHHHH!!! OW! OW! OW! GET IT OFF ME! OWW!~
@262  = ~Yes! Go, Boo, go! Bite the evil little gnome! That will teach YOU to try and separate Minsc and Boo! Justice has been served!~
@263  = ~Tiax has a proposition for you, halfling. ~
@264  = ~Prop away then, oh mighty wi' words. Ain't had no laughs this tenday.~
@265  = ~Silence! TIAX has not given you permission to speak yet!~
@266  = ~Tiax has noted your skill with a blade, and your abilities with sneakery and murder. You have succeeded in pleasing Tiax with your actions, and Tiax would like to offer you employment as head of his secret police when he rules.~
@267  = ~You will scour the cities for Tiax's enemies, purging the disloyal and unbelievers, dismembering those who look the wrong way at the many statues of Tiax that will be spread across the land! What say you?~
@268  = ~Hmph. I says, do yer part first 'n' I'll be the finest becker and caller ye can find. 'Til, then, though, ye'd do better mindin' yer manners wi' me - less ye *wants* me to quit ye of yer mortal blood over a sennight or so.~
@269  = ~Ahhhh, Tiax delights to see the bloodlust of his servants! Tiax knows you will come around to seeing the wisdom of his plan. Until then, feign your independence and hope that Tiax does not change his mind! His will be done!~
@270  = ~Why must Tiax put up with the odor of this city!? When Tiax rules, an army of servants shall sweep his path clean as he advances, removing anything which might offend Tiax's nose! The streets shall sparkle and shine where Tiax travels, for those cities which fail to please Tiax shall be put to the torch and their inhabitants herded off for slave labor! So proclaims Cyric!~
@271  = ~What good is a city without a bit of dirt and grime? Personally, I like a little bit of degeneracy. It makes me... excited.~
@272  = ~Bah! Tiax has had enough dirt to last him a lifetime without having to deal with the smell of stale urine and unwashed peasants.~
@273  = ~It has been my experience, Tiax, that a place, which is overly infatuated with cleanliness, tends to be a place, which will bore me to tears. All the most entertaining diversions can be found in places, which aren't afraid of a little squalor and dirt.~
@274  = ~Just as a handsome mercenary in his dust-caked leather uniform can be a thousand times more entertaining than a paladin in his gleaming, well-polished plate armor, so can a dirty city with the appropriate gambling dens and taverns make the noble quarters of Waterdeep and Neverwinter pale in comparison.~
@275  = ~Bah! Tiax has no time for gambling or wenching while his destiny awaits him! Tiax will allow you all the grit and grime you please; Tiax will keep to his magnificent palace extending into the heavens! Cyric be praised that his time is fast approaching, and Tiax will never smell a sewer again!~
@276  = ~Even with his infinite wisdom, Tiax does not understand you, human.~
@277  = ~Then 'Tiax' should stop thinking about it and silence himself. Males should learn to be seen and not heard.~
@278  = ~Tiax will speak to whoever he pleases, whenever he pleases, about whatever he pleases! Your belief system is wholly flawed and ridiculous! Tiax has pondered and pondered, and can still not understand how you can view females as superior to males!~
@279  = ~Cyric forged Tiax himself, champion of his great hosts and ruler of all things, as a male. Clearly, this proves that males are superior to females, for were females superior to males then Tiax would be one.~
@280  = ~If anything, you help to prove just how realistic my belief system is.~
@281  = ~Even among males, you distinguish yourself by your stupidity and weakness. Your pragmatism is admirable, but otherwise you are beneath my notice. Now begone, and bother me no longer with your lunacy!~
@282  = ~Bah! When Tiax rules, he thinks he will add you to his harem just to teach you the respect due to you! We'll see what words you speak to Tiax THEN, oh ye faithless too-tall!~
@283  = ~Tiax does not feel well at all. Cleric! CLERIC!~
@284  = ~Waela yingil! Foolish gnome! You possess abilities to tend your own wounds. I'll not come rushing at your every beck and call as though I am your servant.~
@285  = ~But you *are* Tiax's servant! All exist for nothing but to serve Tiax!~
@286  = ~Pfeh. Continue to bleed, iblith. I'll not be healing you any time soon.~
@287  = ~Some day Tiax will rule... and then your impudence will be dealt with! ~
@288  = ~Ahhhh, hair as white as the snow and soul as black as coal! The nose could have been larger, but... Cyric, and by connotation Tiax himself, would benefit from servants such as yourself! Why have you dedicated yourself to the false god Shar,when the Black Sun would welcome you into his service?~
@289  = ~I serve Shar, yingil, and Shar alone. Do not tempt her wrath or mine with your feeble attempts at conversation.~
@290  = ~Shar is but Cyric's destined slave! No other so-called 'God' may stand against the might of Cyric, and yet you do not embrace his power, his majesty!?~
@291  = ~Fool! Your fledgling Cyric is naught before the Dark Goddess. And what might Cyric offer that Shar cannot grant me? She has shown me to the embrace of the darkness, and grants me the sweet dreams of nonexistence. What could Cyric possibly offer to tempt me away from my goddess?~
@292  = ~Why, a lifetime of enslavement at Tiax's hands, of course!~
@293  = ~Not only that, but you would be allowed to sing the praises of Cyric's name, sacrifice the faithless to his glory, and eventually meet your end, fighting against his enemies! What greater reward could be asked for then to live and die in the name of Cyric and his greatest champion!?~
@294  = ~You truly believe I would betray my goddess for eternal enslavement at the hands of a deranged yingil? Do not attempt to pass on your weak male god to me again, og'elend, or Shar may demand action from me that would not be to your benefit...~
@295  = ~Tiax enjoys your obsession with doom and hopelessness, elf. He believes that, alone among his slaves, you recognize the great doom which is approaching this world, for soon Tiax shall rise above all and claim it as his own! When Tiax rules, you will be his official doomsayer, spreading the word of the approach of Tiax's armies and bemoaning the destruction which he will bring!~
@296  = ~I don't believe you understand me at all, Tiax. Everything we do is hopeless, including your quest for world dominance. Your dreams of empire will turn to ashes, when our enemies crush us like the insects we are. ~
@297  = ~You dare deny Tiax's inevitable victory over all!? Your faithlessness will earn you nothing but sorrow when Tiax rules! Cyric himself has proclaimed Tiax's victory, and none may contest his will!~
@298  = ~Your Cyric is wallowing in madness at the moment, so I hardly think his word counts for much.~
@299  = ~BAH! Such impudence! Tiax believes he may have rated you too highly, slave. Fine, then! You will still proceed with his armies, but you will do so as a rotting carcass slung from Tiax's standard, such that all might see it and know the price of disobedience! So Tiax demands, and so it shall be done!~
@300  = ~Why do we waste our time in this miserable hole? Tiax has greater issues to attend to! Like conquering the world, for instance!~
@301  = ~You'll have no greater issues soon. This place will be the tomb of all of us. We quite obviously have no chance against the enemies who lurk in this place.~
@302  = ~Bah! Tiax isn't afraid of this place, or anything in it! He simply wishes for us to leave so that we can pursue other, more important matters!~
@303  = ~Oh, why do you insist on obsessing over your hopeless fantasy, Tiax? You're unlikely to survive the night, much less conquer the world!~
@304  = ~Our fate has been sealed for some time now, and before long, we'll all be nothing but rotting meat in the middle of this forgotten pit.~
@305  = ~Such foolishness! Tiax demands that his slave ceases whining! Your cowardice is shaking the morale of the rest of his cannon fodder, and Tiax will not tolerate letting his expendable pawns run from his service for their miserable lives.~
@306  = ~Very well, then, let us press onward and end this little 'expedition', but when Tiax is done, he will demand immediate action be taken towards his dominance of all!~
@307  = ~Tiax demands you stop glaring at him!~
@308  = ~Oh! I'm sorry, poor Tiax. I was just thinking what a strong resemblance you bear to an old friend of mine.~
@309  = ~Errrrr... friend?~
@310  = ~Didn't I just say that? Stop repeating everything I say, damn you! Now, where was I?~
@311  = ~Ahhh, yes, my friend! He was short, as you are, and a bit plump. For fun, we used to put him on a stick over a fire, and then turn him 'round and 'round and 'round until he was dizzy. Then, we would take him off, and we would devour him piece by piece, his screams filling the air and overwhelming us with joy and mirth. We had such fun!~
@312  = ~Ye talking ‘bout the woodchuck we had last night?~
@313  = ~Oh yes! You know him, then?~
@314  = ~Tiax is NOT FOOD! Try to eat Tiax, and you will suffer most greatly when he conquers all! Already you have denied yourself the future position of Tiax's royal cook with your crazed fantasies!~
@315  = ~Eat you?!? What a revolting idea! I was merely suggesting that we cook you a bit... and we *would* taste you, of course. Ah, well. Maybe another time. Your conversation doesn't amuse like his does anyway...~
@316  = ~Clangeddin!? Bah! What foolishness! Cyric is the one true god, and 'Clangeddin' had best step aside, when he comes through to hurl Tiax to his rightful position as ruler of all!~
@317  = ~I hardly think yer mad god's about ta take over the world anytime soon. Isn't he a stark ravin' lunatic?~
@318  = ~Cyric, insane!? HA! Cyric is no more insane than Tiax himself, future ruler of everything! Others only dismiss their true lord as insane for the paralyzing FEAR which his inevitable rule of all invokes in them! When Cyric rules all with Tiax by his side, their cowardly ranks shall be cleansed with fire and fury most terrible, and *then* we shall see who the true lunatics are!~
@319  = ~I've no fear o' yer treacherous god. Let his slaves come; they'll find 'emselves cut down by dwarven steel in the name o' Clangeddin, by day's end! An' with crazed priests like *you*, methinks the task won't be a difficult one.~
@320  = ~Tiax is SURROUNDED by traitors! Why do his slaves dare to defy his will when he offers them such a rare gift as continued existence for their mindless servitude!?~
@321  = ~Tiax will have you flogged and fed to wild boars when he rules over all, but until then, pray that you do not offend him again, 'lest he make your punishment all the more terrible!~
@322  = ~Tiax commands that you leave his presence! Your attitude grows tiring, and Tiax has no desire to nursemaid disobedient slaves!~
@323  = ~Ha! Like anyone cares fer what ye think, Tiax. Last I checked, <CHARNAME> here has th' final word on who stays an' who goes... an' believe you me, I'm nay more happy 'bout yer bein' here than ye are about me...~
@324  = ~Do you understand nothing, slave!? Tiax's word is LAW. You will leave his presence and pray that his wrath does not descend upon you, when this world falls under Tiax's inevitable domination! Tiax will brook no contradiction to his almighty will!~
@325  = ~Away, 'lest Tiax be forced to smite you! ~
@326  = ~So yer tellin' me you'd like ta get into a bit o' the ol' rough and tumble wi' me, then? How'd you like ta *make* me go 'way, Tiax? I never have an objection ta bustin' the skull o' a Cyric-lover.~
@327  = ~In fact, come ta think o' it, most o' those Iron Throne guards in the mine were Cyric-lovers, too, so it'd be me very own pleasure ta make you shriek like a pansy elf, if ye're up ta it!~
@328  = ~The slave *threatens* Tiax!?! BAH! Such foolishness! Tiax could break you in two using only his pinky, but, fortunately for you, his pinky is feeling tired today! Slink away, oh ye fool, and pray that Tiax's pinky doesn't get to feeling better anytime soon!~
@329  = ~I knew it. All talk, no fightin'. If ye're ever in the market fer a sound beatin', speak ta me again, Tiax. As fer now, until <CHARNAME> says else, I'm not about ta leave anytime soon, so get used ta me!~
