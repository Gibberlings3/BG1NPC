@0    = ~Jaheira, I will fold my blanket however I want to fold it, thank you very much.~
@1    = ~Ajantis, the Shadow Druids can use a person of your devotion and skills!~
@2    = ~My devotion lies with the Great Watcher. My heart and honor would not allow me to abandon his service.~
@3    = ~The Great Watcher concerns himself with justice, right? Justice for all.~
@4    = ~Of course, justice and protection.~
@5    = ~Can a knight of Helm stand idle when Nature itself is raped and molested?~
@6    = ~The lives of men are the foremost value of my Order. For cities to thrive there must be commerce; if cities thrive, they must grow, therefore houses must be built. I do not think this is an affront to nature, but rather nature's gift to man.~
@7    = ~Imagine a generous man, who opened his doors for a tired traveler and offered him shelter. As per the old custom he said to him: "My house is your house, traveler." The traveler ate at his table and slept in his house.~
@8    = ~Aye, a wise custom it is, my lady. Many a paladin has profited on his mission from hospitality of noble strangers.~
@9    = ~The next day that traveler returned and robbed the house of all its valuables, soiled the floors with the blood of the hosts' family and servants and burned the host's children...~
@10   = ~The host asked the traveler why he did all those things to him... and the traveler answered: "I only take what is mine."~
@11   = ~Such villainy! The man should be punished indeed!~
@12   = ~That's what the Shadow Druids do, Ajantis – punish those who are not satisfied with the gifts, but instead want to plunder the giver.~
@13   = ~I fancy to hear more about paladins, Ajantis.~
@14   = ~I am glad to oblige, ahem... m'lady. Why, I think that the device one of the noble brothers of my Order carries on his shield can describe perfectly a paladin to you. Just listen to it, Faldorn: "Unyielding, Untainted, Unstoppable."~
@15   = ~"Uncouth, Unwashed, Unshaven" would be more appropriate, in my opinion, but then again, you are the only paladin I know.~
@16   = ~"Uncouth, Unwashed, Unshaven" would be more appropriate, in my opinion, but then again, <CHARNAME> and you are the only paladins I know.~
@17   = ~You are too harsh, Faldorn! Indeed, a foul word might escape my lips in the heat of battle, but that is only to infuriate myself against the evil we face.~
@18   = ~Let the beast ROAR! Grrr!~
@19   = ~Something... something like that, yes.~
@20   = ~And... ahem... m'lady, as for your other comment, I truly apologize. Keldorn, my mentor, praised the fieldwork as an unsurpassed way to gain experience, but I find that there are some downsides to it... I yearn myself to wash and shave to be a more pleasing companion.~
@21   = ~But why? It's always attractive when a man returns to his natural state.~
@22   = ~Alora, with your small frame and general feebleness, I cannot imagine how you withstood life in Baldur's Gate.~
@23   = ~Oh, I like living in the city! Like, you wake up in the morning, go to the market, pick a purse or two, then get ice cream! Or maybe cream pie! Or cotton candy! You can't get cotton candy in the forest, I'll tell you!~
@24   = ~A wicked day it was, when a man decided that the pure taste of nature's fruits has to be obscured by his own creations.~
@25   = ~Huh, I like nuts and berries just as well. Like, cranberries and raspberries... The world is such a sweet place!~
@26   = ~The world was sweet, Alora. It's full of corruption, due to the perversions and excesses of civilization. Tarts and cakes, for example.~
@27   = ~Don't be so sour, Faldorn. Tarts and cakes are no evil. Oh, I think I see the problem now! You need something sweet, that's it! Here, have a try! I have some sugar-frosted strawberries in my backpack.~
@28   = ~Hmmm... sugar is natural, after all. Alright. I'll have some...~
@29   = ~*giggles* Now, that's much better! Evil tarts, heh.~
@30   = ~I cherish the lifestyle of our people. We live in harmony with nature, hunt for food and migrate with the herds of wild animals.~
@31   = ~'Tis the way of the Uthgardt barbarians, alright. But you are not one of us, Faldorn.~
@32   = ~I am born of the Black Ravens!~
@33   = ~Born - yes, but you were not raised by the tribe, in our tradition. You are not a valorous male warrior, nor are you a woman who'd make a good wife for a warrior.~
@34   = ~Still, I am of the Black Ravens. Maybe I can fight the battle with civilization by reuniting with my people and converting them to the cause of Silvanus and the Shadow Druids.~
@35   = ~When barbarians raid cities, they do not cry to the Oak Father, like you. They call to Tempus and Auril, and to their forefathers. They will not have you back, druid and servant of Silvanus.~
@36   = ~No more than the Seawolf will have me, until I'm the priestess of Tempus and a fighter in my own right.~
@37   = ~I do not believe you! GRRRR! You are lying!~
@38   = ~My nostrils still tremble after the last battle. *howls in excitement* Oak Father, what a fight!~
@39   = ~Our foes were worthy, and Tempus gave us victory! You might be a weirdling and a beastling, but you have Black Raven's blood in you! Have a drink of proper mead, Faldorn!~
@40   = ~*Faldorn snatches the drinking horn from Branwen and gulps all of the contents.* Nature was avenged! Glory to Silvanus!~
@41   = ~Tempus, the Lord of All Battles, gives strength to the arms of our warriors, and spirit to our magelings and such. What did our fight have to do with Silvanus?~
@42   = ~Ha! The Oak Father has enemies everywhere. Surely we have slain one or two among the bunch!~
@43   = ~Let's drink to that then! Glory to the victorious! Woe to the defeated!~
@44   = ~Being turned to stone – how strange and wonderful that must be! To go from being a moving part of nature to the immobile, but one around which all motion happens.~
@45   = ~Wonderful? 'Tis like dying slowly and endlessly! 'Tis worse than undeath!~
@46   = ~Grrr! How can you compare! Undeath is an abomination of corrupted weaklings, who try to cheat the Great Mother and to shift the balance.~
@47   = ~When you turned to stone, you were part of Great Mother herself. How can you find that repulsive, Branwen?~
@48   = ~Why don't you go and look into a basilisk's orbs, Faldorn? Mayhap you will succeed where I have failed.~
@49   = ~Coran, I have never seen you make a distinction between fair women and plain women in your courting. Yet you keep pretending to be an authority on beauty.~
@50   = ~Every woman is beautiful, of course. One learns with time to see a particular smile, a shape of the earlobe, the wave of hair above the forehead – and enjoy the privilege of seeing it. It is a rare thing, however, when the whole of the woman is perfectly beautiful.~
@51   = ~All things of nature are perfect. But civilization spoils it... I would be surprised if you could find an unblighted beautiful woman in a city!~
@52   = ~The answer is simple. Yes, I have seen such a woman.~
@53   = ~Ellesime, the elven Queen of Suldanessellar. There is no woman fairer than Her Grace. Her hair shines like gold, her face is fair as moonlight, her gown is the color of peacock feathers...~
@54   = ~Coran, you are drooling.~
@55   = ~I was thinking that the goat's ears will fit better on you than the mule-shaped ones.~
@56   = ~Lovely choice. I think I do prefer goats to mules. Tell me, Faldorn, is this because I criticized your appearance the other day?~
@57   = ~I was thinking of affinity, not appearances.~
@58   = ~Faldorn, I am of the opinion that humor should be wielded as a rapier, in a series of elaborate feints and parries. You smash with yours as though it's a club.~
@59   = ~What better weapon for a druid than a club?~
@60   = ~Ah, I am afraid you place too much emphasis on your calling. One day you might want to have something different in your life.~
@61   = ~Sometimes I just hate you all! We do so little to protect the Great Mother and convert the unbelievers!~
@62   = ~Faldorn, I doubt the Shadow Druids can return many people back to nature. I remember my own experience with converting one lovely city-dweller. She was particularly interested in the lifestyle of the wild elves.~
@63   = ~And what the lady wants, the lady gets, right, Coran?~
@64   = ~Right. I took her to the Forest of Tethyr, hoping to... to show her the ways of the wild elves. We first arrived in the majestic boughs of the Blackbird's Glade.~
@65   = ~And?~
@66   = ~The moment we stepped under the forest's canopy, she thought we were lost.~
@67   = ~*snorts*~
@68   = ~I took her to the meadows, where wild grasses and flowers tickled our knees gently, filling the air with the sweetest smell.~
@69   = ~Even townlings usually like that...~
@70   = ~All she would talk about was how the pollen was dirtying her white skirt. Then she refused to sit down on the grass, since she thought it was dusty.~
@71   = ~As the sun was lowering, coloring the world in all shades of gold and crimson, I listened to her opinion on mosquitoes. ~
@72   = ~Mosquitoes will never touch you if you rub some juice from guril berries on yourself.~
@73   = ~I did, but you know how it leaves purple spots on skin and clothes? She was so upset that I suggested she eat one instead...~
@74   = ~But that would not help against mosquitoes, silly elf! Only townlings eat guril berries when they are too shy to hear nature's call for them to mate!~
@75   = ~Hmmm... Coran, I can't see *you* being displeased by the result...~
@76   = ~Ah, that was no good either. In the morning I woke up to her complaining that I had ripped her shift made of some sort of Kozakuran silk.~
@77   = ~The last time I saw her, she said that I still owed her 600 golden pieces for the damnable garment. If you ask me the cut was only improved, but those civilized ladies...~
@78   = ~Grrr! Stupid weaklings!~
@79   = ~Dynaheir, do you know much of prophecies and such things?~
@80   = ~I am knowledgeable in such lore that concerns Rashemen, Faldorn.~
@81   = ~Well, it has to do, since that's more than anybody else seems to know. I was brought to the druids' grove on the day a very famous druid, Kador of Cormyr, made his last known appearance. Some say it was a day of his death, as well. I have been thinking...~
@82   = ~Thou thinkest thyself a vessel for his spirit?~
@83   = ~Yes, Dynaheir, that's what I thought. Is it possible?~
@84   = ~Thou wilt be wiser to stop worrying about signs, and live by his teaching. Then thou wilt be his spiritual heir indeed.~
@85   = ~You speak wisely, Dynaheir, yet I wish to know if his magical scimitar – the Emerald Ray – is mine by rights.~
@86   = ~Magical weapons oft seek out its wielders. Should the blade be destined for thee, it wilst be thine.~
@87   = ~I like fire magic. It has the fury of elements, and the power of it is so visible.~
@88   = ~Though I cannot deny the use of fire, I must count its overly destructive power among my least favorite types of magic. That is why a caster should exercise particular care when using such a spell. Damage done canst exceed the benefits.~
@89   = ~Elements cannot be overly destructive. Once you release it, you have no control over it. It is in nature's hands, Dynaheir.~
@90   = ~But, Faldorn, the purpose of the magical arts is to tame the destructive powers of the elements, and make them yield what is useful to men.~
@91   = ~Your understanding of the purpose of magic is corrupted, Dynaheir. As in anything else the purpose is to be one with nature, to befriend it, not to turn it into a slave or a tool.~
@92   = ~Taming doth not mean enslavement, young druid. Perhaps, with the wisdom time brings, thou shalt come to see it as well.~
@93   = ~I know slavery when I see it, Dynaheir, whatever name you call it.~
@94   = ~Rashemen is a land where wilderness is respected.~
@95   = ~Indeed, we love and respect our land. Rashemi's character itself is said to be shaped in its likeness. Untamed, severe and unyielding.~
@96   = ~Every land affects and changes the creatures which populate it.~
@97   = ~That might be, Faldorn. But do we not all feel that the place of our birth is special somehow?~
@98   = ~I would not know, Dynaheir. I am of Uthgardt stock and come from the Black Raven tribe, but I was raised by Shadow Druids.~
@99   = ~'Tis sad when one is raised away from her people.~
@100  = ~I do not rue my destiny. I was fated to serve nature.~
@101  = ~Black raven! *Faldorn stretches her hands towards the bird.* Father, bestow wisdom on your daughter and give strength to her wings!~
@102  = ~What are you calling to the useless birds for? Is there not enough dirt around? (Maybe that's why Elminster has that hat. I wouldn't put it past him.)~
@103  = ~Silence, civilized lout! If I lose a blessing from my Spirit Father because of your mindless babbling, next time I will feed him your heart!~
@104  = ~Spirit Father? Why do I have to suffer ignorant barbarians around me? Uneducated, lumbering, blind fools everywhere! What are you muttering about now, witch? Some sacred ladybug, no doubt?~
@105  = ~You will dream of a black raven tonight, arrogant southerner. It will peck the eyes out from the skull of a fool in a red robe. An uneducated, lumbering, *blind* fool he will then be.~
@106  = ~Out of my way, would-be-poppy! Life is too short to listen to your endless laments.~
@107  = ~Barbarian born, how could an insignificant one such as you comprehend elegance in either speech or dress?~
@108  = ~But now that you have so rudely distracted me from my most important preoccupations, can you possibly curb your wild tongue and explain to me why you summon a dread wolf, if your spiritual animal is a raven? ~
@109  = ~The Great Mother decides whom to send to my call. I shall not question why she chose the wolf to come to my help. His blood runs as red as the raven's, and they both are my brothers.~
@110  = ~It can be assigned to the lack of proper training and basic intelligence then. Just as I thought. An educated conjurer (and especially one of such brilliance as I) knows precisely what is it he summons and why.~
@111  = ~Can you summon a raven, then?~
@112  = ~I see no reason to summon useless birds. Circus trickery is beneath me.~
@113  = ~Wizard! You will stop that blasphemous behavior immediately! You have killed a flower, monster!~
@114  = ~Eh? Killed? Flower? Are you quite insane? One must make use of whatever advantages are present, and it lies with the brightest of minds to find them even in the most precarious of conditions. (Such as trampling through the woods with no purpose for days and days on end.)~
@115  = ~I'll have you know that weed of yours is a very necessary spell component, and it will benefit us more in my pouch than it would balancing in the wind and pollinating, or whatever it is that flowers do.~
@116  = ~Foolish words! The advantage is an illusion when it is stolen from nature. The plant in your pouch will do nothing but satisfy your craving for power, while should it be left growing and flowering, it could sustain the life of an insect...~
@117  = ~(Or the digestion process of a cow. Which reminds me...)~
@118  = ~Your remark shows understanding of the Great Balance, yet you dare to disturb it?~
@119  = ~I disrupt nothing; all things are there to be of aid to the skilled. Flowers turn into components, trees into fire... I have even heard of a spell that lends the common domestic bovine some other use than steak.~
@120  = ~What... what do you mean? What other cruel fate was invented for the defenseless beasts?~
@121  = ~Have you heard of a spell ingeniously named Cow Kill? Of course you have not, how could I expect it from the likes of you? What it involves, in simple terms, so that the number of misunderstandings can be reduced to minimum, is a cow being dropped from the sky, on top of one's enemies. Quite effective, messy as it might seem.~
@122  = ~It is outrageous! Dropping an innocent cow to kill some petty human! And I thought that breeding for murder and obstructing the freedom of movement was criminal enough. I shall pass the information about this horrific practice to my brothers and sisters. We shall hunt down and execute anyone who dares to inflict such an abuse on poor animals. Excuse me, Edwin, I have messages to write.~
@123  = ~Of course. (Whatever gets her out of my way. Now for those gibberling larynxes...)~
@124  = ~It's not a ballroom, weakling. Step wider!~
@125  = ~By Oghma's scroll, this toad speaks! And of ballrooms too!~
@126  = ~Faldorn, when was the last time you attended a ball?~
@127  = ~I've never participated in such a folly of civilized madmen!~
@128  = ~And she is proud of it! How very amusing! Where does your profound knowledge of dancing steps come from, Faldorn? From observing drunk farmers prance about at a village fair?~
@129  = ~Farmers... I hate farmers! I never...~
@130  = ~May I presume that you have never seen people dancing? Yes, I thought so. Faldorn, I have danced a lot, I have even had the pleasure of dancing at the balls hosted by none other than Lord Piergeiron of Waterdeep.~
@131  = ~I promise you that many movements you'd see in the ballroom are quite wide and fast... like this one, for example... *Eldoth grabs a hold of Faldorn and swirls her around in a dancing pass.*~
@132  = ~*struggles and pants* Grrr! Leave me alone!~
@133  = ~Stupid wench! What use is a woman who cannot even dance? I bet you do not know how to do embroidery, either. I would teach you to dance, Faldorn... maybe... if you wash some.~
@134  = ~Grrrr!~
@135  = ~Faldorn! Please... put that club away! I was merely joking.~
@136  = ~Your perfume is going to destroy the world. Can't you see that flowers wither in your wake, and that birds faint even at the highest branches?~
@137  = ~I do use a bit more than usual, but it's because of all the awful smells around us. Bear dung, some rotting goblin corpses, these terrifying bushes in bloom... I am not accustomed to smelling such rough aromas.~
@138  = ~Plus I am getting a fit of hay fever on top of that! So if my perfume kills a flower or two, I say it's poetic justice.~
@139  = ~Now I know why I hate poetry!~
@140  = ~What I can never understand is the poet's desire to continuously compare human females' lips to corals. The throat bag of this little wood frog is just as red, if not redder.~
@141  = ~A throat bag? It can be as red as anything, but it so... phew... froggy. While corals are so romantic, so...~
@142  = ~Used?~
@143  = ~Even if it is a bit of a popular metaphor, it is better than to say "thine lips are red as the wood frog's throat bag..."~
@144  = ~I am no good judge of poetry, but how is that worse than "your lips are as red as skeletons of polyps..."~
@145  = ~Faldorn, you are completely... unrefined! The goblinoid's battle cries are wasted on you, let alone songs of love and beauty! How dare you announce your opinion on things you have no idea about?~
@146  = ~*snorts* That's coming from a guy who called a FOX's footprints a RABBIT's? The deep and fresh ones, too!~
@147  = ~Garrick! I know that you are an empty-headed bard, but that does not excuse you from littering the forest! You just dropped this!~
@148  = ~*blushes deeply* Faldorn! Give it back! This is a very private thing... I am trying painting... a little bit.~
@149  = ~Looks like an empty piece of parchment to me... though, wait! Here is a spot... what's that supposed to be? Oh! I know! A death of a mosquito? Very inspired. I knew that this tragic theme would be explored sooner or later by modern art. And finally this day has come!~
@150  = ~Ahem... actually, it was a portrait of an unknown beauty. I saw her in a dream as she walked past the seashore under the warm rain in her swirling plum-colored silks. The vision disappeared, and all that was left was a print of her little finger on the sand. Then I wept. That is the impression I wished to convey by this painting. Not some mosquito thing.~
@151  = ~Garrick, I never thought I would say this, but do stick with writing poetry, will you?~
@152  = ~Kador the Burner's spirit calls to me to make this group do more for the Great Mother's cause!~
@153  = ~Hmm... who's Kador the Burner?~
@154  = ~A great man. The Shadow Druid who could sway even farmers with his words. Those evil farmers who burn forests to rape the land with their plows and make abominations of wild animals and plants.~
@155  = ~I don't like farmers overly much. They always hide their money pouches deep in their clothes, and when you finally get to them there is nothing interesting in them, anyway. I prefer noble ladies - lots of coins, and their purses are easily accessible.~
@156  = ~But back to the Shadow Druid: so what did Kador do to the farmers?~
@157  = ~He made them burn their houses and crops to liberate their herds and return to nature.~
@158  = ~Oh, wow! What a weird lad! He should have let the herds eat the crops instead of burning them. Such a waste!~
@159  = ~Grrr!~
@160  = ~But he is a Shadow Druid, they are... hmmm... good at this sort of thing. Kador's spirit, how often does it talk to you, Faldorn?~
@161  = ~Often, very often.~
@162  = ~Maybe next time you should ask that spirit to talk to <CHARNAME>... or something.~
@163  = ~Imoen! This cockroach was on its way and did not display aggression. Why kill it?~
@164  = ~Because it's icky! and crawly, and dirty and disgusting!~
@165  = ~Do not be ridiculous, Imoen. You had a sudden strike of your killer instinct and wanted it for food, that must be it. You do not have to pretend with me, I am no degenerative townling.~
@166  = ~Food? I don't eat such things! It... they... live in manure! They are everywhere! Uh, there's another one! *splat* Please, Faldorn, please let go of my ear!~
@167  = ~Did you lose your wits completely? Or did these monks in the library alter your natural instincts so much that you misinterpret them? Animals you eat produce manure, in case it is not known in Candlekeep. Now be true to your nature and eat your kills. Before I splat *you* and feed you to their colony to compensate for the loss they endured from you.~
@168  = ~Hum... I'm... I'm not hungry! I'll eat them heh... later... Maybe we can share? What's a snack without... ahem... your flock?~
@169  = ~Now you are talking straight. It's always pleasing to put some townling's brains right and make her see the true way of things.~
@170  = ~Jaheira, I, for one, know well enough how to load a bullet into a sling. Can I be excused from listening to your instructions on that subject yet again?~
@171  = ~Everyone can profit from more training, while we are on the march. Otherwise you kids will waste your time in senseless banter, anyway.~
@172  = ~At least there will be something new to it, Jaheira.~
@173  = ~No, there won't! Your talk, for example, revolves around very few subjects. I emphasize: very few. You need to polish your conversational skills. While I understand your devotion to your druidical calling, however misguided your particular teachings might be, though of course you are by far too inexperienced...~
@174  = ~At least I have a calling! I am a druid! GRRRR!~
@175  = ~Hush, Faldorn, no need to be rude. As I was saying earlier, you are too young to know what you want to do with your life, exactly. Your decision to join the Shadow Druids, for example...~
@176  = ~At least I did not join the Order of the Most Annoying Marching Matrons, like you!~
@177  = ~I do understand the need for mating, but surely you could do better than this weakling?~
@178  = ~Even the green-grass wonder of a leader we have is better than Khalid.~
@179  = ~Do not ever dare call my Khalid a weakling! He has been through unthinkable tortures, insipid barbarian! He suffered much and has not yet recuperated.~
@180  = ~The hot depths of Toril birth solid rocks. A strong person comes through the trials and pain toughened, Jaheira.~
@181  = ~And so Khalid will with my help. I will transform him into the fearless man he once was.~
@182  = ~Want some advice? If you really desire to transform him permanently so much, do try transforming him into a turtle. It is easy, affordable, compact, sturdy and most importantly, his tongue might just catch up with his legs.~
@183  = ~Shut your mouth, witch! I am not obliged to listen to your stupidity.~
@184  = ~Aha! Then do not insist that I have to listen when *you* have a piece of mind to offer.~
@185  = ~Half-elf, half-human,
Half-wise, half-fool,
Half-druid – and no clue,
Of how to become full...~
@186  = ~You are no bard, Faldorn.~
@187  = ~I am a druid, and that is all I intend to be, unlike you.~
@188  = ~I serve the cause of nature, and I wish to win my battle. The Shadow Druids' vision of the Balance and the Great Mother is a distortion of the truth, Faldorn.~
@189  = ~You cannot force the people of Toril into a pre-civilized state! Your ilk is thousands of years too late for that. Civilization can't be destroyed, but we can and we must...~
@190  = ~No, you can't! You can half-have civilization, no more than you can leave a festering wound unhealed, claiming that it is not that large! Grrr!~
@191  = ~I hate dwarves! I hate the mines that they dig in their lust for gold, gems and metals!~
@192  = ~Ye blaspheme your own faith, wench. There's naught more natural than love of gold.~
@193  = ~The *lust* for gold is cursed! Nature is a temple, with blooming trees rising higher than any columns made by hand, with bird's songs and beast's voices praising Silvanus and the Great Mother, where every nature child's spirit soars.~
@194  = ~Yet in the race to get gold and wealth, civilized creatures destroy it!~
@195  = ~Har! Ye can pray to sticks and leaves, but don't be expecting such foolishness of me. Me coffer is me altar, and me coin pouch sings the sweetest hymns when shaken.~
@196  = ~That's why the champions of balance have to wage a constant war against the heretics who cherish not the Great Mother and will sell her off for a few coins!~
@197  = ~Nar! Land nay be so cheap as that. Costs gold and blood both to have and hold it. That's why we be on the same side here. This here Throne lot's put ye out a forest and me out of pocket.~
@198  = ~I... Silvanus will tell me when to fight you! For now you can live. The Oak Father wants you to fight for <CHARNAME>'s cause.~
@199  = ~Phah! Ye ain't even an honest thief yourself. Straining your leash to cut my throat afore the main job's even in sight. Tell you what. We both be standing aftertime, we can fight it out then, see who gets what.~
@200  = ~Agreed.~
@201  = ~Khalid, if I wanted to know your opinion on anything, I would talk to Jaheira. So stop looking at me like you want to talk to me.~
@202  = ~K-Kindness is often mistaken for stupidity, and love for lack of initiative. Too harshly you s-speak for the one so young.~
@203  = ~I do not get it. Do half-elves consider youthfulness some sort of a sin? All I hear from Jaheira is lectures about how inexperienced I am, and now you are doing the same?~
@204  = ~No, but the m-manner in which you speak shows you have much interest of the world ahead and little behind. You know n-nothing of the road Jaheira and I t-traveled, and still you presume to judge.~
@205  = ~What good is it to dwell on the past? I can see clearly that the present is pitiful.~
@206  = ~Those who k-keep an eye on the past are blind in one eye, but those who keep two eyes on the future are blind in both eyes, young one. Do not s-seek to cause wounds with your words. One s-skilled in the ways of nature should know the harm we c-cause shall be returned to us.~
@207  = ~That's true. Weakling you might be, but you possess some sense. Maybe you shall tell me one day about your past.~
@208  = ~Those are very p-private memories, Faldorn, and painful. The ones I would not share with anyone, b-but a good friend.~
@209  = ~Your wife and you should take: "My heart's really not in this!" as your family motto. Her heart is definitely not in nature's cause.~
@210  = ~You are unfair to J-Jaheira. I k-know her better than anyone else, and she is a d-devoted druid. I d-do not understand how people of the same faith can be so hateful of each other.~
@211  = ~Nothing infuriates a true believer more than a mere complier who pretends to be in your camp!~
@212  = ~F-faldorn, whatever you think, p-please be kinder when you talk to Jaheira. We are part of one group and do n-not need quarrels.~
@213  = ~Kinder? Mayhap I should be kinder and return the imposter of a druid to the Great Mother. I do not usually take pleasure in killing, but in this case...~
@214  = ~I warn you, Faldorn, that on the day you assault m-my wife you will stand against two, not one. I will f-fight you.~
@215  = ~Dull-eyes, I think you need it more than me. Here, hold it.~
@216  = ~An acorn? Thank you, milady. Might I ask why?~
@217  = ~Does it not cheer you up to hold a great oaken tree in your palm? It sure makes me happy!~
@218  = ~I threw acorns into Deheriana's grave when she started her journey to Arvanaith, to mark the place where the ashes went into the ground.~
@219  = ~I dream of coming back there after Tazok is dead and telling her that she is avenged. That is the only solace I've had since our ways parted. Thank you for reminding me of that, Faldorn.~
@220  = ~Let the beautiful young tree rise, and let its leaves whisper her name to you, once your oath is fulfilled.~
@221  = ~You have to abandon your unnatural ways, Kivan. Or should I pronounce you nature's enemy?~
@222  = ~How did I spur the Shadow Druid's wrath? I am hunting my prey, Faldorn. What can be more in agreement with nature than that?~
@223  = ~Your hunt is not what scares me about you. It's the solitude you impose on yourself. The springs come and go. Yet you keep denying the calls of potential mates. I'm afraid that I have no choice but to return you back to the proper ways.~
@224  = ~I am hardly the only beast on Toril who stays single after losing his mate. Swans mate for life, for example.~
@225  = ~You are right! There is a precedent in the natural world. I withdraw my concern.~
@226  = ~*quietly* Flies and maggots! Should have guessed that it won't work with a ranger before making a fool of myself!~
@227  = ~Why would a woodsman crave glory?~
@228  = ~Glory? Minsc does not look for glory, but glory finds Minsc! Glory for Minsc is glory for nature and all the little things that need rangers to kick the butts of evil in their name!~
@229  = ~Minsc, nature needs no glory! And its champions should follow suit.~
@230  = ~What about the morning glory? You know these pretty blue flowers? My fearsome companion feasts on them often. Nature needs them!~
@231  = ~You oaf! Alright, alright. Hamsters are a thing of nature. Let them roam in the early morning dew and eat a flower or two, but the minute glory of a bard's song and human's memory is naught to the eternal world.~
@232  = ~How can it be naught? Isn't nature good? There are trees to give Minsc shade in the hot sun. There is water when Boo is thirsty. When Minsc is thirsty, there is ale!~
@233  = ~What's ale have to do with it?~
@234  = ~It's good and wholesome. Like nature, and nature will not protest the heroic actions of its champions and the songs that are sung about them! Minsc and Boo! Onward!~
@235  = ~I thought to warn you that letting the hamster feed on the diseased xvart's blood can cause sever indigestion and other health problems. Consider restricting him from doing it, will you?~
@236  = ~But Boo likes blood and eyes! The druid is right, it is no diet for a regular hamster, but a Miniature Giant Space hamster is very different. Boo knows what he likes to eat.~
@237  = ~Ehm, of course... but the Miniature Giant Space part aside, he is still a hamster. Maybe you can offer him nuts or berries, while we are in the woods, and they are plentiful?~
@238  = ~Boo's mighty warrior spirit would go soft if fed with nuts and berries!~
@239  = ~I hate when it's your turn to cook, Montaron. I swear that you enjoy cutting deep into the flesh, and that you grin and chuckle when you imagine that even dead, the animals and vegetables can feel your knife.~
@240  = ~'Tis Xzar ye be mixing me with. That's him who's playin' wi' things beyond their death.~
@241  = ~You are little different from him, halfling. I suspect that you are an enemy of nature and enjoy killing and causing pain to living things.~
@242  = ~Go bark at someone else, if ye wants to eat tonight.~
@243  = ~My stomach grumbles for food already. But I'd rather shapeshift tonight and feast on a fresh kill than eat a piece of dead meat touched by your fingers.~
@244  = ~Suit yerself.~
@245  = ~Close it! Close it! Close your mouth immediately!~
@246  = ~Why would you be shouting at me in this most impolite way, Faldorn? My precious brain cannot be subjected to the stress you create!~
@247  = ~I had to attract your attention, gnome. You mouth is opened for such extended periods of time that I start to worry that some bird might mistake it for a hole in a tree stump and make a nest in there. And I am quite concerned about the well-being of birds.~
@248  = ~That will never happen, Faldorn. It is obvious that you can profit right now by imbibing of an amazing source of wisdom, such as I. I shall develop a theoretical model for you, which will prove your wild guesses all wrong.~
@249  = ~No pun intended, big woman, but with a brain as active as mine, the witticisms seem to come so naturally to my tongue.~
@250  = ~See that she-raven over there, Quayle? I can communicate with my spirit animal, and she just told me that if I'd pulled your tongue out, she'd have just enough space...~
@251  = ~This cannot be true. Firstly because it is theoretically impossible to fit that raven into my mouth. Secondly... ~
@252  = ~Care for a practical experiment?~
@253  = ~Quayle, your head looks pregnant again. No doubt you are nurturing another inane question. Spit it out!~
@254  = ~I was pondering on the druidical traditions. Let me ask you something, Faldorn. For the tree-hugging procedure, do druids choose exclusively oaks? *Must be* oaks, of course.~
@255  = ~I rather think that any generic vegetation is suitable when the mood strikes your mates.~
@256  = ~Does the age of the tree matter? Do you prefer the more mature specimens to the younger ones? I suspect the younger ones should work better, since then you can actually embrace it... Diameter, Faldorn, it's all in diameter.~
@257  = ~GRRRR!~
@258  = ~I assume that the presence of mistletoe on the hugged flora increases the oneness with the nature feeling.~
@259  = ~GRRRR! GRRRR! GRRRRRRRRRRRR!~
@260  = ~Yes, I thought that you'd agree. It is so pleasing to see how the power of my brain enables even such a barbaric creature as you most definitely are to participate in a highly sophisticated discussion.~
@261  = ~You are but a magpie in a gnome's body! As if it's not enough that you pester us through the day with your chatter, you also mumbled all through the night!~
@262  = ~I am berated in place of being praised! You have all benefited from the titanic works of my brain last night.~
@263  = ~The only benefit I got is a headache the size of the Spine of the World! Couldn't you count sheep like everyone else if insomnia tormented you?~
@264  = ~I thought about it, but a genius of my scale cannot be satisfied by mere addition that every child can do. Oh, no! If you only bothered to listen, instead of pulling blankets over your head and cursing, you'd witness the birth of the most advanced mathematical theory on sheep counting.~
@265  = ~So I got a headache because of something as useless as a mathematical theory?~
@266  = ~It's not really useless...~
@267  = ~*quickly* Say, Faldorn, what do sheep do when they have trouble sleeping?~
@268  = ~Why, they count gnomes, of course!~
@269  = ~Safana, I need your mirror.~
@270  = ~Daarling, why would YOU need a mirror? If I were you, I would be staying as far away from any reflecting surface as possible.~
@271  = ~Snakes and leeches! Just give me the stupid mirror!~
@272  = ~And while we are on the matter of your sorry appearance, green is so not your color... Gods, see, you are looking much like a toad, anyway, without it - here, maybe you DO need a mirror after all.~
@273  = ~Grrr! I mean, thanks.~
@274  = ~What are you doing with my mirror! It is very elaborately done! Stop it! Is there a paladin to help a poor defenseless beauty being robbed of her treasures?~
@275  = ~Stop yelling like a moose in the peak of the mating season! Look - I am just using your mirror to throw a beam of light in the nest of this white burrowing owl. I need to count the chicks, not deafen them.~
@276  = ~Oh... cute little daaarlings, and all so white... Can I have one? I did give you my mirror.~
@277  = ~*coldly* Step back. Do not dare touch a single feather, vermin!~
@278  = ~Grrr! When you stare at me like that, I think you are challenging me to a fight!~
@279  = ~You are sooo mean, Faldorn. You did not let me take a single one of those chicks. I have never seen any like that before...~
@280  = ~You have. In feather shawls.~
@281  = ~Oh, the feather shawls - I saw one in Calimshan, it looked like it was woven of snowflakes. Awesome!~
@282  = ~Owl-some... more like. It takes a hundred of the chicks killed and plucked to a feather to make one.~
@283  = ~That's... that's terrible. A hundred? Are you sure, daarling?~
@284  = ~Roughly. But the chick-hunters are only one sort of criminal which need to be stopped in order to give the owls a chance. There are farmers who clear the forest leaving them homeless and hungry... Farrrrrmerrrrrrs!~
@285  = ~What, what is it?~
@286  = ~After all this owl talk, I felt like doing something to help your struggle against people who kill nice fluffy chicks. So I decided to donate you my nail file.~
@287  = ~A... nail file? Oh! You think that I can cut throats of despicable hunters with a nail file without denouncing my druid's vows against bladed weapons? I'd rather have a scimitar.~
@288  = ~I... I did not think about it that way, Faldorn. But... You see, it is very, very important for a person to be presentable when she tries to call for men to fight for her cause.~
@289  = ~Which you will undeniably have to do. You are hopeless, and of course you will never look a hundredth part as elegant as me, but one needs to start somewhere. I suggest the dirt under your nails as a first step. Or maybe cleaning that erm... whatever is that you are wearing...~
@290  = ~Oh, who cares! What is less than an inch thick is no dirt, and what's more will fall off on its own.~
@291  = ~Townling you are, but no weakling.~
@292  = ~The city-dweller needs to be as tough as the one born in the wilderness, Faldorn. The jungles of Chult and Maztica are no more full of predators than the back alleys of Baldur's Gate.~
@293  = ~You suggest that the same laws govern the townlings and the beasts of the jungle?~
@294  = ~I do not *suggest*. I *know* it. Eat or be eaten! Kill or be killed! I'd rather be among hunters. In that I took classes from Ysena herself!~
@295  = ~But you do not know who Ysena was, do you?~
@296  = ~No.~
@297  = ~Ysena was the most famous female mercenary in Baldur's Gate, and some say the most dangerous predator in the city's jungles.~
@298  = ~Before I killed her.~
@299  = ~So, you are a predator yourself. I respect that. I sense that you are one of those townlings who will survive after civilization is destroyed.~
@300  = ~My father, Angelo Dosan, did enough wandering in the wilderness of Chult and Anchorome for my whole family, Faldorn. Cities attract me more than wilderness.~
@301  = ~Tell me more of the ritual of challenging men you have performed when joining with <CHARNAME>. Is that the way of your tribe?~
@302  = ~*grins* It is MY way, Faldorn, and nobody else's. I am of the opinion that all males are slugs who need to be taught a lesson in humility.~
@303  = ~Nature has purpose equally for males and females. You cannot destroy one or the other without disturbing the Great Balance.~
@304  = ~Bah, I don't care a fig for high purposes. I do what I want and to the Nine Hells with the Great Balance! If I enjoy killing men, I'll kill men.~
@305  = ~And they call Umberlee the Bitch Queen! I'd say you could claim her title any day you choose.~
@306  = ~Balance should be restored at any cost.~
@307  = ~You seem to want this "balance" very badly, druid. I don't get it. Why would you waste your effort on such meaningless pursuit?~
@308  = ~It's ultimate harmony, Shar-Teel. It's the world where civilizations do not prey on the wilderness, it's the world where every beast lives its life to its fullest and is guided by the hand of the Great Mother.~
@309  = ~*conceals a yawn* You have that fighter's spirit in you, Faldorn, but I'd like you much more if you weren't into that gibberish about ideals and "balance". Can't you just slay our foes and be happy with the blood spilled?~
@310  = ~That *gibberish*, Shar-Teel, is the reason why I fight! I will put it ahead of everything else. Ahead of the virtues that civilized people brag so much about: mercy, pity, honor and such. Ahead of wealth and knowledge. Ahead of my life.~
@311  = ~You place your goal above mercy and pity; that's fine with me. But to place anything above yourself is stupidity. Perhaps one day you will learn this, and become a true warrior. Until then, you are a slave to your own "ideals".~
@312  = ~Listen, Skie, that male specimen you are mated to...~
@313  = ~Ah! Would everyone please, please, please stop telling me stupid things like that! Mating! Eldoth is-~
@314  = ~Not the strongest, fastest and brightest male human in the vicinity. Make him fight with someone for mating privileges, and you will see that quite clearly.~
@315  = ~Eldoth does NOT have to fight for me! He won my heart with his poetry!~
@316  = ~Poetry... if that is what you want, strange as it may seem, then I am sure you can force one of those stallions to write a line or two. With hips that wide, it should not be a problem.~
@317  = ~My... my... hips...~
@318  = ~Yes, you'll have no troubles giving birth, methinks. And your breast shows a potential for producing enough milk to feed the offspring. That always attracts the males.~
@319  = ~How can you be so primitive! Even for a barbarian... I am attractive to males, yes, but NOT because of the size of my... hips or my ability to milk... It is my intelligence, kind heart, and adventurous demeanor that makes me so desirable.~
@320  = ~Who taught you about males, Skie? Some bard?~
@321  = ~I can tell you a thing that will give you nightmares.~
@322  = ~The necessity to bear your company alone gives me nightmares, Faldorn. You are a scary sort.~
@323  = ~For you to wear this silken tunic, thousands of wrinkled hairless yellowish caterpillars were forced to spin the thread for their cocoons fruitlessly for months...~
@324  = ~The silkworms crawling all over me. Brrr... I am going to put on a linen shirt and hope that will not inspire you to discuss some larva or another.~
@325  = ~*mutters darkly under her nose* Look at this puffed up gnome! That's what civilization does to people. All townlings will be in his state sooner or later. Dreaming of nothing but power over others and yelling senselessly.~
@326  = ~What are you babbling about? The great Tiax is role model to the whole world! Everyone should be striving to become just like Tiax! Those who are not at all like Tiax should bow their heads in worship and keep silent when Tiax passes! Cyric's revenge will be swift on those who don't obey!~
@327  = ~I will be *very* content if all enemies of nature will become like Tiax, I will. To grant us victory, render them mad, Oak Father!~
@328  = ~Mad? MAD? Tiax is not mad! Tiax has more sense in his boot than the crow wench has in her head!~
@329  = ~*smiles darkly* Of course.~
@330  = ~The great forest stands around us.~
@331  = ~When Tiax rules, this forest will be lumber for but a leg of his throne!~ [%tutu_var%TIAXX12]
@332  = ~Gnome, an ant will climb to the top of the Spine of the World before you will climb a leg made of these sentinel trees. Besides, I will maim anyone who tries so much as to break a single branch.~
@333  = ~The Spine of the World is but an ant mound for the great Tiax! When Tiax rules he will make you cut down all the stupid woods to punish you for your insolence!~
@334  = ~*scowls* Really? ~
@335  = ~Yes! Mighty Tiax will punish you! Every tree! Every deer! Every grass blade! It will all be destroyed when Tiax rules! It's a good idea actually, since that will make it easier for Tiax to observe his slaves when the world is barren.~
@336  = ~Then I must make sure that you will never rule, gnome.~
@337  = ~Treason! High treason!~
@338  = ~Away from me! Nature demands I tolerate your presence for the moment, but cross me, and I swear I'll fertilize the forests with your innards when our task is done!~
@339  = ~Tiax pays no heed! The forests will all bow to Tiax some day, just as you will!~
@340  = ~Ignorant fool. Nature will strike down those who dare try to command her. The Shadow Druids will see to it.~
@341  = ~Then Tiax will slap some sense into Nature! If you wish your forests to still stand when Tiax rules, you will bend knee and serve him now before he has them chopped down for collectible knick-knacks! Your precious trees will look oh-so-much better as adorable little wooden reindeer on Tiax's shelf!~
@342  = ~*angrily mumbling under her breath* You can't kill him now, Faldorn. The Oak Father has a greater purpose. You can't kill him now, Faldorn. The Oak Father has a greater purpose...~
@343  = ~These wretched hovels, made from once-living trees ruthlessly cut to the ground, and stone, torn from the side of the mountain. Let the Oak Father grant me sufficient power, and I will erase this scab from the face of nature, and hunt its inhabitants to extinction!~
@344  = ~You will do no such thing! Tiax does not will these people to be butchered. How are they to worship him, when you've killed them all!? Tiax needs warm bodies to bend knee to his glory!~
@345  = ~I care nothing for your delusions of worship. For their rape of nature, all these people must be returned to the Great Mother for cleansing. The Shadow Druids will one day see to it!~
@346  = ~I do not care for cities, either, but your fantasies are as much an affront to nature, as any of these buildings you so despise. Nature's children do not dream of massacre, and only a perversion of nature's servitors such as your "Shadow Druids" would believe in such stupidity.~
@347  = ~I have no time for weaklings who believe that mankind can live in the cities and not abuse nature. We are nature's only true defenders. Our cause is just and holy, and we shall not fail.~
@348  = ~Bah! Shadow Druids! Any group which attempts to exterminate Tiax's herd of slaves without his express consent will fall before his might!~
@349  = ~Tell your Shadow Druids to come beg aid from Tiax, and perhaps he might let you kill a few of them, but unless he grows extremely bored it's unlikely Tiax will ever let you exterminate ALL of his people.~
@350  = ~*sigh* Nature is being rent asunder, and here I spend my days arguing with madmen...~
@351  = ~Drow, what are you scowling at the wild strawberries for?~
@352  = ~I have little use for fresh fruit, if you must know. My stomach is not used to them yet, and they are an endless source of displeasure. I loathe the smell and that improbably bright red color.~
@353  = ~If you need to scowl at fruits, go scowl on those terrible abominations the humans have produced by torturing the wild berries. But back off from those poor, innocent...~
@354  = ~Selective breeding is commendable. Perhaps it should be practiced more often.~
@355  = ~Selective killing is far better in my opinion, as it achieves the same goal and at the same time reduces the pressure imposed on the nature by the so-called "thinking" races.~
@356  = ~Always trust a female to think beyond the meager limits imposed by the false pretense you surfacers call 'morality'. I could not find a statement truer myself. Indeed, indeed. If there is one thinking race which should be left to rule the world...~
@357  = ~Wrong! RRRGGHHH!~
@358  = ~And this race is Drow. You can yell all you want, wael, but it does not make my words any less true. Drow are superior to any other race and therefore should rule Toril sooner or later.~
@359  = ~There is one thing I find quite unnatural about you, drow. You do not stink of sweat, even if we walk for miles, and you keep complaining of how hot you are in what you so imaginatively call "the surface inferno".~
@360  = ~Unlike you, ignorant humans, my ancient race knows that water is not a carrier of diseases, but rather a preventer of many. Why lose moisture in such a stupid way?~
@361  = ~So all drow do not sweat?~
@362  = ~Insufferable wael! I do not know, I never sweated. Though, of course, should drow sweat, the smell of that would be sweeter than the terrifying concoctions humans pour on themselves to obscure the vile and sour stink that oozes from their pores.~
@363  = ~Now will you leave me alone?~
@364  = ~I wonder if that is a feature all elves have in common or did drow develop it after they have migrated to the Underdark?~
@365  = ~I have never been so insulted in my life! How dare you to compare me to an elf!~
@366  = ~Polar bear has a white coat and the black bear – the black, yet both are bears in the end...~
@367  = ~Why does everyone picture drow males as mean looking? I think they must be at least a bit effeminate.~
@368  = ~Effeminate! How dare you! Males are nothing compared to females, they are... ibilith, rubbish... *spits and mutters under her breath in Drow*~
@369  = ~Is that true that drow males are smaller in size than drow females?~
@370  = ~Yes, of course. Females are stronger and taller.~
@371  = ~Among my race, the opposite is true. So to me a drow male will appear effeminate.~
@372  = ~Do not talk to me about surface customs! Here the females are craven and subservient. Here the males are arrogant and insolent. It is all wrong!~
@373  = ~You whiner, you complainer, you useless weakling! Why do you dread every task? Even if we meet with our death – what's so terrible about that? Death is only a stage in the great cycle of life. Our end is the beginning of something or somebody else.~
@374  = ~The untimely death awaits all of us, and I am not afraid of it. Wherever it finds me, I am prepared to die. Yet it is foolish to seek one's end actively. The world is doomed as is, why speed up the inevitable?~
@375  = ~The world is doomed only if corrupted townlings have their dark way with it. The Shadow Druids will not let it happen! Instead of howling at the moon, Xan, you should be helping us!~
@376  = ~Me joining in the cause of barbaric fanatics, who arrogantly believe that they are destined to save the world? Pardon me dearly, Faldorn, but no, I have no desire to partake in such a folly. You and your wild comrades shall perish quicker than the rest, thanks to your pointless struggle.~
@377  = ~If you live long enough to gain any measure of understanding of the nation's history, you will see that Shadow Druids are not the first to claim to be the save-us-all champions, they will not be the last, and they will not succeed.~
@378  = ~We are trying to preserve the balance, and we are not shy of any means. We are bound to succeed, even if many of us should lose our lives in the process! It's better to die trying than to die crying! Grrr!~
@379  = ~In my opinion it's better to die later than sooner. And one way to ensure it is to join a less hopeless cause, rather than the more hopeless one.~
@380  = ~Why, even the mad enterprise we are engaged in now is less likely to bring our demise upon us, than the most sane of Shadow Druid's schemes.~
@381  = ~Xan, can I take another look at the Moonblade? That moonstone on the hilt reminds me of the lake in my home grove. Just as round and blue.~
@382  = ~Why not? Everyone has seen it already, why not a druid who thinks that the moonstone is amusing.~
@383  = ~Wondrous weapon!~
@384  = ~*sighs*~
@385  = ~Aren't you proud of it? I have heard that swords like that select their owners, and it's a great honor to own one.~
@386  = ~It is a great honor - yes, but the responsibility is greater still. As my hand wields it, the blade tests my soul. It asks me if I stand ready to defend Evereska from all that are against her. And honor does not render one invincible. I am so tired of being chosen to fight the hopeless battle, Faldorn.~
@387  = ~Many think that when the great druid, Kador the Burner, became tired of his mission, he simply returned to the Great Mother and left his magical scimitar for his heir to find. Maybe that's what you should do, too.~
@388  = ~It will happen soon enough, Faldorn. I will be defeated by one of those monstrous adversaries we face, and the Moonblade will go dormant. It will be lost to Elvendom then, alas, unless a new champion arises to wield it. Who knows, maybe it's the best way.~
@389  = ~That's exactly what will happen to Kador's scimitar – the Emerald Ray. I'll find it, and I will be the new champion of Balance!~
@390  = ~*sighs* Be cautious with what you wish for, Faldorn, for your desires can come true.~
@391  = ~*mutters under her nose, watching Xzar suspiciously* That Necromancer seems to be plotting something against rabbits. How great must be the need for balance if something so deeply evil was created into the world!~
@392  = ~What? Rabbits? Why are you talking about rabbits?~
@393  = ~I know dragons with feet like rabbits! 'Tis true, I swear!~ [%tutu_var%XZAR37]
@394  = ~*slowly* I know people, mainly of knightly demeanor, whose sole dream in life is to kill dragons. Do you feel the same way about rabbits?~
@395  = ~No, I do not think about rabbits in that way. I try not to think about rabbits at all. Or hares.~
@396  = ~Try harder, Xzar. I do not like that feverish gleam in your eyes, when anyone mentions rabbits.~
@397  = ~Ahhh, Undead skeleton bunnies, bereft of allergenic fur and disgusting entrails... There's a thought to put a smile on your lips and a song in your heart!~
@398  = ~*spits* The bunch of cretins.~
@399  = ~Yeslick, your clan have defiled nature, and it threw the things terrible and evil at your pass. Do you not want to carry this message to other dwarves? ~
@400  = ~By Clangeddin's beard, lass, me clan never wronged a thing o' nature! ~
@401  = ~No race is greedier than yours, and it is nature who gives you the wealth. You burn the trees for fuel and dig the galleries and tunnels deep, and convert the body of our mother into shiny metal toys.~
@402  = ~What do ye think the Nature intended metals fer? For hidin' in its womb?~
@403  = ~The rocks are root of mountains and the floor of the valleys.~
@404  = ~But change and purge o' the roots is the way o' nature.~
@405  = ~The uprooted plant dies.~
@406  = ~As the flowers and trees o' the surface wither ta be born again, so the metal's taken out so new metal can be created.~
@407  = ~It does not work that way, Yeslick. For the dead plant returns to mother, but your worked metal does not.~
@408  = ~I am merely trying to point out that folding it horizontally rather than vertically will allow for more space in your backpack, nothing more.~
@409  = ~But this way allows me to roll more potions into it, Jaheira, I have been doing so for as long as I has been on the road.~
@410  = ~That does not make it right. Do you think that bottles will not crash against each other if they are huddled near in the blanket?~
@411  = ~Grrrr! Alright! I am going to unroll it and show you how I placed the vials! Do you see now that each is individually wrapped in my socks?~
@412  = ~Well... I guess that would make sense. But it only goes to prove you carry too many clothes around.~
@413  = ~By snakes and leeches! One can never have enough socks!~
