@0    = ~Xzar? I am amazed at your effrontery.~
@1    = ~However, <CHARNAME>, your presence puts a better face on the matter. I have gleaned enough of your activities - not from Xzar's miserable reports but from witnesses who gladly expounded upon your feats - that I am pleased. Indeed, I must say I am impressed... to a degree.~
@2    = ~I've a feeling I would be impressed in turn... if I knew who you are.~
@3    = ~Ah. You would be the representative of the Zhentarim, I take it.~
@4    = ~You are superior to Xzar? In what way? Not lunacy, I hope.~
@5    = ~Truly? Xzar has been more discrete that I had dared imagine. I am the Master of the Zhentarim upon the Sword Coast.~
@6    = ~*sighs* If I ever desire publicity on a matter, I need only tell Xzar and swear him to secrecy. Yes, I am the Master of Zhentarim on the Sword Coast.~
@7    = ~Hardly. Though I do not wonder at your warped judgment from such an example. Know then that I am Master of the Zhentarim on the Sword Coast.~
@8    = ~The obverse of your arithmetic is that the present want of involvement measures the scope of future opportunity. Do not forget that, halfling.~
@9    = ~As for you, <CHARNAME>, know that our common enemy here is no less a foe than the Iron Throne. From their hall in the western part of the city they yet conspire against us all. Put an end to their heinous crimes, and your reward shall be the high favor of the Zhentarim.~
@10   = ~Your restraint, for one so young, is commendable, <CHARNAME>. At least, I hope it was restraint and not cowardice. Never mind. Go now and mete the same justice to the Iron Throne that we have delivered to the ... remains, there. And take the halfling with you, if you like.~
@11   = ~Oho! 'Tis the halfling, Mountebank, if my eyes...~
@12   = ~Come now, this is a better tale. <CHARNAME>, poor Xzar spoke well of you, while able to do so, and witnesses to your deeds have been eloquent in your praise to our messengers. I bid you welcome here.~
@13   = ~I thank you, and would like to know what company I'm keeping.~
@14   = ~Thank you. It is a pleasant change to meet a responsible representative of the Zhentarim.~
@15   = ~So you're the head Zhent, huh? Seems the Thronies caught you napping here.~
@16   = ~Save your perky arithmetical sallies for the taproom, halfling, and attend.~
@17   = ~Seems to me a more tangible payment wouldn't be out of place.~
@18   = ~My thanks. I could ask no more.~
@19   = ~I look forward to finding out what that means precisely.~
@20   = ~The half-successful may expect nothing. Ask Xzar about that, should you meet him again. Succeed entirely, and you will not be disappointed.~
@21   = ~Of course. I am Niemain, the Master of the Zhentarim on the Sword Coast.~
@22   = ~Be an impressive title if there was more'n ten o' us here... counting the five in this room.~
@23   = ~Hmmm. Clearly, you knew poor Xzar... hem. Permit me, I am Niemain, the Master of the Zhentarim on the Sword Coast.~
@24   = ~Hardly napping. A competitor simply pre-invested greater resources first in this barbarous land. It merely emphasizes the opportunities for a properly staffed... but you are not interested in our administrative tortuosities. I am Niemain, the Master of Zhentarim on the Sword Coast.~
@25   = ~Montaron, an it please yer. Or even if it don't.~
@26   = ~Whichever. What matters is that you seem to have lost our dear friend, Xzar, and substituted this riffraff in his stead.~
@27   = ~Pfeh! He were too crazy and too slow t' be savin'. Whereas <CHARNAME> here...~
@28   = ~Whew! That's tore it! We better ferget the Throne and start lookin' fer a hole to hide in.~
@29   = ~I know the perfect hole for you, Monty!~
@30   = ~If that's the way you feel, why'd you side with us, then?~
@31   = ~'Cause I figgered ye looked a winner in this room here, and I wanted t' walk out o' it. But... ah, can't be helped now. We talk to the bosses with Throne scalps on our belts, maybe they won't take it so bad. 'Specially since ain't nobody apt to contradict what we tells 'em.~
@32   = ~Be an impressive title if there was more'n ten o' us here... counting the six in this room.~
@33   = ~Face it down, mush! No other hope for either o' us. No one back east is gonna know aught, but what *we* tell 'em, anyways.~
@34   = ~REWARD??? Is THAT what you call it? To be shunted aside, ignored, shorn of help and lacking in bath oils? <CHARNAME>, not all of us are like this pig, I swear it! Well, not much like him...~
@35   = ~Um... oh, yes. <CHARNAME>, help me kill this wretched fool, and I shall succeed to the Mastery, *and* I will be your friend for life! However long that may be...~
@36   = ~Sorry, Xzar. You started this, you're going to finish it. On your own.~
@37   = ~Ahhh, the devil I know, I guess... let's do it, Xzar!~
@38   = ~HA! HA! I have done it! The bootheel is gone! I shall... shall... <CHARNAME>, what have you done?~
@39   = ~You have slain the Master of Zhentarim, and I... I will be blamed for it! Why is life so unfair?!?~
@40   = ~That unfair, eh? Then I shall relieve you of its burden, the better to silence your lying tongue.~
@41   = ~Relax! How are your bosses going to know anything but what you tell them?~
@42   = ~Eh?... that might play... Of course! I shall report that we came here and found them in this deplorable state. Our enemies must have done it! My genius has triumphed again! <CHARNAME>, to the Iron Throne!~
@43   = ~Sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@44   = ~XZAR! What the... you just green slimed that girl! You promised to save that for an *important* target!~
@45   = ~Mummy... mummy said do it... and... and I did. I think we might move on now.~
@46   = ~What a lovely crop this rustic has produced. And to think that, in my pride, I had always disdained bucolic venues.~
@47   = ~Are you cra... out of your... Xzar! The place is full of zombies, and they're trying to kill us!~
@48   = ~Marvelous, aren't they? It's not their fault they're trying to kill us, after all. They just weren't made correctly.~
@49   = ~D'you know, <CHARNAME>, that *is* rather a handsome weapon. Obviously, effective as well...~
@50   = ~Forget it, Xzar. Yes, we *might* make another revenant with it, but no, we have *not* got the time to hang around each corpse until the result becomes obvious.~
@51   = ~'Haste and Waste,' <CHARNAME>, is thy name henceforward.~
@52   = ~Alas! The wondrous jar... shattered to fragments. So like my dreams... and still more like my waking hours. Come, <CHARNAME>, let us depart this melancholy scene.~
@53   = ~A pity to waste such a resource. Perhaps we'd best seek an alternative point of egress. I had forgotten how slime multiplies - like cute, little bunny rabbits, heeheehee!~
@54   = ~Dear Monty. You are much less troublesome now. You eat less, smell better and never contradict me or say rude things any longer. Yes, I should have killed you ages ago; your companionship is far more pleasant this way.~
@55   = ~*Brief pause follows. Xzar inclines his head as if listening to something.*~
@56   = ~Why, thank you, Monty... You, too. ~
@57   = ~<CHARNAME>, now that we've caught such a bird, wouldn't it be suitable to celebrate with a piquant roasted chicken with chestnut dressing and a small salad?~
@58   = ~Dunno about that. He felt kind of tough for roasting, when I hoisted him into the sack.~
@59   = ~Xzar, this is no chicken, but a man! A wizard's apprentice. We are not eating him.~
@60   = ~Tough, eh?~
@61   = ~Like a feathered rock, actually.~
@62   = ~Tough luck, Xzar.~
@63   = ~Ugh. Then you are correct; we had best abstain. Eats first, Evil afterwards.~
@64   = ~You precipitate fool! You've killed him!~
@65   = ~Sure. He was trying to kill *me*, wasn't he?~
@66   = ~Well, yeah...~
@67   = ~One ogre mage subtracted doesn't matter, granted. But... ~
@68   = ~But? ~
@69   = ~*roll your eyes* ~
@70   = ~I do not want to talk about it.~
@71   = ~Now I'll never know how he concocted the reagent for the wasting sickness from these blasted millipedes!~
@72   = ~Huh. That gunk was too slow-acting to do *us* any good.~
@73   = ~What a loss for the civilization!~
@74   = ~Hurry, hurry, hurry! When *will* you learn, <CHARNAME>, that 'slooowly' may induce a far more salutary terror in one's victims?~
@75   = ~How enticing these bodies look. Like candied fruits in a cake.~
@76   = ~Er, Xzar, have you ever considered... um... professional help?~
@77   = ~How observant! And the blood is just like jam...~
@78   = ~*sigh* Whatever.~
@79   = ~Just the once and never again, I swear. If you can credit it, the lying dogs wanted to change *me* rather than HELP!~
@80   = ~Hmmm... Schlumpsha's dead?~
@81   = ~Uh, Xzar, what are you doing?~
@82   = ~You are collecting bits of that monster in one of your jars. Aren't you?~
@83   = ~Xzar, I am leaving... ~
@84   = ~Nothing! Uh... no delay... catch you up in no time.~
@85   = ~Uh... well... generally speaking...Um... yes.~
@86   = ~Dare I ask *why* you are putting little pieces of Schlumpsha into your jar?~
@87   = ~Yakes! That's DISGUSTING! I'm leaving... ~
@88   = ~Ah... a little exhibit... for a lecture and... a paper I was planning... for the Necromancers' Annual Review.~
@89   = ~Uh-huh. You're planning to throw that at someone, aren't you, Xzar? Little ‘Instant Green Puddle in a Jar'?~
@90   = ~Ye gods! A lecture on slime... We need to go, Xzar.~
@91   = ~Oh... ah... Not at YOU!!! I mean... it just did cross my mind... a missile... only for the most extreme emergency! And...and a most worthy target. You'll let me keep it, won't you, <CHARNAME>? Pleeease?~
@92   = ~Great. I just get used to having an insane necromancer behind me, and now I've got an insane necromancer with a pocketful of green slime. Still behind me. Xzar, I want you to promise something...~
@93   = ~You use that on Sarevok and only Sarevok and *only* at a distance, so none of *us* gets splashed with it.~
@94   = ~Well... Keep it out of my sight. I might get tempted, when Jaheira nags me yet again...~
@95   = ~Right... I can see your point. Sometimes Imoen's giggling puts me on the verge of – Never MIND, Xzar. Do not throw it at *anybody* in this group!~
@96   = ~Oh! I will! I do! I promise! I promise!~
@97   = ~Well... Keep it out of my sight. I might get tempted when Jaheira nags me yet again...~
@98   = ~Of course. Really, <CHARNAME>, sometimes you speak as though you believe I have no common sense at all.~
@99   = ~So many simple things amaze you, what does one more matter?~
@100  = ~Watch your tongue or lose it! Who are these people with you?~
@101  = ~Ecch! Seeing you again has blasted by manners. These are my serva... uh... colleagues in my task. <CHARNAME>, <PLAYER2>, <PLAYER3>, <PLAYER4>, <PLAYER5>, <PLAYER6>...~
@102  = ~Xzar, I know *you* and Montaron... why did you introduce yourself and the halfling?~
@103  = ~Xzar, I know *you* and Montaron... appears to be not entirely with us. Why did you introduce yourself and the dead halfling?~
@104  = ~Xzar, I know *you*, and Montaron... appears to be missing. Why did you introduce yourself and the absent halfling?~
@105  = ~Why, for conspiracy, of course. And this is Niemain, my... colleague...~
@106  = ~I am your superior! We will discuss your attitude and your performance more fully at a later date. Do be assured of that!~
@107  = ~Just a moment here! Surely you can't be all *that* hurried...~
@108  = ~I... sssensse... mage... necrromancerrr... ssspeak, then.~
@109  = ~You've got a really lovely setup here; dissolve minds and wills, but not bodies. Fascinating! How do you do that in your... condition?~
@110  = ~Heehee. Admirrration isss rreal... I hurrt... Jjoin, and you willll sssee.~
@111  = ~Don't be absurd! If I wanted to *join*, I'd just dive in, wouldn't I? I want to know how *you* do it, not participate, myself.~
@112  = ~Sssecret cannot be sshared with those of forrrm... but... yourrr thoughts ssspin... cause Ssschlumpssha grreat pain... lllike pink, vorpall bunny rrrabbits... cannot endurrre... AARRGH! I musst END you now!~
@113  = ~Sssecret cannot be sshared with those of forrrm... but... yourrr thoughts ssspin...~
@114  = ~Hmph. One of mortality's pimps. Or jesters. Both. Neither. No matter, he is of no importance in death's great scheme of things. ~
@115  = ~I have no time for philosophy.~
@116  = ~D'you know, Monty, the old hag's reaction gives me pause. I wonder... just wonder, mind... if our young friend's dreams are the product of something other than a disorderly adolescence.~
@117  = ~Ooh! And a pretty jar, too. Where did you steal it?~
@118  = ~I will. Give it to me, and I'll say the name. And... then I'll hide inside the jar myself until whatever I summoned is dead.~
@119  = ~Oh, I don't think so.~
@120  = ~Hang it, boy. You've got all the family together again and didn't invite ME to the party.~
@121  = ~Wha.. NO! We're all here. We are!~
@122  = ~We are - now that *I* have arrived!~
@123  = ~Who are you?~
@124  = ~Who... er... I... I am your DOOM, lad!~
@125  = ~UNCLE LESTER!!!~
@126  = ~Uh... yes, it is I, your Uncle Lester! In person!~
@127  = ~Oooohhh...~
@128  = ~There. You see, <CHARNAME>, bamboozling this wretched lunatic into a state of quiescence wasn't so difficult...~
@129  = ~YOU'RE NOT UNCLE LESTER! If you were, I'd be dead now! So...~
@130  = ~What crimes against nature would those be, yelling man?~
@131  = ~Hear ye! Hear ye! The mad cleric of Cyric defiles nature! He turned living in the walking corpses and lives with them as they are his family! Fear him!~
@132  = ~<CHARNAME>, that fellow Bassilus - the living one - sounds a bit odd; almost... deranged.~
@133  = ~Hear ye! Hear ye! Here comes the man to straighten him out!~
@134  = ~Well... vertically, perhaps, but yes. He seems to have no respect at all for his handiwork.~
@135  = ~Heh, for me 5,000 gold would be motivation enough to finish him off, if I was an adventurer! Heh, sorry, back to work!~
@136  = ~Hear ye! Hear ye! By order of his Most Radiant of Lathander Kelddath Ormlyr, governor of Beregost, and in the best interest of its peoples-~
@137  = ~<CHARNAME> can handle most things, and dear Monty here is as hard to kill as a cockroach. And you... you can hide in the jar with me!~
@138  = ~<CHARNAME> can handle most things, and <PRO_HESHE> is as hard to kill as a cockroach. And you... you can hide in the jar with me!~
@139  = ~Fool! You are more mad even than Carsa! Death will fit you well! KAHRK!~
@140  = ~OH MIGHTY KAHRK!!!~
@141  = ~Silly creature. You're undead already, and have eternity at your command. Why such impatience?~
@142  = ~Haaaatred... hatred called me back... the dagger... it slew me... any who has it... akin to my murderer... and MUST DIE!~
@143  = ~Such a limited thing, poor dear. And yet totally unamenable to control.~
@144  = ~Fascinating...~
@145  = ~Noooo discussion... RETURN UNTO MEEE! Or I fascinate on your throat for you.~
@146  = ~Oh! Still, if we gave the dagger back, it would probably disappear just to spite me... prolonged study seems out of the question... what do you think, <CHARNAME>?~
@147  = ~Slythe, honey! What's that racket?~
@148  = ~Sounds rather as though some prudish fool of a mage has dropped green slime on one of the girls again, Krystin, baby.~
@149  = ~Oooo! Can we watch?~
@150  = ~In a bit, perhaps. That doltish lack of originality occasions a hope that our guests have arrived. We cannot be so inconsiderate as to ignore them for lesser amusements.~
@151  = ~Oooo, Slythe. Your think-piece is the second best piece about you. You know that, don't you, darling?~
@152  = ~Of course. ~
@153  = ~Let's kill them quick, then. I want to go watch!~
@154  = ~Hey, magic man, wanna good time? I know spells you never heard of.~
@155  = ~Ah... no... er... no, thank you.~
@156  = ~Don't be shy, wiz. Ignorance is bad, and I'll learn you real sweetly.~
@157  = ~No... please...~
@158  = ~Awww, itty boy scared? I'm not some big, bad scawy monster, am I?~
@159  = ~You... will... be!~
@160  = ~SHRIEEEKK!!~
