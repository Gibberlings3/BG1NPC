    with Dynaheir, with Minsc, with Edwin, or alone.&nbsp; Drizzt initiates a
    new path after (if ) you help him defeat the Gnolls in his area. This may
    start immediately, if Dynaheir is in your party, or if she is not then return
    to the area with her to start the quest.</p>
  <p> <a href="#spoiler_1" name="spoiler_1" id="spoiler_1" class="spoiler">All

    <a href="#spoiler_4" name="spoiler_4" id="spoiler_4"  class="spoiler">Drizzt
    has Left The Building. Party will encounter &quot;Good Gnolls&quot;, then &quot;Evil
    Gnolls&quot;. And kill the evil ones, of course.<br /></a></p>
  <p> If you are on the &quot;Drizzt Alone&quot; path,<a href="#spoiler_6" name="spoiler_6" id="spoiler_6"  class="spoiler"> you
      are done. A day later, Drizzt seeks out the party (in
any southwestern outdoor area EXCEPT the original area FW4200, and lets them know that
      he had to kill a group of evil Gnolls to get it.</a></p>
  <p> If you are on the Party-Searches with Drizzt, <a href="#spoiler_7" name="spoiler_7" id="spoiler_7"  class="spoiler">you
      are done; Drizzt will find you and deliver the journal.</a> </p>
  <p> If you are a Party-Alone scenario, <a href="#spoiler_8" name="spoiler_8" id="spoiler_8"  class="spoiler">almost
      immediately after the Good Gnoll Encounter the Evil Gnolls spawn, yell
      about attacking, and initiate combat. Killing them results in treasure,
      including the journal; Dynaheir should talk about it immediately on picking
      it up. At this point, if Edwin is in the party, there is a branch to an
      Ed/Dy verbal conflict; if you froce Dy to let Ed see the journal, he has
      to return it after a day. If you don't, he steals it after a day and has
      to return it.</a></p>
  <p> End of story <a href="#spoiler_9" name="spoiler_9" id="spoiler_9" class="spoiler">until
      the Maze into the UnderCity,</a> unless/until you are in romance.</p>
  <p> <a href="#spoiler_10" name="spoiler_10" id="spoiler_10" class="spoiler">If
      you hit Dy romance active 2 after getting the journal, three days or so
      later Winski shows up to try to clobber/abduct Dy +/- Minsc. He either
      succedes, and the party members disappear with him, or he teleports away
      leaving a bunch of summoned imps (variable by # in party) and a special
      imp who chants a Domi-original spell, complete with sound effects and all
      the bells and whistles. If the party kills the imp, great - move on. If
      they don't kill it before the spell is completed, then Dy +/- Minsc are
      teleported away.</a></p>
  <p> Final encounter; regardless of romance, <a href="#spoiler_11" name="spoiler_11" id="spoiler_11" class="spoiler">if
      Dynaheir is in the party in the Maze when you encounter Winski's dying
      body, there is a story-fleshing-out/closure discusion between Dy and Winski.</a> </p>
