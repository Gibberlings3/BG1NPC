@107  = ~When the New World of Maztica was discovered, Duke Eltan of the Flaming Fist was among those intrigued by it. Like all males, he had stupid dreams. He thought he would succeed where Balduran failed, in his fool's quest to reach Anchorome. Eltan gathered together a fleet and sent the Flaming Fist west. Some sailed to Chult, and others sought Anchorome itself. With male leadership, the expedition was a disaster.~
@108  = ~Disease, fierce storms, rampaging Sahuagin, savage Elven warriors, attacks by whale-like beasts on the ships - you name it. Of the more than five hundred mercenaries who had sought out Anchorome, less than a hundred remained to flee Elven territories and establish a besieged settlement at Fort Flame. Among their number was a Commander who distinguished himself in battle against the Sahuagin, a man by the name of Scar. My father was a little known private.~
@109  = ~By the time the expedition had reached the site of Fort Flame, he had personally slain a Sahuagin and three Elves. When the initial Elven surprise attack had fallen like a hammer on the already weary remnants of the Flaming Fist expedition, my father had been one of the few to hold to his position, while many of the other pathetic Flaming Fist soldiers broke and fled. In the end, his position held, a counterattack routed the Elves, and all who had manned their posts became heroes. Commander Scar himself led the counterattack, and took down the names of the defenders for later commendation.~
@110  = ~When some of the expedition's survivors returned to Baldur's Gate, Angelo and Scar were among them. They were greeted as heroes, and Angelo was hailed as a respected war hero and promoted to lieutenant.~

@116  = ~Because it's all a lie. He is for sale to anyone with enough money to buy his loyalty.

@130  = ~He is the most despised thing among thieves - a Fist for sale.~
@131  = ~I hate him, because he doesn't consider women worthy of being anything more than a man's bed-warmer and a kitchen slave! I spent all my childhood serving my father and brothers, because I'm female! My brothers are his pride and joy, and I... he *laughed* when he saw me training with the sword. He did not beat me... he just laughed and told me to stop fooling with men's things and pick up a broom, instead.~

@133  = ~I take it Ysena was some sort of mentor to you.~
@134  = ~Ysena... Who was Ysena?~
@135  = ~Oh, well. I have heard enough for one <DAYNIGHT>. Let's keep moving.~
@136  = ~Well, maybe he was not that far off the mark. Of course, he was rude about expressing the idea, but wouldn't you be happier nicely dressed and married to a likely lad than plodding through the wilderness in heavy armor, doing a butcher's job...~

@142  = ~No, Shar-Teel, I truly think that one day the right man will come into your life, and your attitude will change. I even hope that it has already happened...~
@143  = ~*shake yourself* They must have. Remind me to go kill more of them, one of these days. In revenge... and I enjoy watching their death throes.~
@144  = ~I was just kidding, Shar. Don't you have a sense of humor?~
@145  = ~Eewww... stay away from me, gooey one.~
@146  = ~That's better.~

@170  = ~So I followed her. When the woman noticed she was being tailed, she hid to see who was following her. When she saw that it was I again, she became enraged. She leapt out of the shadows and wrapped her fingers around my neck, lifting me in the air with one hand.~

@235  = ~My *wailing?* I am a very good bard, I will have you know! One of the best in the West, for that matter.~
@236  = ~Very well. I do not know where I was born, or to whom. My own memory starts abruptly in my early years. It's as if somebody tore the first few pages from a book~
@237  = ~Very well. I only now have uncovered that Bhaal had sired me. I neither know where I was born, nor who my mother was. As Gorion wrote, she died giving birth to me. My own memory starts abruptly in my early years. It's as if somebody tore the first few pages from a book.~

@242  = ~You gangrenous mongrel! *swings her gauntleted hand at you*~
@243  = ~Hush, Shar-Teel. People tell personal stuff like that when they feel like it, and you are trying to club it out of me? What's next? Will you try to wrestle my journal away?~
@244  = ~I'll tell you all you need to know, in time.~
@245  = ~Does your anger perhaps indicate that you are more curious about me than you want to show? That perhaps you *gasp* trust me?~

@251  = ~Your sire - now, that was a God to my liking!~
@252  = ~Too bad I have to settle for the son!~
@253  = ~Are you truly his blood, going on like that about *books*?~
@254  = ~Doubt not my blood, flower. It sings in me. But that's the only way I'll tell the story. Do you still want to hear or not?~
@255  = ~Yes, I was conceived from the Lord of Murder's seed, but I was weaned in a library, she-bear. It's natural that I slip to books and chapters when I speak of my childhood.~

@261  = ~Your what?! A diary! You keep a diary!~
@262  = ~*For a few moments Shar-Teel laughs so hard she cannot speak.*~

@266  = ~Bah, for all I care, you can stuff your biography where the sun never shines!~
@267  = ~Yeah... RIGHT! *Shar-Teel storms away, but she did not punch you in the face. Probably, for her it's just like blushing for any other woman.*~
@268  = ~Go ahead, but don't call me one of those annoying, smelly things again.~
@269  = ~The way you put it, I am even more inclined to call you my flower, Shar-Teel. The similarity is stunning!~
@270  = ~I was thinking of a different kind of flower. The spiny, hardy ones that they say grow in the deserts. They survive the harshest temperatures, the sandstorms and droughts. Even through such adversity, they still manage to bloom. Their blossoms are much prettier than your garden variety daises.~

@294  = ~Alright, she-bear.~
@295  = ~Can that be care that I hear in your voice?~
@296  = ~Ha! Right you are. Shall we mingle our bloods?~
@297  = ~*take her by her chin* No, I have other designs for you than making you my blood sister. The custom frowns on bedding one.~
@298  = ~I... I will view such a vow as the highest honor, Shar-Teel.~
@299  = ~I can live without it.~
@300  = ~How marvelously dramatic!~
@301  = ~So, you are proud of me? Say, should I slash my wrist now, and so we can mingle our bloods?~
@302  = ~*Take her by her chin* No, I have other designs for you than making you my blood sister. The custom frowns on bedding one.~
@303  = ~Well, at least you can back up your mouth with your muscle.~
@304  = ~*Shar-Teel takes the punch stoically without blocking.* I'm glad you aren't a weakling that is afraid to pick a fight with a woman. *She wipes her bleeding nose and snorts.* More of that red sticky stuff... so, shall we mingle our bloods?~

@309  = ~I do not know. A man's curiosity, perhaps.~
@310  = ~Curse my big mouth!~
@311  = ~Are you going to hit me or something, if I answer this question?~
@312  = ~And who said you're going t'bed me?~
@313  = ~Your eyes did.~
@314  = ~No one. I just... hoped... you might want to.~
@315  = ~I did.~
@316  = ~But you know the price of that honor, lover-boy? I would never sleep with my blood brother.~
@317  = ~Wait, wait! I have changed my mind, Shar-Teel.~
@318  = ~That's fine. My respect for you far exceeds my carnal desires.~
@319  = ~Let me put it this way, Shar-Teel. I can take any woman I wish when we pass through the next village. Some will come willingly, some will need persuasion, but none of them can give me more than that. You can.~
@320  = ~Fool! Pathetic male fool!~
@321  = ~So you are afraid of me? That's good. Men, like dogs, should know their place.~
@322  = ~I would have plucked out these traitors, but I need them to fight! Maybe I should poke yours out, so they could not see-~
@323  = ~But they are... beautiful, your eyes.~

@325  = ~Ha! Keep hoping. Hopes adorn a man.~
@326  = ~Never listen to liars, <CHARNAME>.~

@328  = ~Well, mayhap you are prepared to give up your carnal desires, but I am not.~
@329  = ~And you want me to be standing by watching, while you are jumping whores? I think not!~
@330  = ~That Gorion you keep talking about, was he good to you?~

@332  = ~He was very kind to me, yes.~
@333  = ~*shrug* He fed me, clothed me and made sure I memorized lots of useless lore. Would you call that 'being good' to someone?~
@334  = ~Then it's past time you do. I told you of my father.~
@335  = ~You told me how much you hate your father, and you expect me to tell you how much I hated Gorion. But since I loved Gorion, I prefer not to talk about it to you.~
@336  = ~*sigh* Very well. He fed me, clothed me and made sure I memorized lots of useless lore. Would you call that 'being good' to someone?~
@337  = ~Shar-Teel, if I had a choice between you and a mongrel dog for a confidante, I would go for the owner of a wagging tail.~
@338  = ~Right. Why then do you not have his name? Did he begrudge it to you, because you are a bastard-born?~
@339  = ~Demi-gods need no last names, Shar-Teel. I am <CHARNAME>, and it is sufficient.~
@340  = ~Where did you get this nonsense from? Of course I have Gorion's last name!~
@341  = ~I... I suppose he wanted me to be known under my mother's name.~
@342  = ~Are you happier for being Shar-Teel Dosan, Shar-Teel?~
@343  = ~Because Greymantle does not suit me?~
@344  = ~I do not even *know* what Gorion's last name was. He was called the Grey and Greymantle, and he was also known as Spellweaver, and the Harper's Hand...~
@345  = ~He did better by you than mine father did by me...~
@346  = ~But at least mine gave me his bloody name. Why don't you have Gorion's name? Did he begrudge it to you, because you are a bastard born?~
@347  = ~Yeah, I figured you'd want someone who'd roll over on her back the moment you looked at her. *Shar-Teel spits.* Bah, go find yourself one like that, then.~
@348  = ~Gah, shut up. Gorion this, Gorion that, I have Gorion's last name... I am sick and tired of hearing about your stupid Gorion!~
@349  = ~More like he did not give a shit what a bastard's ass calls himself. It's so like men...~
@350  = ~I use that name to spite my father, so he can choke on my 'fame'! I will shout it for the crowds to loathe on my way to gallows.~
@351  = ~*She snorts.* It sure does not fit you.~
@352  = ~And you are what, weighing my name against Dosan, in case we get married?~
@353  = ~What's in my name for you, she-bear?~
@354  = ~I am glad we agree on something...~
@355  = ~Whatever.~
@356  = ~That's pathetic. I like dwarven names. Battlerager, Stoutshield, Bloodaxe - those are good names!~
@357  = ~Then ye should be thrilled that I did not take Gorion's.~
@358  = ~You're what, picking a man with a decent name to marry, so that you can be rid of Dosan?~
@359  = ~Ye gods! I would not marry in the first place, and in the second, even if I did under the spell of feeble-mindedness, no doubt, I would never change my name. I have too much fun using it to *spite* my father. He chokes on my 'fame'! I would shout it for the crowds to loathe on my way to gallows.~
@360  = ~Exactly the same as in the rest of you... NOTHING!~
@361  = ~I grow tired of travelling with you.~
@362  = ~Why is that, Shar-Teel?~
@363  = ~Then get lost. Just don't whine.~
@364  = ~Well, that's too bad. You are my sworn sword, so tough it out.~
@365  = ~I don't know. Blood pours freely around you, and there is plenty of loot.~
@366  = ~It's just... something gnaws at me. Something...~
@367  = ~Once you know what it is, do tell me, Shar-Teel. I treasure you too much to let stupid things drive you away.~
@368  = ~You must have eaten something at that last inn we stopped. I told you that it smelled funny. Well, by the morrow it'll either kill you or make you stronger. Either way, there is nothing to worry about.~
@369  = ~Something? That's rather... vague.~
@370  = ~As far as I am concerned, you can get lost any time you want. Just don't whine.~
@371  = ~Whine? WHINE? You rotten bag of pig entrails!~
@372  = ~I don't want to *tough it out*, you creep!~
@373  = ~I knew it would come to that! Women are just not cut out to be fighters. They get their days, and immediately swords are too heavy, chain mail makes them look fat and something... *SOMETHING* is bothering them... *you spit* Something!~
@374  = ~I am sorry, I can see now that it really bothers you. Once you know what it is, do tell me, Shar-Teel. I treasure you too much to let stupid things drive you away.~
@375  = ~Here! Here it is again, that weird feeling in my stomach! As if someone hit my solar plexus with a club and knocked the wind out of my lungs...~
@376  = ~Your stomach? Well, that explains it! You must have eaten something at that last inn we stopped. I told you that it smelled funny. Well, by the morrow it'll either kill you or make you stronger. Either way, there is nothing to worry about.~
@377  = ~*You hide a smile.* It... it will get better with time. I promise you, Shar-Teel. Just... trust me on that one, alright?~
@378  = ~Hmm... does it, by any chance, coincide with you looking at me or touching me or hearing my voice?~
@379  = ~*She frowns.* It did not look all that bad, and I was hungry, dammit!~
@380  = ~Well, it's a weird feeling in my stomach. As if someone hit me into my solar plexus with a club and knocked the wind out of my lungs... yet, nobody did.~
@381  = ~Hey, bugger off! I am bloody tougher than anyone in this stupid party, and I can prove it any time. So just leave me alone.~
@382  = ~*To your surprise, Shar-Teel puts her palm on your forearm and squeezes...gently.* Alright.~
@383  = ~Yeah... that's right. *Shar-Teel cocks her head to one shoulder and looks at you with disgust.* Who would have thought that you are revolting enough to move a woman to vomiting?~
@384  = ~I'm used to brainless males, but from our time together, I know that you're better than many. I wouldn't be able to stand your presence otherwise.~
@385  = ~Your apology is accepted.~
@386  = ~What I want is for you to show some respect, not an apology.~
@387  = ~Well, I can't stand you at all. Begone, preferably into a wyvern's jaws.~
@388  = ~Gee, thanks. Now shut up.~
@389  = ~Well, you've just proved me wrong for the last time. Gods, you'd think I'd have learned my lesson by now! All men are scum!~
@390  = ~What makes you think I'm apologizing?! Apologies are for slavering dogs. I won't be apologizing for my words or my actions, so don't hold your breath waiting for it. By the looks of you, you'd die far too quickly, and where's the fun in that?~
@391  = ~That's it. Now you die.~
@392  = ~Some would say that willingness to apologize directly corresponds to strength of character.~
@393  = ~You're right, apologies ARE for dogs. So don't expect me to be saying 'sorry' for the punch you're about to receive.~
@394  = ~Yes, apologies are for the weak. I am glad we are agreed.~
@395  = ~Then those 'some' are the weaklings... or fools.~
@396  = ~The only fool is you, Shar-Teel. You may possess strength of body, but your character is severely lacking.~
@397  = ~And why is it so foolish to think this way? There is nobility in this thought - something I'm sure that the warrior in you can appreciate.~
@398  = ~You do have a point.~
@399  = ~Really? No, I think *you'll* be dying today.~
@400  = ~And where has strength of character ever gotten anyone?! I don't care for judgments, especially from a dog such as yourself. Get lost.~
@401  = ~Not just yet. Why is it so foolish to think this way? There is nobility in this thought - something I'm sure the warrior in you can appreciate.~
@402  = ~Have it your way.~
@403  = ~Then I have no quarrel with you. Ha! Your squeaks of agreement would be amusing if they weren't so pathetic.~
@404  = ~Nobility itself is foolish. Look at the - pfeh! - 'knights' of the city, rotting in their armor as they stand like slabs of meat, doing nothing, killing nothing. Chivalry won't lead to power. The strong know this. You should, too.~
@405  = ~I do know this, Shar-Teel. I was trying to get a new idea into that skull of yours.~
@406  = ~Then we will remain at odds on this point. I care more for strength of mind than strength of body. Your bodily strength will fail you one day... your mind will not.~
@407  = ~You're right. Apologies ARE for the weak... why did I not see it before?~
@408  = ~Well, when I want my mind filled with idiotic ideas about nobility, then I'll come to you.~
@409  = ~We'll see you when you're old and imbecilic, bowing to those who know where power lies.~
@410  = ~*Shar-Teel whistles* <CHARNAME>! Come here!~
@411  = ~*You ignore her.*~
@412  = ~*You cringe.* I wish you'd stop doing it, Shar-Teel.~
@413  = ~Yes, Shar-Teel?~
@414  = ~*Without saying a word, you come up to Shar-Teel, wrap your arms around her shoulders and kiss her neck.*~
@415  = ~I said 'COME HERE'!~
@416  = ~No, you did not. You've whistled. I am not a mongrel dog.~
@417  = ~*You continue to ignore her.*~
@418  = ~Listen to me, Shar-Teel, and listen carefully. I want you to be with me, but I will not be diminished to a dog's or a slave's state for the sake of keeping you in my bedroll.~
@419  = ~*She leans her head backward and barks out laughter.*~
@420  = ~Shut up, wench.~
@421  = ~You have quite a sense of humor, she-bear. Perhaps you can explain the joke, and we will laugh together? Or *wink* make smiles?~
@422  = ~*in a cranky mocking voice* Yieees, Shar-teel?~
@423  = ~What are you, a dog? It was fun to hear you ask 'how high?' when I said 'jump!', but I am sick of it.~
@424  = ~You are weaker than most men. *spits* Men, phew! You are weaker than a floor rug!~
@425  = ~*cringes in disgust* Yes, that's what I mean. Too bad you aren't a tiefling, or you'd be wiggling your tail.~
@426  = ~It was fun to hear you ask 'how high?' when I said 'jump!', but I am sick of it.~
@427  = ~*She starts struggling.* What the hell are you doing, you, baseborn son of a strumpet?~
@428  = ~*quietly you let go of her* I was kissing you, she-bear. A vile thing to do to someone you consider attractive, of course. Good thing you can take care of yourself! Foul man that I am, I was about to give you even rougher treatment. Like unlacing that leather vest and tormenting those pink hard buds that I remember seeing underneath.~
@429  = ~*She gives you a crooked smile.* Why, that's quite some news. The way you've been acting lately, I thought you were my dog.~
@430  = ~Woof-woof!~
@431  = ~*quietly* I was trying to get to know you, she-bear. To understand you... people do it when they do not wish to belittle or exploit their... their beloved.~
@432  = ~Bah! Seems you do have some spine, after all.~
@433  = ~What, you don't like my jokes? Bah! At least you do have enough zest to fight back. Some male weaklings consider it beneath them.~
@434  = ~Do you do it on purpose?! Speak in these long, crooked sentences, and your voice is all... all... you know, like you are saying something very profound? And your eyes look into mine. I feel like you are a snake trying to crawl into my breeches... under my very skin!~
@435  = ~Shh... calm down. There are no snakes here. It's just how I always speak.~
@436  = ~*Shar-Teel slowly expels air.* Now that's... that's the best thing you have said all week. *She takes you into a tight hug.* You know, you can do that... that vile thing...~
@437  = ~*If you did not know that it was Shar-Teel you were looking at, you could have said that her smile was shy.*~
@438  = ~And bugger the rest of the world!~
@439  = ~*No, it could not have possibly been shyness...*~
@440  = ~You... you... SHUT THE BLOODY NINE HELLS UP!~
@441  = ~Explain the joke to you? I'll put it simple-like: you are a joke. Beats me why I am still with you.~
@442  = ~Mmgh... that was GOOD!~
@443  = ~Now, let's go bash some heads! My blood has never run so high!~
@444  = ~How I hate all these commoners, farmers, merchants and the like scum!~
@445  = ~And why do you hate them, she-bear?~
@446  = ~And why do you hate them, pumpkin?~
@447  = ~*sigh* The list of those you like... nay, I should have said 'those you do not hate with passion' grows thin. Out of purely scientific interest: does it include anyone but Ysena and yourself?~
@448  = ~Do you... do you like yourself, Shar-Teel?~
@449  = ~Because they live those miserable lives, obeying petty ugly lords, lying, stealing and murdering no less than bandits, but call it all 'honest living' and feel morally superior to us. They are all so full of it, that I wish I could just kill them all.~
@450  = ~Wow, Shar-Teel, you are surely exaggerating. They are pathetic, of course, and more boring than Gorion's lectures, but stealing and murdering? They have no guts for that.~
@451  = ~I think we are doing a pretty good job of it as it is, Shar-Teel. Don't you think?~
@452  = ~*You chuckle.* With your bloodlust and cravings you would made a fearsome vampire, she-bear.~
@453  = ~As well you'd be killing sheep. Just as boring.~
@454  = ~Much as I share your disdain for the commoners, I will not risk my standing in the society's eyes. Power, Shar-Teel, is what gives you the ability to kill and be praised for it. In fact, I'd measure a person's power by the number he could order killed. If nobody dares count, then you're a god.~
@455  = ~Because they say things like 'pumpkin' to those they bed. Now bugger off.~
@456  = ~I like you.~
@457  = ~*You cough.* What?~
@458  = ~Shar-Teel... please, do not get angry, but... do you like yourself?~
@459  = ~And what I am to do with your 'liking'? Shove, it girl. We have no time for it.~
@460  = ~That's good to know, she-bear. Now, tell me, why do you hate commoners?~
@461  = ~They have no guts to do it openly, like you or I would do. But they do it in their stealthy, creepy ways. *She spits.* Stinkers.~
@462  = ~I think we are doing a pretty good job of killing them, Shar-Teel. Don't you think?~
@463  = ~Alright, I agree. But killing them? As well you'd be killing sheep. Boring.~
@464  = ~Much as I share your disdain for the commoners, I will not risk my standing in the society's eyes by going on a mass-murdering spree. Power, Shar-Teel, is what gives you the ability to kill and be praised for it. In fact, I'd measure a person's power by the number he could order killed. If nobody dares count, then you're a god.~
@465  = ~Yeah... now that I think about it, yeah, pretty good job. Gods, I love bloodshed!~
@466  = ~Well, let's get on with it then, shall we?~
@467  = ~*She snarls.* If I were a vampire, I'd choke on their thin blood! Besides, I love life too much... well, when I feel alive, that is. You know, when blood rushes to my head at the sight of our foes, when my blade cuts asunder everyone who opposes me, even when my muscles ache in the mornings after a good fight.~
@468  = ~Well, let's go do some living, then.~
@469  = ~Aye, I understand. Though as of late, there is one more thing that makes me feel alive, apart from battles.~
@470  = ~No, not like sheep. Sheep are too stupid to understand that they deserve to die on your sword.~
@471  = ~Commoners... commoners do understand. They beg you for mercy and say that it is unfair... but they know that it's a lie. In the end, they all see the truth - they are the weak ones to be weeded out. That's why they cry. That's why their sobs and wailing do not irritate me the way the bleating of sheep does.~
@472  = ~I see what you are saying. If only one could take power with her sword alone... but it's the whispers and lies that you need to endure to come into power that I cannot stand. There should be a place somewhere where the strength of the sword hand is your mandate to power. Like in a wolf's pack.~
@473  = ~I said: I LIKE YOU.~
@474  = ~I like you too, Shar-Teel.~
@475  = ~What kind of a stupid question is that? I am strong, and I let no man or woman bullshit me. Of course I like myself.~
@476  = ~The Bloody Nine Hells! *You notice a thin trickle of red that makes its way from the corner of her mouth down to her chin. She must have bitten hard on her tongue.*~
@477  = ~What thing?~
@478  = ~It does not matter. Let us go.~
@479  = ~*slowly, pausing after each word* Your hot, sweaty, trembling...~
@480  = ~*snorts* I got the picture, lover-boy. Yes, that's pretty good too.~
@481  = ~What are you staring at me for? Get under the blankets!~
@482  = ~Yes, ma'am!~
@483  = ~You will have to move the coverlet aside for me to get into the bedroll...~
@484  = ~I am not in the mood for that, Shar-Teel.~
@485  = ~Wait, wait. I am curious, why you were looking at me like this, before I called?~
@486  = ~You see, Shar-Teel, we are always doing it in the dark, or under the blankets... I never really had a chance to take a good look at you. I was wondering if you'd like to let me see all of you.~
@487  = ~I was just staring into the space, Shar-Teel. It comes over me sometimes.~
@488  = ~Oh, yeah... what? Why are you staring at me that way?~
@489  = ~You see, Shar-Teel, we are always doing it in the dark, or under the blankets... I never really had a chance to take a good look at you. Will you permit it?~
@490  = ~Come here, she-bear, I'll show you what I was staring at, and a couple of other things besides.~
@491  = ~Then be damned.~
@492  = ~I might, but favor for favor, lover-boy. You'd do the same, and you go first.~
@493  = ~It's a deal...~
@494  = ~Nay, I've changed my mind.~
@495  = ~But I was the first one to ask!~
@496  = ~Yes, I've noticed that, lover-boy. *She laughs throatily.* But you are in luck tonight. I am willing to overlook your stupidity.~
@497  = ~Well, thanks!~
@498  = ~*snort* Lucked out, did I? You know what? I am not in the mood.~
@499  = ~Good, less innuendo, then.~
@500  = ~Life is not fair, is it?.~
@501  = ~Ah, have it your way...~
@502  = ~Ah, have it your way...~
@503  = ~Right. *You lick your lips.* I... I've changed my mind.~
@504  = ~Ha! You are not as scrawny as I thought, lover-boy...~
@505  = ~Neither are you... come here, she-bear.~
@506  = ~Why do you always aim to offend, Shar-Teel?~
@507  = ~Not that bad, eh?~
@508  = ~I wish I could share the carefully hidden pleasure that I hear in your voice and see in your eyes. You look just plain ugly.~
@509  = ~Oh, let's not start this now!~
@510  = ~Not bad at all...~
@511  = ~Then go find yourself some pretty whore! *Shar-Teel grabs her clothes and rushes past you. She makes a point of pushing you out of her way with all her strength, so you land on your bottom... it will take a lot to mend this, if it can be mended at all.*~
@512  = ~Then go find yourself some pretty whore! *Shar-Teel grabs her clothes and rushes past you. She makes a point of pushing you out of her way with all her strength, so you land on your bottom...*~
@513  = ~...and you are a swine. An ugly, smelly, squealing swine.~
@514  = ~Ha! You are just as scrawny as I thought you would be, lover-boy...~
@515  = ~That makes two of us... come here, she-bear.~
@516  = ~But not *that* bad, eh?~
@517  = ~I wish I could share the carefully hidden pleasure that I hear in your voice and see in your eyes. You look plain ugly.~
@518  = ~Ha! Oh, my! Now I can see why you dived into the blankets so quickly. Just look at these skinny legs, the sunken chest, and the stick-thin arms... any slug and most jellyfish are more muscular than you! *She shudders.* How did I come to share my bed with you?~
@519  = ~That's funny... coming from a behemoth of a woman. I should be the one to shudder. Your neck is as thick as my thigh; your arms are knobbier than stumps and just as rough. One would have to summon the entire City Watch to find your waistline. And, dear, a woman, a real woman is supposed to have two brows, not one prickly caterpillar! You are definitely the most ugly wench I have slept with. *sigh* But one can't be too choosy in the field.~
@520  = ~You know, Shar-Teel, I look at you, and I think that your calves and shoulders are bulging with muscle, and that your hair is cropped too short, and that your body is all covered in scars... but...~
@521  = ~*with as much dignity as you can muster* I think I am going to sleep now. ALONE.~
@522  = ~But?~
@523  = ~But in the night all cats are grey.~
@524  = ~But I like it - the scars, the calves, the prickly hair - because it's you.~
@525  = ~Oh... well. All men are weaklings and you know a thing or two about dancing between the sheets... so... *She nuzzles your neck almost tenderly.*~
@526  = ~*With as much dignity as you can muster* I think I am going to sleep now. ALONE.~
@527  = ~*You take Shar-Teel in your embrace and kiss her forehead.* So let us dance...~
@528  = ~I noticed that you handle me like a rotten egg: with extreme caution and disgust. Don't you dare to deny it!~
@529  = ~Alright, I won't deny it.~
@530  = ~I will not deny you anything, Shar-Teel. I think... I think there have been enough people who did, starting with your own father. Yet, disgust is hardly a word I would use to describe what I feel toward you.~
@531  = ~*You cringe.* Language, Shar-Teel, language! Why you persist in using the most bizarre and obnoxious expressions is beyond me.~
@532  = ~*You try to sound tough.* Cut it out, you crazy witch of a woman. I've done nothing of the sort.~
@533  = ~How could one claim to know all there is to know about men, be so cynical and yet remain... so clueless?~
@534  = ~Well, look at me the wrong way another time, and I will beat you to pulp.~
@535  = ~*She snorts.* And that would be, lover-boy? Speak plainly!~
@536  = ~Why, 'love', of course.~
@537  = ~I love you, Shar-Teel.~
@538  = ~I care about you. You do not make it easy, she-bear, but I do care.~
@539  = ~What sprang to my mind just now is: "Wipe your nose."~
@540  = ~*stifling a yawn* You are a great fighter. I respect you for that.~
@541  = ~We had a conversation like that already, remember? My opinion of you has not changed. You are a comrade at arms whom I value.~
@542  = ~*She snorts.* And which words would you use, lover-boy?~
@543  = ~Why, 'love', of course.~
@544  = ~I have come to care about you. You do not make it easy, she-bear, but I do care.~
@545  = ~In your case, I prefer to communicate without words, Shar-Teel. If you were any other woman I would have said... ah, forget it.~
@546  = ~So you did! Even now you sound... false. You look like a thief who is trying to disarm a trap!~
@547  = ~*You lie.* I assure you that you are mistaken.~
@548  = ~*You tell the truth* I assure you that you are mistaken. There is no double meaning in my words, and I treat you like I have always treated you... nothing has changed.~
@549  = ~That is because you are a trap. Every time I try to be sincere or kind with you, you slap me back. I have to guard my words to avoid fighting with you.~
@550  = ~I will not let you to snare me into a senseless argument. You talk, talk, talk... always talk. You are like... a spider who sets poisonous webs to catch me.~
@551  = ~You know, I grow tired of this. I won't speak to you again.~
@552  = ~Stupid girl. You would not know semantics if it danced a tarantella on your nose and shouted: "Hey! Look at me, I'm Semantics!" ~
@553  = ~I am sorry, Shar-Teel, I was just trying to... to befriend you. I have come to care about you. You do not make it easy, she-bear, but I do care.~
@554  = ~*You breath in, as if preparing to dive.* I love you, Shar-Teel, that's why I try to talk to you. I did not mean to poison you or any such thing.~
@555  = ~Well, next time I wish to attract your attention, I will simply charge at you wielding the biggest club I can find. Is that what you want?~
@556  = ~Well, I can't help you any with that. I'm not a lying bitch who pretends to be tougher than nails, but secretly wishes for a man to come and save her from her 'plight'. Love me all you want, I just need a lively man in my bed to spice up the adventuring. Don't try to 'reform' me, and we both get what we want out of each other.~
@557  = ~Then you feel just like I do. *She spits.* The Nine Hells, that must be the most idiotic conversation I've had in my whole life.~
@558  = ~But I'm not any other woman. Say what you wish, or shut your trap.~
@559  = ~*You remain silent.*~
@560  = ~*She bursts out into a hoarse laughter.* You are something, aren't you?~
@561  = ~*She shrugs.* Of course I am. Now shut your trap, and let's go kill someone already. The coins won't jump into our pockets on their own, you know.~
@562  = ~Good. Don't think that I will lose my wits because I bed you. I'm not a lying bitch who pretends to be tougher than nails, but secretly wishes for a man to come and save her from her 'plight'. I do need a lively man in my bed once in a while to spice up the adventuring, and you suit me just fine. Don't try to 'reform' me, and we both get what we want out of each other.~
@563  = ~*She cringes.* Ye gods, I was bedding a coward. Ewww...~
@564  = ~Good, a man should not speak unless spoken to.~
@565  = ~That could be fun, yes. But a sword, if you could handle it properly, is better. Jokes aside, though...~
@566  = ~Don't think that I will lose my wits because I bed you. I'm not a lying bitch who pretends to be tougher than nails, but secretly wishes for a man to come and save her from her 'plight'. I do need a lively man in my bed once in a while to spice up the adventuring, and you suit me just fine. Don't try to 'reform' me, and we both get what we want out of each other.~
@567  = ~Listen, I never told the whole of it to anyone, except Ysena. But I suppose I can trust you.~
@568  = ~I told you how I became Ysena's pupil, but don't think she was the sort who coddles her apprentices like infants. She used me to do what needed to be done. Ysena always said that if I died, it would only be my own fault. 'You can never rely on others to take care of you or to save you. It's tough to be on your own, Shar-Teel, but anything else will put you on a leash eventually.' ~
@569  = ~Shar-Teel, can I ask you just one question? Why did you risk your independence and trade the life of a sworn sword for a mere twenty gold pieces?~
@570  = ~Wise advice. Go on.~
@571  = ~I was hungry, and you were too many to kill. That duel crap always worked for me in the past.~
@572  = ~But it has nothing to do with what I was going to tell you...~
@573  = ~Once, I was sent to deliver a message to one of Ysena's contacts... the head of a local bandit gang loosely associated with Chill. I made the rendezvous with the taskmaster as instructed, but some worm betrayed our location to the Fist, and we were attacked. Those of us who survived the ambush were marched to a nearby tree. They barked some legal tripe, waved a document in our faces, then set about hanging us. One of the Fist threw a noose around my neck, but when he caught sight of my face, he turned and shouted to his company - 'Look here, this water rat is a girl!' The Captain waved for them to cut me down and said all quiet like: 'There's a better way to teach her a lesson.' Then he gave me over to his soldiers... to do with as they pleased.~
@574  = ~I was hurting inside out when they were through with me, since it pleased some of them to soften me up with their fists and boots before having their go. The Captain then commanded them to leave me where I lay. But before he left, the bastard pulled his horse alongside me and dismounted. He lifted my head off the ground by the hair, cringing at the blood and dirt that stained his glove. Then he whispered into my ear: "You should consider yourself lucky, little girl... I'm setting you free. I trust that you've learned your lesson and won't entangle yourself with such scum again. Remember," he said, "bad things happen to vile people."~
@575  = ~I was so weak that I could barely breath, though I burned to follow after and kill the whole wretched lot of them. When I could move again, I crawled back to Ysena.~
@576  = ~"You'll live," she said briskly. Then she asked: "Since you have returned, I assume that you indeed learned your lesson." And when I nodded she said she'd hear what I've learned.~
@577  = ~And I told her, just as I'll tell you now: There is nothing- no pain, no humiliation, no threat, fear, or obligation- nothing... that can keep a strong person from doing what she wants.~
@578  = ~*gulp* O... okay.~
@579  = ~That's the feel-good story of the year!~
@580  = ~Why did you tell that to me, Shar-Teel?~
@581  = ~*You hit your palm with your fist.* If I ever run into this Captain...~
@582  = ~Hmm... I thought you've had a stronger stomach than that.~
@583  = ~*She shrugs.* If you say so.~
@584  = ~I told that old story to you, because I've noticed how you allow all sorts of stupid things to influence you. Gorion, dreams, mercy, honor - all that nonsense.~
@585  = ~How in the Hells would you know what influences me?!~
@586  = ~I see. You disapprove of others pressuring me into things, and so you decide to influence me in turn. I must say, Shar-Teel, you are acting very... womanly.~
@587  = ~I... I would hardly call it nonsense, Shar-Teel. Our actions affect so many people, and I'd rather they not suffer because of me.~
@588  = ~You are babbling, wench.~
@589  = ~Eww! I've done no such thing!~
@590  = ~He is mine, <CHARNAME>. I don't need some idiotic knight in shiny armor to pay back my debts. And I'll beat you bloody if you start acting like one!~
@591  = ~*She snorts.* Call it a gut feeling, lover-boy. I think you've mellowed since we first met, and I'm not at all impressed.~
@592  = ~I see. So you think that certain... people or ideas pressure me into doing things differently, and so you decide to influence me in turn. I must say, Shar-Teel, you are acting very... womanly.~
@593  = ~Like it or not, I am changing. Our actions affect so many people, and I'd rather they not suffer because of me.~
@594  = ~Listen, you are the last person I would like to have a philosophical debate with. Just know this - I always act having my best interests at heart and follow naught but my own desires. Right now I require the freedom to move around without the Fist harassing me at every turn.~
@595  = ~I gave you an honest piece of my mind - so yes, I suppose I am acting like a woman. You pathetic dolt! Now quit whining like some mongrel dog with your tail caught in a door, and march on. You do better with your mouth shut.~
@596  = ~They suffer, because they are weak. They deserved it. But you - you lower yourself to their level, when you start considering their worthless hurts.~
@597  = ~So, Shar-Teel, you deserved to be raped by the Fist then?~
@598  = ~Ye gods... You are right. I am wrong. Let us go.~
@599  = ~There is a certain something in your words, Shar-Teel. I will have to think on that.~
@600  = ~Pathetic boor... and a blind one to boot.~
@601  = ~Listen to yourself! You are bleating like some... man! All your 'designs' boil down to finding one person or another around the Coast and killing him. And to keep doing *that* unobstructed you are afraid of warming your hands with Fist blood? How pathetic is this?~
@602  = ~No. And I will prove it by gutting each and every one of these men.~
@603  = ~You know what... I'd actually care if you died, and that's more than I can say for any other person. Thought I'd tell you, you seem to like that sort of stuff.~
@604  = ~I am flattered, Shar-Teel.~
@605  = ~Shit. Now I feel obliged to waste money on resurrection if your body hits the floor.~
@606  = ~Should I delight in it or be scared, she-bear?~
@607  = ~If I did die, Shar-Teel, what would you do?~
@608  = ~Whatever jerk downs you - I'd make him choke on his own guts, that's what I'd do.~
@609  = ~Why are you so sure it would be a man to kill me?~
@610  = ~Perhaps it would be a woman, as beautiful as she is perilous, who should first seduce me and then drain my life drop by drop... That's how I always wanted to die. But not before I've reached good and ripe age, mind you.~
@611  = ~Hmm, I am glad that I don't have to worry about you being bored stiff in mourning for me.~
@612  = ~Nah, it ain't worth it. Just make sure that you get whoever did it, so I could meet him on the other side and prove that it was a simple turn of luck that he beat me.~
@613  = ~Shar-Teel, Shar-Teel. The afterlife is so complex, you might never meet your adversary, even if I killed him.~
@614  = ~Aye, I sure would.~
@615  = ~I'd capture him and then resurrect you, so you could do it yourself.~
@616  = ~She-bear, there is no other woman like you in all of the Realms. While I live I want you with me.~
@617  = ~*She spits.* Whatever you bloody want.~
@618  = ~One more thing that ought to put a smile on your face.~
@619  = ~What do you mean, what would I do? A!~
@620  = ~'Cause I'd let no other woman come within an arrowshot of you.~
@621  = ~*She pushes you with her elbow and laughs roughly.* Did you buy that, lover-boy?~
@622  = ~You let some bloody bitch seduce you, and we both get what we want - you'd die right there beside her, and I'd get to choke a jerk on his own guts.~
@623  = ~I am never bored, lover-boy, unless the bloodshed stops. And I tell you, lover-boy - that ain't gonna happen in our lifetime, thank Bane.~
@624  = ~Yes, but I want to know that I at least stand a chance. A very good chance, even, since all of us are likely to end up in the Nine Hells regardless.~
@625  = ~Thanks, I'd like to know that I might get a chance to get another stab in even after it's over.~
@626  = ~You are something, lover-boy, aren't you? *Almost shyly, she kisses your cheek.*~
@627  = ~Ah, what the hell! *She grabs your head into her hands and plants a hard and deep kiss onto your lips.*~
@628  = ~Well, you keep going about misty-eyed like that, and your lifespan will be reduced to mere hours.~
@629  = ~Does it amuse you to chase your foster father's murderer?~
@630  = ~This is a strange question, Shar-Teel. What brought it up?~
@631  = ~I feel many things in turn - angry, frustrated, haunted, ambivalent - but never amused. My foster father's death is too important to make light of.~
@632  = ~Yes, sometimes.~
@633  = ~*You shrug.* Pretty much everything amuses me. Life's one funny pot o'honey, she-bear.~
@634  = ~No. I do not feel amused. Should I?~
@635  = ~What's strange about it?~
@636  = ~Your choice of words... Amused. I feel many things by turns - angry, frustrated, haunted, ambivalent - but never amused. My foster father's death is too important to make light of.~
@637  = ~Someone wondering about how I feel is, at the very least, a novel experience.~
@638  = ~Nothing, I guess. No. I do not feel amused. Should I?~
@639  = ~Nothing, I guess. Yes... I do feel amused sometimes.~
@640  = ~Anger is good, but too much anger when you aren't fighting is no good for you. Just think what you'll do to this black-armored bastard, once you get your hands on him, and you'd feel better.~
@641  = ~My imagination fails me, but perhaps you could help me out with that. Well... what should I do with the miscreant?~
@642  = ~If I'm amused, it's at the endlessness of our chase... how the goal always seems so close, yet continues to eludes me. And at how incredibly foolish I am to think that all of this really matters in the great scheme of things.~
@643  = ~I told you already: I will not make light of anything connected with my father's murder, and I will not lower myself to imagining the prizes I've yet to win.~
@644  = ~Only sometimes? What exactly do you find amusing?~
@645  = ~The endlessness of our chase... how the goal always seems so close, yet continues to eludes me. And at how incredibly foolish I am to think that all of this really matters in the great scheme of things.~
@646  = ~That I let myself be dragged into it. I cannot bring myself to care about Gorion's death. I would be just as happily tanning in Calimshan as dodging the petty assassins here, yet somehow I stick with this idiotic game.~
@647  = ~Killing. It's always fun. Nobody dies just like the next man. And, unlike jokes, kills never grow old or repetitive... unless some priestly ass resurrects your former prey, that is. Of course, there are ways to prevent that, too...~
@648  = ~No, it's not! More like a barrel o'blood with a slice of gore on the side, if you ask me.~
@649  = ~But I did not ask you, did I?~
@650  = ~If you wish, she-bear, if you wish.~
@651  = ~My, you are one fine speaker, Shar-Teel.~
@652  = ~Enjoy it, while you can. So, how about answering my question?~
@653  = ~I feel many things by turns - angry, frustrated, haunted, ambivalent - but never amused. My foster father's death is too important to make light of.~
@654  = ~Yeah! Otherwise, why bother? It's so stupid...~
@655  = ~Well, I do not. So, shut up.~
@656  = ~What's stupid? Me, trying to avenge my foster father's murder, is stupid? I'll not have you making light of it!~
@657  = ~I just don't. Sorry if that disappoints you, Shar-Teel.~
@658  = ~Impale him, boil him in oil, burn his innards with acid, quarter him - those are all good, but why chose? Get someone to raise him for you, and try it over and over, until you finally find a satisfactory death for him.~
@659  = ~Wise advice, Shar-Teel.~
@660  = ~I... I think I will leave it to you.~
@661  = ~I'll just slay him in one on one combat, Shar-Teel. It is the honorable thing to do.~
@662  = ~I was going to try a novel approach: make him repent and atone for his crimes...~
@663  = ~By Myrkul, you are such a bore!~
@664  = ~*She snorts.* Well, stubbornness is a common trait of all asses. Being a man, it just comes natural to you.~
@665  = ~Aye, a man after my heart. Speaking of which, what are you going to do with your father's murderer, once we catch him?~
@666  = ~I agree with you, resurrecting him would be a good idea.~
@667  = ~That's because you are a pathetic fool.~
@668  = ~*shoves you on your shoulder roughly* We think alike, lover-boy, that's why you like what I say.~
@669  = ~You look ugly when you pout. Quit sulking and think about something pleasing. How about what we'll do to the murderer of your foster father, once we catch him?~
@670  = ~Yes, that works too... Just make it bloody...~
@671  = ~Eww... I didn't know you were into it. Poke his eyes out, and lop his feet and hands off, before setting him on his road to redemption. That'll bring about the change quicker.~
@672  = ~Sulking, lover-boy?~
@673  = ~What on Toril gave you that impression?~
@674  = ~No, not really, why?~
@675  = ~I think you are sulking yourself, she-bear.~
@676  = ~Kids sulk, adults brood, Shar-Teel.~
@677  = ~I allowed the grim thoughts to overcome me, yes. Do you have a remedy?~
@678  = ~You looked... I don't know. Never mind.~
@679  = ~Shar-Teel?~
@680  = ~How did I look?~
@681  = ~How about we just hit the sack, she-bear?~
@682  = ~I am not sulking! I never sulk. Look at our cooking pot - you cover it too tightly, and the steam just bursts through the seal, throwing your dinner all over the place. It's the same with sulking. I'm not stupid- I vent my anger just fine... in every battle.~
@683  = ~*sigh* Or on me...~
@684  = ~Don't remind me about the cooking pot. <PLAYER2> has no talent for cooking - I dread tonight's stew more than I dread the Iron Throne.~
@685  = ~Fine, fine, then what's the problem?~
@686  = ~I care not which idiotic word you prefer! Brood or sulk - it's all the same.~
@687  = ~*She shrugs.* Well, I suppose, we can dive into the bedroll, while the nosh is boiling.~
@688  = ~Good idea, she-bear!~
@689  = ~Shar-Teel? Are you... are you sulking yourself?~
@690  = ~Stop looking at me like... like that! I don't know. I just felt like talking... but didn't have much to say.~
@691  = ~We've already tallied up today's kills, and sorted the jewels and coin, and-~
@692  = ~And the grub is not ready yet, so we can't go about snorting at <PLAYER2>'s cooking skills or lack of there of. Shar-Teel, maybe you could just sit closer to me, and we can stare at the fire in silence? It could be... er... different.~
@693  = ~Uhm... How about we just hit the sack, she-bear?~
@694  = ~What are you, stupid? I told you how. Bloody sulky.~
@695  = ~Well, look who's all perked up now.~
@696  = ~Ha! It's the strong one's right to do what she pleases. Now shut up, you bore me with your chattering.~
@697  = ~I think I got an idea on how to spice things up. *She slaps your rear.*~
@698  = ~Something in your tone makes me think this isn't exactly what your seeking.~
@699  = ~This is so ridiculous. *Despite her words, Shar-Teel allows herself to slip into your arms. She lays her upon your shoulder... then dozes off.*~
@700  = ~You know what I really want?~
@701  = ~To kill every man in Faerun?~
@702  = ~I have no clue. What is that you really want, Shar-Teel?~
@703  = ~Nope. What?~
@704  = ~I neither know, nor care.~
@705  = ~I'm glad you've mentioned this. It's something we should have discussed a long time ago. You're a drifter, Shar-Teel, wandering aimlessly and killing passers-by. You need to set some goals, work for something in your life.~
@706  = ~*She slaps you.* I hate it when people start putting words in your mouth! Especially when they pervert them. No one ever listens, they just enjoy the sound of their own voices!~
@707  = ~O, fine. Go ahead yell your throat out. But don't expect me to listen.~
@708  = ~Alright, alright. I got the point. Please, tell me what is it that you really want, Shar-Teel?~
@709  = ~You want a serious talk, do you? Alright, I'll give you one. You're a drifter, Shar-Teel... wandering aimlessly and killing passers-by. You need to set some goals, work for something in your life.~
@710  = ~I want to get out from under Fist's reach. Go somewhere, perhaps down to Calimshan... I hear, a strong person can make a fortune there in the slave trade.~
@711  = ~So I was thinking... Let's take the kitty. Dump everyone, especially this drow slut, and travel together for a time. Go someplace nice.~
@712  = ~On the other hand, I'm growing frustrated with having to associate with scum, especially the slimy bard. Let's squish the slug, take the kitty, dump everyone else and travel together for a time. Go someplace nice.~
@713  = ~I was looking at that stupid girl that trails after you as if she is glued to your cloak... and I just can't stand it any more. Let's snap her neck, or dump her with the rest, take the kitty and travel together for a time. Go someplace nice.~
@714  = ~I was thinking... that dwarf is a good fighter, but the rest... let's dump this pathetic squad, take the kitty and travel together for a time. Go someplace nice.~
@715  = ~I figure you're not that pathetic, at least as far as men go. It could be a bloody, fun and profitable expedition, and we'll not be weighed by whiners and fools.~
@716  = ~I do not feel comfortable about letting Imoen go. Yes, she is annoying as the Nine Hells itself, but she is useful.~
@717  = ~Drop Imoen? Are you out of your bloody mind? She is my bestest friend!~
@718  = ~I would not want to lose Viconia's divine spells. Shar is a powerful goddess, and she favors the drow.~
@719  = ~Do not you dare say such things of Viconia! If I could choose, it would have been her, not you!~
@720  = ~Eldoth is a slug, but he sure knows how to sing... I'll keep him for a while.~
@721  = ~Kill Eldoth? And who's going to sing? And the man has a knack for plotting. You have neither talent; in fact, all you can do is to swing that sword of yours. So, if I were you, I'd shut up about dumping people.~
@722  = ~Sounds like a good plan, Shar-Teel, but we can't do it just now. Let me sort out this mess with my father's murderer, and then - we will hit the road together.~
@723  = ~No, Shar-Teel, absolutely not.~
@724  = ~Well, go kiss this little bitch, then.~
@725  = ~O, really? And I thought you were less pathetic than other men. Listen to yourself... 'beeeestest frieeend... *She spits.* Well, remember that I did offer you a cut.~
@726  = ~You are such a fool! I am such a fool! The drow *told* me that she could have you if she wanted... Well, go lick her boots, then.~
@727  = ~*Her gaze growing cold.* Well, remember that I did offer you a cut.~
@728  = ~*She spits and says nothing.*~
@729  = ~I should have guessed that you've swayed that way, weakling. Well, remember that I did offer you a cut.~
@730  = ~Well, it might be that the next time you start unlacing your breeches, I won't care what you want neither.~
@731  = ~As a matter of fact, I do have a goal. Listen up, <CHARNAME>...~
@732  = ~Alright then. But move your ass swifter, <CHARNAME>. I'm growing restless in the company you keep. Morons and weaklings all.~
@733  = ~*Her gaze grow very cold.* Well, remember that I did offer you a cut.~
@734  = ~Well, if it's no, then it's no.~
@735  = ~This Candlekeep place! *She snorts.* It was so bloody quiet there that they called for guards when a spider tried to kill a fly!~
@736  = ~Don't know how you could stay there for so long.~
@737  = ~I wonder myself, Shar-Teel.~
@738  = ~I was instructed in many things that I wished to learn. Quietness, Shar-Teel, is not always synonymous to boredom.~
@739  = ~They fed me alright, and I was trying to put away some money before leaving. It was not that bad, you know.~
@740  = ~I ran away a few times, but Gorion always brought me back, Shar-Teel. When your guardian is a powerful mage, you do not have much choice but to obey his wishes.~
@741  = ~Wonder... you always wonder and do next to nothing. Why, if those monsters did not attack us, I think you would not even get into fights. Pathetic.~
@742  = ~Yeah... but a stupid male flapping his tongue always is.~
@743  = ~'Quetneeeesss, Shaaar-Teeeeel... Phew.~
@744  = ~Why did it irritate you so?~
@745  = ~O, it is useless to try to talk to you! You should go live with goblins or orcs.~
@746  = ~*sigh* Whatever.~
@747  = ~Good grub part I understand. I hate watered beer and salted meat day in and day out myself, but saving money... That Jessup guy said you were running errands. Phew. One can make more money on the road in one day than a serf can do in a month. That's, if a stupid fat man with a thick purse happens along.~
@748  = ~So stop telling me how nice it is to be an errand boy in a shit-hole like Candlekeep.~
@749  = ~Erm... Shar-Teel, I did not-~
@750  = ~Alright.~
@751  = ~*You sigh patiently.* Candlekeep is a famous center of learning, Shar-Teel, and I was a ward to one of its most brilliant mages.~
@752  = ~If you're a chicken. My father was a powerful warrior, or so some say. When I'd run away, he'd beat me, but I kept running away.~
@753  = ~Then I found Ysena. And nobody would go against her wishes, not even my father. Where there is the will, there is a way, <CHARNAME>~
@754  = ~*sarcastically* You are obviously made of tougher stuff than me.~
@755  = ~*soothingly* You are obviously made of tougher stuff than me.~
@756  = ~Uh-huh.~
@757  = ~I never gave up looking for the way out, Shar-Teel, and I did find it in the end.~
@758  = ~Because I hate it when you act condescending.~
@759  = ~I only act condescending when you act stupid.~
@760  = ~I am sorry, I did not mean for it to sound that way, Shar-Teel.~
@761  = ~Maybe I will; at least they would be more interesting to talk to than you!~
@762  = ~What, you are deaf, too? No wonder that you could not even be an errand boy!~
@763  = ~*She shrugs.* Close enough that the difference does not matter.~
@764  = ~You are such a moron.~
@765  = ~Well, I guess I am, at that. *She smiles contentedly.*~
@766  = ~*Shar-Teel's mouth snaps shut. Then she takes your hand and stares at it.* I... I did not mean to yell at you, lover-boy. I just hated that place, Candlekeep. Castles, they all have prisons and gallows... and guards.~
@767  = ~I always said: Scratch a paladin/ranger with a blade and you'll find a man underneath.  Patina is coming right off you, eh, library boy?~
@768  = ~Yes, it's crumbling. The bullshit notions Gorion forced upon me, do not apply to the world outside Candlekeep's walls.~
@769  = ~Shut your mouth! There is a wound in my heart that will not be healed! And you, you dare!~
@770  = ~Given your views on the goody two-shoes and men in general, I am not sure if you are complimenting or scorning me. ~
@771  = ~I always said: Scratch a ranger with a blade and you'll find a man underneath.  Patina is coming right off you, eh, library boy?~
@772  = ~I see that your head is still too big for you. Ha! I'll see to it that self-righteous swelling goes down. "I allow  the party".  Ha!~
@773  = ~But at least you're talking like someone I can come to respect. If that's not all hot air, of course. ~
@774  = ~If you wanted subtlety you'd become a mumbler of spells. Sure, you used to spew drivel all day long, but you were strong too.~
@775  = ~Bugger off! My blade is too good for you. Fall on your own.~
@776  = ~Guess not. And I guess that you are not a bloody fool to regret this. ~
@777  = ~Then crawl to those righteous fools, and lick their boots. Maybe they'd let you back in.~
@778  = ~*Spits* A spineless worm.~
@779  = ~Becoming an ordinary man is not something to boast about, no. But compared to.~
@780  = ~Bloody hells, so maybe I do have hopes for you. So what?!~
@781  = ~I thought that the way things were going, you'd be pleased with a certainlevity I allowed the party. ~
@782  = ~So I'm pleased to hear that. So what?~
@783  = ~*Spit* And for that I abandoned the light? The bloody Nine Hells! There is a wound in my heart that will not be healed! And you, you dare!~
@784  = ~I'm a woman made to dare. And if you don't stop shrieking like a hen, I'll make you a real wound in your heart.~
@785  = ~You cannot possibly understand the tragedy of losing the Blessing, of drifting away from the Light and knowing, knowing all along that it's your own fault and not having the strength to do anything about it. ~
@786  = ~Thank you. I needed this. I guess, I was not cut out to be a paladin. ~
@787  = ~Thank you. I needed this. I guess, I was not cut out to be a ranger. ~
@788  = ~Bring your sword, Shar-Teel. Here is my chest. ~
@789  = ~Subtlety is not your strong suit, huh? You need a sledge-hammer to drive your point across.~
@790  = ~Now you're talking like someone I can come to respect. If that's not all hot air, of course. ~
@791  = ~Well, <CHARNAME>, I think the moment our battle with Sarevok will be finished, you'd run for home. Men always miss their homes. Pathetic.~
@792  = ~I do miss Candlekeep. Since I left, it seems that I've found nothing but peril, darkness and no shortage of bastards willing to slit my throat in exchange for coin.~
@793  = ~Candlekeep is long behind me. The wider world offers me more by way of blood and coin.~
@794  = ~Pfah! Candlekeep, home of good-for-nothing monks and peasants disguised as soldiers. I only regret the years of my life I've wasted there.~
@795  = ~Candlekeep was my home and a place of peace. I will return one day, although it's adventure that I want now.~
@796  = ~Must you always talk in the thinly veiled insults?~
@797  = ~And I was one of them. The bastards willing to slit your throat, I mean.~
@798  = ~You still are willing, aren't you?~
@799  = ~I thought we were friends, Shar-Teel.~
@800  = ~I'm aware of that, which is why I have my eye on you.~
@801  = ~Ah! Well, you're not completely stupid. I had expected vomit-inducing sentiment from you, not healthy wanderlust.~
@802  = ~I'm full of surprises.~
@803  = ~Well, if it's vomit-inducing sentiment you're after...~
@804  = ~My appetite for adventure surprised me, too. From the state of your boots, I think you feel the same way.~
@805  = ~And what's your idea of adventure? This tramping along roads, scurrying to fulfill tasks for pissant amounts of gold... a street cat has a better life! At least, it gets to taste blood on its duty.~
@806  = ~Your penchant for animal imagery is amusing, Shar-Teel. We've been pigs, dogs, rats and street cats now. What's next, goats?~
@807  = ~With an attitude like that, it's not surprising that you don't have many friends.~
@808  = ~Don't put words in my mouth. Adventure to me means fighting, a test of strength on strength.~
@809  = ~Ha! I suppose that's your way of fighting, as well - sidestep the blow, instead of taking it like a true warrior.~
@810  = ~You take all the blows square on? I suppose it would explain the astonishing lack of intelligence you demonstrate time and again.~
@811  = ~I take the blows that are fair and have substance, rather than those full of windy breath. To answer your question before, I see adventure as a chance to test myself and my powers. Fulfilling tasks is only a small part.~
@812  = ~Pfeh. You fight your way, I'll fight mine, and we'll see who dies of cowardice. Beyond that, I've nothing further to say to you. Now get lost, before I give in to the urge to smash your face.~
@813  = ~Of course. For a fair amount of coin, I'll do so. Or when boredom strikes.~
@814  = ~You don't have too many friends, do you?~
@815  = ~You realize that the same goes for you. Bore me, and your life ends, Shar-Teel.~
@816  = ~That's something that can change anytime. I don't care much for your company.~
@817  = ~You lie. Why travel with me, if you feel this way?~
@818  = ~I'll not give up on your friendship, Shar-Teel. You've stayed with me this long, so you must enjoy my company~
@819  = ~Friends? Pfaugh - I have no need for friends.~
@820  = ~Yet you are willing to travel with me.~
@821  = ~And neither have I. At least, not for a dour she-warrior who is more trouble than she's worth.~
@822  = ~You're no more to me than an extra body between me and the enemy. Beyond that, you're not much more than a source of gold. And annoyance. A LOT of annoyance.~
@823  = ~If that's the way you feel, then leave. I have no need for someone like you here.~
@824  = ~If we didn't need your strength, I would have killed you for saying that. Speak no more, Shar-Teel, unless you want to die.~
@825  = ~Again you lie. Insults come to you so naturally that I doubt you even realize what you're saying.~
@826  = ~If you must beg for my acceptance, I will say that you keep me from being bored to tears. Something about you attracts enemies like flies. It's probably the stench all men seem to have.~
@827  = ~Gladly.~
@828  = ~I expected no less from you. I'll be watching my back, as well.~
@829  = ~It doesn't have to be this way. We should learn to work together, if we wish to travel together.~
@830  = ~Then we shall continue in an uneasy truce. It is a shame that we cannot trust each other, Shar-Teel.~
@831  = ~Yes.~
@832  = ~I only wish to be friends.~
@833  = ~In that case, I'd prefer it if you didn't talk at all.~
@834  = ~Then consider these my final words to you, scum.~
@835  = ~You certainly are full of something.~
@836  = ~Must you always insult me?~
@837  = ~As are you, bitch. I tire of your acid tongue.~
@838  = ~Do you even think before you spew out the latest insult?~
@839  = ~NO.~
@840  = ~Oh, a joke, <CHARNAME>? You're ever the fool.~
@841  = ~But the ghost of a smile crossed your face. Perhaps, before long, we'll be toasting each other's friendship by the fire.~
@842  = ~And you're ever dour. I'll tell you once and for all, Shar-Teel, lighten up, woman, or shut up.~
@843  = ~Well, you're the one who's willingly traveling with a 'fool'.~
@844  = ~I'm no wet-eared adventurer, <CHARNAME>. I travel, because it stops guards from beheading me in the night, or worse, locking me in a cell to fester.~
@845  = ~But it must be a lonely life. Don't you wish for companionship, perhaps a friend or two to talk to on your travels?~
@846  = ~Your life has not been easy.~
@847  = ~It's a shame that you're a useless pig, but then, we can't change destiny.~
@848  = ~No, but it's been eventful. And bloody. Beyond that, I have no wants.~
@849  = ~How about friends?~
@850  = ~I pity you, Shar-Teel, and your tiny mindset.~
@851  = ~There are worse things than a fool's pity. Don't waste my time with your attentions, if you pity me.~
@852  = ~It is the only thing about you that I pity. The rest is admirable. You have my attention, whether you like it or not.~
@853  = ~Then that's the last scrap of advice I'll take from you. From now on, you are nothing to me but a useful sword arm.~
@854  = ~I think the answer to that is surely the 'not', <CHARNAME>.~ ~But keep prattling if you wish. It makes our path less boring. Which reminds me - we should find someone to kill, and soon.~
@855  = ~Believe me when I say that I prefer it that way.~
@856  = ~So, how did you like my father, <CHARNAME>?~
@857  = ~He seemed to care about you, Shar-Teel. In his own way.~
@858  = ~I have not made up my mind about him, Shar-Teel.~
@859  = ~He is a disgusting exemplar, all right.~
@860  = ~I think you two have things in common.~
@861  = ~He is a good enough man, I suppose. He let us off the hook and all that.~
@862  = ~CARE about me? All he cares about is his reputation among other corrupted swine like him!~
@863  = ~Then you two have even more things in common than I previously thought.~
@864  = ~He let us go and all that, because of you.~
@865  = ~And these 'corrupted swine' would have berated him for hanging his own daughter? I think not, Shar-Teel. There is a shred of honor left in him. And he... he must love you, Shar-Teel... in his own way.~
@866  = ~Alright, have it your own way. He is a bastard and a crook.~
@867  = ~I just... have not made up my mind about him, Shar-Teel.~
@868  = ~And when do you ever 'make up' your miserable little mind? Does it hurt so much to think? You are pathetic!~
@869  = ~You say it like you don't care either way!~
@870  = ~Shar-Teel, please... I have more important things on my mind than assessing each and every of your father's shortcomings and the exact degree of his vileness.~
@871  = ~It goes against my upbringing to utilize the exact expressions brought up to my mind by the meeting with your father in front of a lady.~
@872  = ~I said exactly what you wanted to hear. Now leave me be.~
@873  = ~Well, let us say that I was relieved that the necessity of my asking him for your hand in marriage is practically nil.~
@874  = ~WHAT? I am nothing like my father!~
@875  = ~Right you are. You are nothing like your father.~
@876  = ~You are both strong and have no respect for the written law.~
@877  = ~You both serve an accomplished bastard of a master.~
@878  = ~You have his looks, Shar-Teel.~
@879  = ~I remember that you said that he treated women worse than dirt under his feet. I think that you treat men in exactly the same way.~
@880  = ~Why do you defend him?~
@881  = ~Ye, gods! I did not fancy seeing myself hung by my neck until I died. I liked it well enough that he released us. Compared to that, all your complaints about him are petty.~
@882  = ~Shar-Teel, I do not like where this conversation is heading.~
@883  = ~I should not have. He is a pathetic male swine.~
@884  = ~And that is why he said that he hopes to never see me again? You are an idiot, if you think he loves me. To love means to respect! And he never respected a woman in his life!~
@885  = ~You treat men in exactly the same way that you say he treats women. The disdain toward the opposite sex must run in your family.~
@886  = ~Whatever you say, she-bear.~
@887  = ~Well, maybe then I have better things to do than helping you to catch your father's murderer!~
@888  = ~*She snorts.* I am no lady, but thanks anyway. You swear like a peasant.~
@889  = ~Bah.~
@890  = ~*She guffaws.* You bet!~
@891  = ~Asking my hand in marriage! What a load of...~
@892  = ~Tell you what - I hear that the gentle born ladies find it noble to set a challenge for their suitors, like killing a dragon or defeating some other critter. I decided to set one for you: if you ever want to marry me, bugger the dragons' hides. Bring me my father's head. On a pike.~
@893  = ~*grudgingly* You have that right, lover-boy. Only I do not crawl on my belly, and I lick nobody's boots.~
@894  = ~*angrily* You got the bastard part right, lover-boy. Only I do not crawl on my belly, and I lick nobody's boots.~
@895  = ~*sullenly* Bugger off.~
@896  = ~What! You pathetic fool! What are you smirking at?! At least I am justified in my views.~
@897  = ~I... Alright. I will think about it. Later.~
@898  = ~*She hisses.* I wish he did not. You deserve a noose.~
@899  = ~Well, that's it, lover-boy. Don't fret, I won't let your brother to gut you like a fish. That privilege is mine!~
@900  = ~*You smile.* You are ever so tender, she-bear. Don't you have anything better for me than scorn?~
@901  = ~*quietly* Come here for a moment, Shar-Teel.~
@902  = ~And I won't let him so much as break a nail on your fingers!~
@903  = ~Thank you, Shar-Teel. It's very reassuring.~
@904  = ~You get yourself killed, lover-boy, and I'd give you a tongue lashing that would make you regret that you have ears! *She abruptly wraps you in a bear hug.* Be careful, <CHARNAME>.~
@905  = ~What for? *But her voice drops almost to a whisper, and she walks over to you.*~
@906  = ~*You lift her chin and kiss her.* For this, she-bear.~
@907  = ~*You caress her cheek.* I do not want to die without telling you this: I love you, Shar-Teel.~
@908  = ~*You embrace her.* Shar-Teel, should I die there... should I die, I want you to-~
@909  = ~Never mind.~
@910  = ~*quietly* It's not me he is after, lover boy.~
@911  = ~I am glad that you have found it amusing. *She turns away quickly; could the glimmer that you have glimpsed in her eyes be a tear?*~
@912  = ~Stop it! I am not going into battle in a plate covered by mush...~
@913  = ~Ah, bugger that!~
@914  = ~*Shar-Teel kisses you hard.*~
@915  = ~Fight well, <CHARNAME>, and don't even think to get yourself killed.~
@916  = ~I will do nothing of the kind!~
@917  = ~Yeah. Never mind.~
@918  = ~*Shar-Teel is sorting lazily through the latest booty. It seems that she has spent more time at it than usual.*~
@919  = ~Did anything attract your interest in particular, she-bear?~
@920  = ~*Kneel by Shar-Teel and try to figure out what had caught her eye.*~
@921  = ~*Leave her to her scavenging.*~
@922  = ~None of your bloody business. These are the party's spoils, and I'll take what I want for my share.~
@923  = ~Yes, yes, of course. I was just curious what is was that could attract your attention and still be smaller than a battle axe.~
@924  = ~How else should I know that you aren't taking more than your due?~
@925  = ~It is my business to know, she-bear. It's the only way I stay alive. Now, what is it that you took for yourself?~
@926  = ~Shar-Teel, we sell every prize that we win, apart from gear that we can use. So put that back immediately... whatever it is that you took. And have the decency not to steal from your own companions.~
@927  = ~*Shar-Teel seems unable to let go of a plain ring with a half-translucent grey stone in it. When she twists it in her hands, you see bright red streaks veining through it.*~
@928  = ~Bloodstone! No wonder you liked it, Shar-Teel!~
@929  = ~Shar-Teel, we sell every prize that we win, apart from gear that we can use. So put that back immediately... whatever it is that you took. Have the decency not to steal from your own companions.~
@930  = ~*With a contented sigh, Shar-Teel stashes away a plain ring with a half-translucent grey stone set in it; red streaks vein through the quartz in a complex web.*~
@931  = ~*Upon noticing that you're observing her, she scowls at you.* These are the party's spoils. I'll take what I want for my share.~
@932  = ~Shar-Tee, we sell every prize that we win, apart from gear that we can use. So put that back immediately... whatever it is that you took. Have the decency not to steal from your own companions.~
@933  = ~A ring? Well, take it. I hope you are not planning to propose to me, with your twisted sense of gender roles.~
@934  = ~You want this... trinket? Shar-Teel, I'm surprised!~
@935  = ~*Shar-Teel glares.* I lay claim to this!~
@936  = ~*She thrusts her hand at you, so quickly that she almost breaks your windpipe. Lucky for you that your reflexes are still in tact... You dodge the blow just in time.*~
@937  = ~*In her palm, she holds plain ring with a half-translucent grey stone set in it; red streaks vein through quartz in a complex web.*~
@938  = ~Shar-Teel, we sell every prize that we win, apart from gear that we can use. So put that back immediately. Have the decency not to steal from your own companions.~
@939  = ~*An unpleasant smile creeps over Shar-Teel's lips.* You just have to trust me, lover-boy. Or do you want to fight over what I have taken?~
@940  = ~What was it that attracted your attention and was smaller than a battle axe?~
@941  = ~N-no. Please, have whatever you want. It's a gift.~
@942  = ~Yes, as a matter of fact, I do!~
@943  = ~Shar-Teel, we sell every prize that we win, apart from gear that we canuse. So put that back immediately... whatever it is that you took. Have the decency not to steal from your companions.~
@944  = ~*Shar-Teel openly grabs the closest saddlebag and leaves.*~
@945  = ~*Challenge her passage.*~
@946  = ~*Let her go.*~
@947  = ~I like stones - they are hard and tough, and this one has spirit.~
@948  = ~If you like red stones, I will give you a ruby, once we come across one, she-bear.~
@949  = ~*shrug* Well, take it, then. I hope you are not planning to propose to me with this stupid ring, seeing how you have such a twisted sense of gender roles and all.~
@950  = ~Spirit, Shar-Teel? Did you turn to some barbarian beliefs?~
@951  = ~Right, right. I am glad you like it.~
@952  = ~No chance of that, dolt. I intend to marry a shy virginal boy... blushing prettily at the sight of me from under his golden curls.~
@953  = ~As if I cared. I like it, and I'll take it!~
@954  = ~Good. That's how I like it. *Shar-Teel pockets a bloodstone ring. It looks plain, but for the red streaks that vein through grey quartz in a complex web.*~
@955  = ~I will oblige! *Shar-Teel bares her blade.*~
@956  = ~*Let her be.*~
@957  = ~Bah. Rubies, sapphires, emeralds - these are for soft women with the imaginations of magpies, attracted to shiny things. Let them pay us in singing coin for them. This one, it has character. And I like the name. Bloodstone.~
@958  = ~One has to be blind to miss that the stone is greedy for slaughter.~
@959  = ~Why are you making us to lug about this dead weight? Books won't fetch us more than a copper!~
@960  = ~Perhaps I am nostalgic, she-bear. Remember, I grew up in a library.~
@961  = ~A man who wouldn't stoop to pick up a copper is not worth a copper! Those merchants might not give us a fortune for books, but we still make a profit on 'em, Shar-Teel, since we paid naught in the first place.~
@962  = ~If I told you to carry a sack full of stones, you'd carry it. So don't ask stupid questions. I am in command here. Is that understood, Shar-Teel?~
@963  = ~Why, to build muscles and endurance, of course. Let's face it, some of our companions are weaklings.~
@964  = ~Why, to build muscles and endurance, of course.~
@965  = ~Like that's something to be proud about!~
@966  = ~Books have their uses, she-bear.~
@967  = ~You know what? If I told you to carry a sack full of stones, you'd carry it. So don't ask stupid questions. I am in command here. Is that understood, Shar-Teel?~
@968  = ~Hmm... Think about it this way: we need books to build muscles and endurance. Let's face it, some of our companions are weaklings.~
@969  = ~Hmm... Think about it this way: we need books to build muscles and endurance.~
@970  = ~Yeah, one has to count coppers to count gold afterwards. I like profits as well as the next woman, but <CHARNAME>, if we get caught stealing *books* from some measly towner's house, I'd cut your arm before the Fists get to it. As well as your tongue.~
@971  = ~Don't be afraid, my fragile beauty. We won't get caught. I'm too good for that.~
@972  = ~Hmm... Think about it this way: We need books to build muscles and endurance.~
@973  = ~O, you think me stupid, do you? Let me repeat to you what you've just said... So you can be sure it wasn't lost on me.~
@974  = ~You said that you are a cur, who imagines he can run with wolves. Well, I have news for you - wolves must fight for leadership of the pack.~
@975  = ~I see your point, Shar-Teel. You are the strongest, so I should let you lead.~
@976  = ~Shar-Teel, we are both strong and want to lead the pack. But you are a woman and I am a man, therefore I shall grant you your wish. The leadership is yours.~
@977  = ~A, a man should never lower himself to arguing with a woman. You don't want us carrying books, dear? Fine. We will not carry books.~
@978  = ~Then let us fight, bitch!~
@979  = ~Yeah, well. Next time we're in town, round us up some more muscle, so we can replace this sorry excuse for a party.~
@980  = ~*You are glad that you've pacified Shar-Teel.*~
@981  = ~*You may be pushing your luck, but you feel a veritable dare-devil to<DAYNIGHT>...* Books have other uses as well, she-bear.~
@982  = ~If carrying books around improved strength, you should have been as strong as a troll, after all those years running errands for the monks in Candlekeep. But then, think of the monks themselves. Why, they should be stronger than the giants!~
@983  = ~*You are glad that you've managed to pacify Shar-Teel.*~
@984  = ~Actually, the Candlekeep monks that venerate Oghma are all strong and fair wrestlers besides, just like their deity.~
@985  = ~We? *I* am strong enough. As for you... If carrying books around improved strength, you should have been as strong as a troll, after all those years running errands for the monks in Candlekeep. But then, think of the monks themselves. Why, they should be stronger than giants!~
@986  = ~Don't you be taking this preaching tone with me again, lover-boy.~
@987  = ~You are obviously tired, Shar-Teel. Let's leave this argument till... never.~
@988  = ~*You smile lazily and open the History of the Dead Three carefully.* Just listen for a moment. This one has murders and betrayal, and the struggle of gods... You start reading: "In ages past there was but one god of strife, death, and the dead, and he was known as Jergal, Lord of the End of Everything..."~
@989  = ~*You smile lazily and open the History of the Dales and Elven Court carefully.* Just listen for a moment. This one has plenty of battles and bloodshed. You start reading: "The founding of the Dalelands long preceded the creation of any of the existing Dales by hundreds of years, and the year numbering system known as Dalereckoning is actually a commemoration of humankind being given permission to settle in the lands north and west of the Inner Sea..."~
@990  = ~*You smile lazily and open the History of the Fateful Coin carefully.* Just listen for a moment. This one is about luck and fate of each and every one of us. You start reading: "Old tales tell that luck plays a crucial role in each person's life. When each new-born baby enters the Realms, Tymora flips a coin formed from the remnants of the original goddess of luck, Tyche..."~
@991  = ~*You smile lazily and open the History of the Last March of Giants carefully.* Just listen for a moment. This one is about the dangers of loyalty. You might like it. You start reading: "East of the Great Rift in the Eastern Shaar once stood a land of the titans. This empire rose at the dawn of time in Faerun, and its lords thought to challenge the gods in their arrogance. In punishment, the powers cursed the reigning monarch with fascination and his brethren with devotion..."~
@992  = ~*You smile lazily and open the History of the Fateful Coin carefully.* Just listen for a moment. This one is about luck and fate of each and every one of us. You start reading: "Old tales tell that luck plays a crucial role in each person's life. When each new-born baby enters the Realms, Tymora flips a coin formed from the remnants of the original goddess of luck, Tyche..." ~
@993  = ~*snorts* I've seen far better thieves than you caught in Baldur's Gate. Now bugger off.~
@994  = ~*You may be pushing your luck, but you feel a veritable dare-devil to<DAYNIGHT>...* Books have their uses, she-bear.~
@995  = ~Coming from you, I shall take this as a declaration of love.~
@996  = ~*She spits.* A leader who surrenders his position for asking. Now, that's pathetic.~
@997  = ~*A malevolent grin twists Shar-Teel's mouth.* Finally.~
@998  = ~How about we carry your dead body instead, *dear*?~
@999  = ~*She snorts derisively.* Who is there to wrestle with in Candlekeep? Rats? Choristers?~
@1000 = ~The... the other monks of Oghma, she-bear.~
@1001 = ~Try it, and I will deal you out a blow strong enough to render you deaf.~
@1002 = ~Hardened by carrying the books and unrolling the scrolls, no doubt. Will you stop being stupid already? I'm about to lose my patience with you.~
@1003 = ~*She curls up by you, propping her head against your thigh. Some unreadable expression appears on her grim face. A dreamer is not how you'd describe her at the moment, but she seems to enjoy it.*~
@1004 = ~*With a sudden certainty, you know that nobody ever read books to her aloud when she was little.*~
@1005 = ~*You place your hand on Shar-Teel's head.*~
@1006 = ~*You continue reading.*~
@1007 = ~*You cough.* I was thinking, Shar-Teel, did anyone ever read books to you when you were little? Your father or your mother?~
@1008 = ~What a stupid waste of time! If I ever wanted to read the bloody book, I could do it on my own much faster.~
@1009 = ~*She grabs the book out of your hands and stuffs it back into the pack.*~
@1010 = ~*Shar-Teel turns over... the same strange docile expression on her face.*~
@1011 = ~*You lean over and kiss her gently.*~
@1012 = ~*You cough.* I was thinking, Shar-Teel, have anyone ever read you books when you were little? Your father or your mother?~
@1013 = ~No. *She cuts off your reply and glares at you in offense.*~
@1014 = ~And who needs that, anyway?~
@1015 = ~*Shar-Teel responds to your kiss and rises slowly, following your lips, until she can embrace you. In the ominous silence, Shar-Teel's caresses are the most delicate you've ever enjoyed from her. This is the only time the fighter has given herself to you, instead of taking you. Perhaps, come morning, she'll regret it...*~
@1016 = ~You pick a single bud for this light-skirt, and I'd shove it right up where the sun never shines! Yes, and to help it slide right in, I'd push it along with my sword.~
@1017 = ~Don't worry, it's just flowers.~
@1018 = ~That's the imagery I did not need...~
@1019 = ~Are you... jealous?~
@1020 = ~I've warned you!~
@1021 = ~You... you have picked this stinking weeds for your hussy! Don't bother to deny it, you, creep!~
@1022 = ~*Your formidable mate, Shar-Teel, turns toward you, all strength and grace, if little of pleasantness.*~ [X#BLANK]
@1023 = ~*She glowers at you, until you start feeling that your attire is about to start smoking under this smoldering gaze.*~
@1024 = ~"One day," she announces gloomily, "One day, I'll gut you like a fish."~
@1025 = ~*She grips your shoulders and twists them, till your muscles are strained near to breaking.* What? It was you who were asking for a back massage, you, lout.~
@1026 = ~*She envelops you into a bear hug, nigh lifting you off the ground. Embracement factor aside, it feels surprisingly safe being encircled with her strong arms.*~
@1027 = ~*growls* Men!~
@1028 = ~*growls* Don't ever stare at my ass like that!~
@1029 = ~*growls* So, that's what you meant about putting more padding under my armor! Jerk! You want them bigger, go find a cow!~
@1030 = ~*growls* Don't smile, it makes you look hopeful and stupid.~
@1031 = ~*growls* If you want to get some tonight, you'd better find us a tough fight. I need my blood high to suffer you again!~
@1032 = ~*growls* What?!~
@1033 = ~*shoots you a crooked smile* Lover-boy.~
@1034 = ~*with a grim scowl* Lover-boy.~
@1035 = ~*She scowls, but there are so many emotions tangled in her scowl that you dare not interpret this facial impression one way or another.*~
@1036 = ~*She scowls... Oh, how she scowls. Like no one else under the sun, the moon and the stars.*~
@1037 = ~*She glowers... Her eyes are like stars... shooting stars... or Melf's Minute Meteors... Uhm, make it Melf's Acid Arrows.*~
@1038 = ~*She scowls... It's her ninety-eighth scowl since the last sunrise. She is well underway to beat her yesterday's personal best.*~
@1039 = ~*She scowls...* Don't you dare to tell me not to scowl, dolt!~
@1040 = ~*She looks at you and tries to scowl. She fails.* What the...~
@1041 = ~*The scowl blooms again on her lips*~
@1042 = ~*She looks at you and tries to scowl. She smiles instead and turns away quickly.*~
@1043 = ~*She looks at you, and her hand comes to rest on her sword hilt involuntarily.*~
@1044 = ~*She gives you such a dark look that shivers run up your spine*~
@1045 = ~Oh, bugger off.~
@1046 = ~*She gives you a rough shove on your back. A veiled caress, perhaps.*~
@1047 = ~*Shar-Teel pats your face, smothering dirt and grime that resided there, and adding to it generously.*~
@1048 = ~*Shar-Teel bits off a broken fingernail and spits it on the ground. It seems that it was purely accidental that she looked your way while er... grooming herself.*~
@1049 = ~*Shar-Teel rolls her shoulders back and forth in an impressive display of her raw power.*~
@1050 = ~*She snarls, showing a row of surprisingly white, even teeth. Only one is broken, which is a testimony to her skill in battle and brawl.*~
@1051 = ~*She pushes back her hair, mated with sweat and blood, and stares at you, unblinking. Her eyes are surprisingly... pretty.*~
@1052 = ~*Shar-Teel squints at you, as if you were a mortal enemy or something impossibly bright.*~
@1053 = ~*Shar-Teel grabs your arm, above elbow.* Move along, and shut your trap. You must have swallowed a dozen of flies already while gawking at me.~
@1054 = ~*Shar-Teel elbows you sharply.* Huh.~
@1055 = ~*Shar-Teel, the mighty she-warrior that shares your blankets by night, walks over to you.*~ [X#BLANK]
@1056 = ~*She half-turns, and the motion reminds you of how she rises in the mornings, pads over to the pile of clothes to find her things and from there throws that last hungry look your way.*~
@1057 = ~*She grunts.* You'd better not put a stupid spell on me to get me into your bedroll.~
@1058 = ~*She shakes her fist under your nose.* Don't you think that I am some gullible girl to fall for smooth talking!~
@1059 = ~*She rams into you with sudden fierceness...*~
@1060 = ~*Shar-Teel walks by your side for a few moments, then suddenly trips you. She is certainly amused by you landing onto your face.*~
@1061 = ~*Shar-Teel's eyes narrow to two dagger points. It is with a certain relief that you notice that you are not the object of her glare. She was simply looking around.*~
@1062 = ~*She... yawns.* What, it's not like you got more sleep than I last night, lover-boy.~
@1063 = ~Bloody Hells! Bugger this stupid- *Ah, that had nothing to do with you. Shar-Teel swears by the same reason that the elves sing - it's their nature.*~
@1064 = ~*She takes your hand in hers gently. At least she meant to. It ends up being a rough gesture of a sailor who tugs on a rope to check a knot.*~
@1065 = ~You're on the right track, lover-boy. Just talk less before we slaughter.~
@1066 = ~Shit. I'm sweating like a pig, with all this marching around. Let's fight someone already, or we can stop, and you can loosen my shirt for me.~
@1067 = ~Stand still, lover-boy. *She dabs blood off your face with an edge of her weatherworn cloak.*~
@1068 = ~You are flimsy like a flea. Aye, and just as irritating when you jump on me. *laughs*~
@1069 = ~*She grabs your bottom and gives it a hard squeeze. Luckily, she did not get to the bone.*~
@1070 = ~You know what? Try not to lose an eye. I bloody like them.~
@1071 = ~Sometimes I wish that I had a room to keep my trophies, like hunters do. I'd put up all the stuffed man-heads on the walls, and sit there in the evenings... So peaceful.~
@1072 = ~*dreamily* I heard that there are spiders that gobble down their mates after copulating.~
@1073 = ~*growls* Watch where you're going! You keep popping up near me. It's bloody frustrating!~
@1074 = ~*guffaws and shakes her head* Lover-boy, burst my gut!~
@1075 = ~*She notices that you look at her and pointedly ignores you.*~
@1076 = ~*Shar-Teel undoes her straps and takes off her helmet. She rolls her head from one shoulder to the other, affording you a fine view of the smooth column of her neck. Then she motions for you to help her to set the helm back in place.*~
@1077 = ~*She looks you over and purses her lips.*~
@1078 = ~*She wets her lips.* Long past time for a drink of something other than putrid water.~
@1079 = ~Raised by monks, huh. In the citadel of learning, huh. And turned out alright. Go figure.~
@1080 = ~I heard a bard whining another day, about love. How it makes her weaker. Don't know what she's doing wrong, but every time I lay with you, it's like that spell that boosts one's strength.~
@1081 = ~Why, you do look like there is no single thought in your head. Stop gaping at me and keep walking - you do it by placing one foot in front of another, in case you'd have forgotten.~
@1082 = ~I was dreaming another night - we were dancing on a pile of bloody corpses. And right next to it there was a pile of gold, just as large. I hope it's prophetic.~
@1083 = ~*She kicks you in your shin.* That's for drooling.~
@1084 = ~*Her hand lands heavily on your shoulder.* You do better when you don't think much, lover-boy. Such a pretty face - why spoil it with wrinkles?~
@1085 = ~*Your lover Shar-Teel strides by your side, with a dangerous grace of a true blade master.*~ [X#BLANK]
@1086 = ~*She looks at you, her head cocked to one side, and a slow smile stretches her lips.*~
@1087 = ~*A low, rumbling growl starts deep in her chest.*~
@1088 = ~*With sudden intensity, Shar-Teel presses her lips onto yours. She swirls her tongue inside your mouth - a tornado touchdown, no more, no less...*~
@1089 = ~*Shar-Teel walking side by side with a man, without trying to hurt or kill him... that is something you've thought impossible but a few short weeks ago.*~
@1090 = ~*Shar-Teel might walk side by side with you, but there is no more tameness to her than to a hunting she-bear.*~
@1091 = ~*She touches your face. With true gentleness... And recoils, grimmer than any snake.*~
@1092 = ~A few more scars, and you'd stop looking like a babe in the woods. Or not.~
@1093 = ~You need a tattoo here, on your cheek. Something fierce - to remind me of how you are between the sheets.~
@1094 = ~We will never die, hey-hoo!
while there is gold for taking
and the sun is bright, hey-hoo!
Over the bloodied sails!~
@1095 = ~Have you ever thought of taking up pirating, <CHARNAME>? I heard there are good pickings in the Race, near the Pirate Isles.~
@1096 = ~*excitedly* That was quite a sight, when I beheaded him. There is nothing sweeter than one powerful blow to send the head flying up in a fountain of blood!~
@1097 = ~*She balls her hands into fists.* I'm itching for a fight, lover-boy. And for a blood sausage. And- *She suddenly stops. It remains for you to guess what was it that she was thinking about.*~
@1098 = ~You'd make one heck of a woman, <CHARNAME>.~
@1099 = ~You are like an orcish arrowhead with hooks. I keep feeling you inside me, and I' m afraid to pull it out. And I don't mean when we lay together. I mean... I mean all the time.~
@1100 = ~I still can run you through the guts with my sword and open you up like a fish. *She sounds comforted by the thought.*~
@1101 = ~*She gives you an angry glare and stalks away.*~
@1102 = ~*The sword leading, she feints an attack at you and grins approvingly as you, used to being always on your toes in her presence, sidestep it easily.*~
@1103 = ~*She cuts the air with the rib of her palm, in a quick, sweeping motion.* And all shall fall before us, <CHARNAME>!~
@1104 = ~*She gives you a playful tug on your hair.*~
@1105 = ~*She is preoccupied with painting a half-mask on her face with ochre.* Ysena considered it lucky, <CHARNAME>. Mask's favor won't hurt.~
@1106 = ~*Shar-Teel moves closer to you, and her thigh brushes past yours a few times.*~
@1107 = ~*Shar-Teel casually wraps her arm around your waist and pats your hip.*~
@1108 = ~*Shar-Teel's hand travels down your back and dives behind your belt. You can feel her sword-roughened hot palm on your lower back.*~
@1109 = ~*Shar-Teel grips you chin and forces you to lean your head and kiss her.*~
@1110 = ~*Shar-Teel eyes what's below your beltline. You think that there is approval, rather than amusement, in her eyes.*~
@1111 = ~Men are pathe-~
@1112 = ~Well, there are exceptions.~
@1113 = ~An exception.~
@1114 = ~*Shar-Teel scowls at you. Come to think of it, you are so used to her scowling by now that you find it almost endearing.*~
@1115 = ~*She pokes you into your ribs.*~
@1116 = ~Lover-boy...~
@1117 = ~*None of your ribs are broken. As a matter of fact, it was just a light and silly poke.*~
@1118 = ~*Her fingers touch your wrist and withdraw.*~
@1119 = ~*Shar-Teel cleans her nails with her dagger. She pays you no mind.*~
@1120 = ~*Shar-Teel's eyes blaze from under her furrowed brow. The battle lust is writ all over her face still. Then she seems to have noticed you. Her lips half-part, and her eyes darken.*~
@1121 = ~I want you, lover-boy. Now.~
