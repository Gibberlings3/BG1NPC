@0    = ~My lady, we formed our alliance to fight the bandits threatening travelers in this area. May I ask your motivation for pursuing such a tedious and dangerous task?~
@1    = ~Ajantis, these bandits might be the murderers of my foster father Gorion.~
@2    = ~I am a paladin! I can not stand idly by while innocent people are injured or even killed!~
@3    = ~I am fighting to do good, Ajantis, just like you.~
@4    = ~I don't know why we have to talk about my real motives, Ajantis. We are here and we are fighting together. That's all you need to know.~
@5    = ~I figured the rewards would be worthwhile, that's all.~
@6    = ~Yes, of course. But why the bandits of the Sword Coast? Is there any specific reason for you to be here?~
@7    = ~These bandits might be the murderers of my foster father Gorion!~
@8    = ~I've heard of the problems and thought this would be a quest suitable for me.~
@9    = ~Well, here or elsewhere, the location really doesn't matter.~
@10   = ~You don't need to know any more, Ajantis.~
@11   = ~That is all? It is surprising how two people performing the same task can have such different motivation. I hope that the anticipated reward will be sufficient to allow you to retire from combating the criminals around here!~
@12   = ~However, we aim for the same goal, so I will fight at your side against these wrongdoers with all my might. But beware: I shall watch your steps with every sense that Helm has given me.~
@13   = ~I will remain true to my duties as a paladin, and I will be firm, if I see evil in any of your actions.~
@14   = ~That is what you do, indeed, my lady.~
@15   = ~Those are ambitious words, my lady. We will see whether your actions will prove them to be true.~
@16   = ~By Helm! This is very sad news, my lady. Let me express my deepest condolences for your loss.~
@17   = ~Thank you for your kind words, Ajantis. Gorion was my father, my mentor, and my only family. I will not stop until I find those responsible for his murder!~
@18   = ~Gorion died while defending me... But what makes it even worse is the fact *I* was the one they were after, not Gorion.~
@19   = ~Thank you. When they took Gorion from me... I am sorry, Ajantis, I can't talk about this any longer. It is just too upsetting for me.~
@20   = ~It's all right. Dwelling on it won't bring him back.~
@21   = ~You could do good at many other places. Why the bandits of the Sword Coast? Is there any specific reason for you to be here?~
@22   = ~I am sorry, my lady, but I have to contradict you. You are our battle commander, and you will make decisions during our campaign that will be directly affected by your reasons for joining this righteous undertaking. To be able to trust you in dangerous situations, I have to know your motives!~
@23   = ~I am a paladin! Like you, I can not stand idly by while innocent people are injured or even killed!~
@24   = ~You are here to help me fight the bandits, not to badger me about my reasons for wanting them dead. End of discussion.~
@25   = ~I see... It is a great task, my lady, and I am sworn to perform it. I will fight at your side against these criminals with all my might.~
@26   = ~My lady, your dismissive answer saddens me. I have the impression that you are not interested in my opinion. Very well. I will keep my thoughts to myself in the future.~
@27   = ~I will fight at your side against these evildoers with all my might. But beware: I shall watch your steps with every sense that Helm has given me. I will remain true to my duties as a paladin, and I will be firm if I see evil in any of your actions.~
@28   = ~I see... It is a great task, my lady, and I am sworn to perform it.~
@29   = ~I will fight at your side against these evildoers with all my might.~
@30   = ~But beware: I shall watch your steps with every sense that Helm has given me. I will remain true to my duties as a paladin, and I will be firm if I see evil in any of your actions.~
@31   = ~My lady, I fully understand your grief and pain. But do not let yourself be overwhelmed by vengeance and hatred. You can only hope to hunt down these murderers if you are not blinded by hate, and if you do not let your thirst for revenge affect your fighting prowess.~
@32   = ~You mean, our unknown enemy might have an interest in you?~
@33   = ~Maybe I am just being paranoid. Let us go and find these bandits. Whatever the future holds, it will be revealed in due time.~
@34   = ~Well, it seemed like it... But I don't have an idea why this should be, Ajantis.~
@35   = ~Well... "Hand over your ward and no one will be hurt. If you resist it shall be a waste of your life." That's what the armored figure said when we were attacked. That sure sounds like interest to me, Ajantis.~
@36   = ~If you say so, my lady.~
@37   = ~Be assured: I will fight at your side against these criminals with all my might.~
@38   = ~Let's continue our search and bring justice to the Sword Coast.~
@39   = ~Of course, my lady. I am sorry.~
@40   = ~That is very strange indeed, my lady.~
@41   = ~My lady, I told you I am a squire paladin of the Most Holy Order of the Radiant Heart. May I tell you more about this force of goodness and righteousness?~
@42   = ~Yes, please.~
@43   = ~If you would be so kind, m'lord.~
@44   = ~I know a bit about it myself, Ajantis.~
@45   = ~Ajantis, I am a paladin and I'm fully aware of your noble Order. But thank you anyway for the offer.~
@46   = ~No. I am not interested in your Order.~
@47   = ~Oh, please stop! *In a sarcastic tone* "Force of goodness and righteousness"... that's more than I can stand. If that's the way you talk, it would be best to continue our journey in silence.~
@48   = ~Really? I am delighted. How much do you know?~
@49   = ~I know the Order of the Radiant Heart is a distinguished association of honorable, lawful knights and paladins.~
@50   = ~Not much, really. You can tell me more, if you wish.~
@51   = ~Ajantis, I am a paladin, and I know everything there is to know of this noble Order.~
@52   = ~Enough to know that I don't want to hear anything further.~
@53   = ~You heard the truth, my lady. It is a very powerful Order. Many virtuous men and women combine their forces to fight evil and help the weak and poor across Faerun.~
@54   = ~Sounds very impressive, Ajantis. I believe you are doing a lot of good.~
@55   = ~Tell me more about the Order, Ajantis.~
@56   = ~Evil? How do you know that someone is evil, Ajantis?~
@57   = ~I don't like Orders of this kind, Ajantis. They just seem to be another way for paladins to parade their importance, which shows even more of their arrogance.~
@58   = ~That's nice, Ajantis. Let's move on.~
@59   = ~The Order is an association of lawful knights and paladins. It is a very powerful Order, my lady. Many virtuous men and women combine their forces to fight evil and help the weak and poor across Faerun.~
@60   = ~Evil? How do you know someone is evil, Ajantis?~
@61   = ~I think I know enough now, Ajantis. Let's move on.~
@62   = ~As I said, I am a squire paladin. I must prove myself, before I can be knighted. Once knighted, it will still be a long journey, but my ultimate goal is to become a full-fledged member of the Order, one day.~
@63   = ~Then I will not bore you with the details, my lady.~
@64   = ~It is our humble desire, my lady. We are all ready to give our lives for honor and righteousness.~
@65   = ~"Arrogance"? Is that your opinion of paladins?~
@66   = ~Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. I just don't like paladins in general, that's all.~
@67   = ~Well, up to now, yes. But you're different... *grins*~
@68   = ~Sure, just look at yourself.~
@69   = ~I beg your pardon?~
@70   = ~Well, you have to admit that despite your youth, you already have a strong opinion as to what is right or wrong. There are never any gray areas with you. In truth, life is not always so simple. This attitude makes you seem a bit arrogant.~
@71   = ~You are young and inexperienced, yet you act with the stubbornness and arrogance that only self-righteous paladins have.~
@72   = ~I am happy to hear that, but no paladin deserves your disdain.~
@73   = ~I am sorry, my lady, I seem to bore you with my conversation.~
@74   = ~No, it's all right. Tell me what you know, Ajantis.~
@75   = ~I didn't mean it like that, Ajantis. I just don't want to talk about the Order of the Radiant Heart, that's all.~
@76   = ~Indeed. I would appreciate it if you would limit our discussion to the task at hand, Ajantis.~
@77   = ~Do not mistake our sense of duty for arrogance, my lady. We, paladins, are only human, fighting in the name of honor and righteousness. We confront evil wherever we see it, ready to give our lives, if need be.~
@78   = ~If my behavior disturbs you that much, I will keep my thoughts to myself in the future. In Helm's name, I hope you show more tact with your actions than with your words. Let's continue with our duty.~
@79   = ~I hope I can convince you to change your opinion during our travels together.~
@80   = ~Please forgive my harsh words. I didn't mean to offend you. Of course I am interested in getting to know you better. Maybe my preconceptions about paladins are unjustified.~
@81   = ~We will see, Ajantis.~
@82   = ~I'm not interested, Ajantis. Best if you stay silent for the rest of our journey.~
@83   = ~Evil? How do you know what is evil, Ajantis?~
@84   = ~I am happy to hear that, lady <CHARNAME>.~
@85   = ~Any paladin or goodly fighter who strives to uphold just laws, can become a knight, despite his or her origin. Would you be interested in becoming a knight of the Order of the Most Radiant Heart?~
@86   = ~Maybe.~
@87   = ~I don't think so, Ajantis.~
@88   = ~Then let me tell you more about how it is organized.~
@89   = ~A quarter consists of twenty-five members, chosen from the bravest and wisest paladins, with three prelates at the head. They are assisted by younger knights and squires, who have not yet gained the age or the experience to become full-fledged members.~
@90   = ~These knights and squires are also the ones who execute the field missions for the Order.~
@91   = ~Ah, is this the position you are in right now?~
@92   = ~You mean that these are the poor slobs who do all the work and take all the beatings?~
@93   = ~Ajantis, I think I know enough now.~
@94   = ~Ah, no. I would not say so, my lady. Every member of the Order has already proven his or her fighting prowess sufficiently.~
@95   = ~My lady, if it is your wish, I will remain silent for the rest of our travels. Let us move on now.~
@96   = ~The biggest chapter of the Order is located in the capital city of Amn, Athkatla. That is where my mentor, the highly respected paladin, Sir Keldorn resides.~
@97   = ~Amn?! You are telling me that now? When everything points to a rising war with Amn?~
@98   = ~You've been sent from *Amn*? You told me, you were from Waterdeep!~
@99   = ~Your presence has nothing to do with the current political situation, I hope.~
@100  = ~I was not "sent by Amn", at least not in the way you mean. I do, in fact, hail from Waterdeep. I said that the biggest chapter of the Order is located in Amn.~
@101  = ~The Order does not interfere in politics, lady <CHARNAME>. But we are watching local events with concern, as they are threatening peace in the region.~
@102  = ~The increasing bandit activity here on the Sword Coast is forcing us to interfere. I am here to investigate the situation. With our combined forces, we will find the ones responsible for these evil happenings.~
@103  = ~May I tell you more about how the Order is organized?~
@104  = ~Yes, please continue.~
@105  = ~No, thanks, Ajantis. Let's just get moving.~
@106  = ~Indeed, my lady. I shall stop boring you with further details about the Order of the Radiant Heart. My ultimate goal is to become a full-fledged member of the Order one day. Considering I am squire paladin, it will be a long journey.~
@107  = ~Evil is in lawbreaking and in holding self-interest above the rules that men have agreed upon to enable peaceful coexistence.~
@108  = ~I agree. I believe your Order is doing a lot of good.~
@109  = ~What about the father that steals to feed his hungry child? Is he evil?~
@110  = ~I don't like Orders of this kind, Ajantis. They just seem to be another way for paladins to parade their importance, which shows even more of their arrogance.~
@111  = ~I see, Ajantis. Let's move on.~
@112  = ~His misery is regretful and things have to be changed to give him and his child a better life. His deed is evil, however. He would have to take responsibility for his actions, my lady. Stealing is against law and must be punished, otherwise the land would be reigned by chaos and the will of the strong who would oppress the weak.~
@113  = ~I see what you mean, Ajantis. I believe your Order is doing a lot of good.~
@114  = ~Your answer was swift, but there are a lot of grey-shaded cases where a black and white view will not take you even this far. I hope you are aware of this, you, who professes to fight for the good.~
@115  = ~So you would punish a poor man, who is only trying to care for his child?! I can't believe the cold-heartedness of your words, Ajantis! "Things have to be changed!" Bah. Get off your high horse, rich boy!~
@116  = ~My virtuous friend, could you perhaps explain the difference between a land ruled by the will of the strong and a powerful Order punishing a poor man for breaking a law they support?~
@117  = ~"Cold-heartedness"? You misunderstood my feelings and my words, lady <CHARNAME>. I have the impression that it would be best if I kept my thoughts to myself from now on. We should concentrate on our task, instead of arguing.~
@118  = ~Lady <CHARNAME>! Verily, you have a sharp mind, and a tongue to match it. Its own power is, indeed, the greatest danger to the Order, or so Sir Keldorn had taught me. But I think that our Tenets, our credo, and the noble men that lead us will not let us become a force of evil, masking black deeds with righteous words. We will never rule a country, my lady. We will only help goodly rulers keep the peace and protect the oppressed in the lands of the evil ones!~
@119  = ~Well, let's move on.~
@120  = ~I am here to gain experience, to learn, and to prove myself, my lady. Time will tell whether I am worthy of knighthood.~
@121  = ~Evil is in lawbreaking and holding self-interest above the rules that men have agreed upon to enable peaceful coexistence.~
@122  = ~We will see how you apply your ideals in real life, Ajantis, and whether I will form a better opinion of paladins.~
@123  = ~I'm not interested in getting to know you better, Ajantis. Best if you stay silent for the rest of our journey.~
@124  = ~So you would punish a poor man, who is only trying to care for his child?! I can't believe the cold-heartedness of your words, Ajantis! "Things have to be changed!" Bah. Get off your high horse, rich boy!~
@125  = ~I am here to gain experience, to learn, and to prove myself, my lady. Time will tell whether I am worthy of knighthood.~
@126  = ~Look at all that is happening around us, my lady. People feel nervous and insecure. Many are calling for war. In times like these, it is reassuring to have a god you can put your faith in. I am very thankful to have Helm as a solid, steady source of power I can rely on.~
@127  = ~Yes, indeed. I'm sure you noticed that I rely on Helm, just like you do.~
@128  = ~I feel the same, however my god is not Helm.~
@129  = ~I don't feel like that at all, Ajantis. I don't need a god.~
@130  = ~I don't want to talk about gods, Ajantis.~
@131  = ~Of course, I noticed your devotion to Helm, my lady.~
@132  = ~I would like to talk about Helm with you, Ajantis. Tell me about the Vigilant One.~
@133  = ~Well, we are both Helm's devotees so there's no need to talk more about him.~
@134  = ~With pleasure, my lady.~
@135  = ~What do you know about Helm, my lady?~
@136  = ~Well, not much, to be honest.~
@137  = ~He is the god of duty and vigilance.~
@138  = ~The only thing I know is that he let people down during the Time of Troubles.~
@139  = ~I don't want to talk about your god, Ajantis.~
@140  = ~But he didn't!~
@141  = ~Helm, the Vigilant One, is the god of duty, vigilance, and protection. He is the eternal sentry, the ever watchful, the protector never distracted from his duty. His symbol is the staring eye with a blue pupil on an upright war gauntlet.~
@142  = ~That's true, my lady. Helm is the eternal sentry, the ever watchful, the protector never distracted from his duty. His symbol is the staring eye with a blue pupil on an upright war gauntlet.~
@143  = ~Helm is neither cold nor emotionless. He dedicates himself to his appointed task with stern discipline, but he is fond of children, my lady. They are the only ones with whom he is tolerant if they offend his rules.~
@144  = ~Please continue, Ajantis.~
@145  = ~I think I know enough already, Ajantis.~
@146  = ~Helm's rules are: Never betray those who trust you. Be vigilant. Be fair and diligent in the conduct of your orders. Protect the weak, poor, injured, and young; do not sacrifice them for others or for yourself. Always obey orders, providing that those orders follow the rules of Helm. Demonstrate excellence and loyalty in your role as a guardian and protector.~
@147  = ~We Helmite clergy and followers are always vigilant and prepared for attack from our enemies. We never act on an impulse, as careful planning has proven to be better in the end. We defend the weak and young, and never betray our duty.~
@148  = ~Duty to one's cause outweighs all.~ [%tutu_var%AJANT24]
@149  = ~During the Time of Troubles, the gods wandered as mortal avatars on Faerun, and Helm was the only deity that retained his godly powers. His role was to confine the other deities to Faerun, and he served in this task faultlessly. Nevertheless, the avatars caused much destruction, and people blamed Helm for it.~
@150  = ~Yes, the latter is true, and it's the reason for the decline in the influence of the church of Helm.~
@151  = ~Thanks for this information, Ajantis.~
@152  = ~Some say Helm let people down during the Time of Troubles, Ajantis.~
@153  = ~You forgot to mention that he murdered Mystra during the Time of Troubles.~
@154  = ~I don't know. Your sermon didn't bring me closer to your god.~
@155  = ~Enough of this! I don't want to hear any more about your 'oh so great' god.~
@156  = ~During the Time of Troubles, Helm did nothing but his duty, my lady.~
@157  = ~Sure. I admire Helm for his firmness.~
@158  = ~Still I have a different opinion.~
@159  = ~I know, Ajantis. I worship Helm as you do, but it's always wise to look at history with an open and critical mind.~
@160  = ~Your babbling about Helm is tiresome! I won't listen any more.~
@161  = ~My lady, your claim is wrong. Allow me to prove it.~
@162  = ~Murder?~
@163  = ~Are you so sure, my lady? What powers your body and soul in the never-ending battle that is our life?~
@164  = ~Well, the assistance of loyal fighting comrades, for example. *smile*~
@165  = ~It doesn't matter. Tell me about your god, if you wish.~
@166  = ~Stop it. I don't need your sarcasm, I didn't choose to be here!~
@167  = ~Let's stop this discourse, Ajantis. I have the impression that it is going nowhere.~
@168  = ~I beg your forgiveness, lady <CHARNAME>. It was not my intent to offend you. I was absolutely serious in posing that question. I cannot imagine my life without humble devotion to my god.~
@169  = ~And that's exactly what I don't need. Let's stop this conversation right now. It's not going anywhere.~
@170  = ~Well, I prefer relying on those that are nearby... my fighting comrades, for example. *smile*~
@171  = ~Then tell me about your god, Ajantis.~
@172  = ~It's all right, but I don't want to talk about it. Let's move on.~
@173  = ~Then I will bother you no longer, my lady.~
@174  = ~It was a pleasure. My lady, I am happy that we are of the same faith. Let us go on with our quest and fight the bandits in Helm's name!~
@175  = ~My lady, I am happy that we are of the same faith. Let us go on with our quest and fight the bandits in Helm's name!~
@176  = ~It was a pleasure. Let us go on with our quest and fight the bandits.~
@177  = ~That's true. But people will find their way back to Helm's virtues.~
@178  = ~That is regrettable, my lady, but I fear I cannot change it right now. Maybe you will reach a different opinion during the course of our travels.~
@179  = ~My lady, I recommend that you choose your words with great care while talking about the Vigilant One. I will not tolerate an insult to his name!~
@180  = ~I shall not bore you with my thoughts again.~
@181  = ~...Who are fighting loyally at your side, lady <CHARNAME>. Yet I think you will see the truth of my words one day.~
@182  = ~Maybe. Tell me about your god.~
@183  = ~We will see, Ajantis. Now let's move on.~
@184  = ~That is what he is indeed. My lady, I am happy that we are of the same faith. Let us go on with our quest and fight the bandits in Helm's name!~
@185  = ~But he did not!~
@186  = ~That is what he is indeed, my lady. Let us go on and fight the bandits in Helm's name!~
@187  = ~Lady <CHARNAME>, we have combined our forces to bring criminals to justice. I have seen you fighting and I know how you have treated our enemies so far.~
@188  = ~But what will you do once we face the mastermind, the one responsible for all the evil goings-on, maybe even the murderer of your foster father Gorion?~
@189  = ~Ajantis, that question is not easy to answer. I don't want to be driven by hatred and vengeance, yet I want to see this fiend punished for his evil deeds. He has to feel the strong hand of justice!~
@190  = ~It will depend on *his* behavior, Ajantis. If he forces us to fight, I'll kill him with satisfaction.~
@191  = ~What a question! As if there any choice but to kill them all. They are responsible for the evil things going on around us!~
@192  = ~Ajantis, I'm not doing this because I seek justice of revenge. I just want the assassins to stop coming after me so that I have a chance to lead a normal life again.~
@193  = ~It depends on his behavior, Ajantis, but I could imagine being ready to forgive him, if he is repentant.~
@194  = ~Yes, you saw me fighting. So you know that I'm going to kill him no matter what. Why do you ask?~
@195  = ~This is a good approach, my lady, and a righteous one. I commend you for that.~
@196  = ~We will fight them until they are beaten and lie broken at our feet. But should those evil doers surrender, I will help you to bring them to a proper court of law. There they will feel the power of justice!~
@197  = ~So it is mostly self-interest that drives you? Understandable self-interest, I have to admit. In a way that is my motivation, too. I want people to be free of bandit depredations!~
@198  = ~I commend your desire to see the wrong-doers punished, but it does not mean we have to slaughter them!~
@199  = ~My lady, your words reveal that you take pleasure in killing. This is unacceptable.~
@200  = ~Pleasure in killing? I'm just saying aloud what everyone else is thinking. These vermin have no right to live. They must be destroyed if there is to be peace on the Sword Coast.~
@201  = ~No, Ajantis, you get me wrong. I don't take pleasure in killing. Yet, my experience, however limited, tells me that our foes won't surrender. They will fight to the death.~
@202  = ~Unacceptable? Maybe. But I can't imagine why these vermin should live.~
@203  = ~That is not a sure thing, my lady. There have been great warriors who pleaded for their lives in the face of death.~
@204  = ~Forgive me, but I do not know whom you want to convince, yourself or me. Your deeds do not reflect your words, at least not what I have seen so far.~
@205  = ~Let us continue our journey. Our thoughts should be focused on the important task we perform. There will be no time for idle talk from now on.~
@206  = ~You would kill a helpless enemy?~
@207  = ~What?! You are the paladin. It's *you* who's talking about destroying evil all the time!~
@208  = ~Without hesitation. You should do the same. It will help you fulfill your grand plan.~
@209  = ~Evil must be purged without mercy. That is what my every instinct tells me, my lady.~ [%tutu_var%AJANT26]
@210  = ~But "without mercy" doesn't mean cruel, or without justice. Helm says: "Do not sacrifice the weak to your own good." I would not slaughter an evil creature lying defenseless at my feet, but bring him to a proper court of law. There, the villain would have to take responsibility for his actions - and would be judged without false mercy.~
@211  = ~That's nonsense. I will get rid of any foe attacking me - in the only *final* way there is.~
@212  = ~Hm, there's some truth in what you are saying here.~
@213  = ~I cannot bear any more remarks of that kind. Let us continue our search - in silence, from now on.~
@214  = ~I swear by my honor! And if I say honor, lady <CHARNAME>, then remember: My honor is my life!~ [%tutu_var%AJANT17]
@215  = ~Indeed. You are a man of honor, Ajantis. I appreciate your presence in my war-party.~
@216  = ~I feel the same, Ajantis.~
@217  = ~That's good for you, Ajantis.~
@218  = ~I am happy to hear that, my lady.~
@219  = ~Thank you for the compliment, my lady. I am very happy we met... and combined our forces.~
@220  = ~What a selfless approach, my lady. However, we should not forget that these bandits are spreading evil. I think that they will not surrender without a fight. And I am definitely sure that they will not repent!~
@221  = ~Either way, if we have to fight them, we will do so until they are beaten. Should the villains surrender, I will help you bring them to a proper court of law. There they will feel the power of justice!~
@222  = ~Your words give me hope that you will let these virtuous goals direct your future actions.~
@223  = ~Tell me: What do honor and justice mean to you?~
@224  = ~As I said before, my honor is my life. I would never betray those who trust me.~
@225  = ~My honor is my life, too. I would never betray those who trust me.~
@226  = ~Honor is a very flexible term, Ajantis. There have been decent men accused of dishonest behavior because people didn't know the whole story!~
@227  = ~Honor is a lie invented  by evil, power-obsessed people to stall noble fools like you! It's easier to get ahead if ideals and principles are ignored from time to time.~
@228  = ~"Honor"? Not in my dictionary! This is growing tiresome.~
@229  = ~And justice?~
@230  = ~For me, a world without it is unthinkable. It is my endeavor to bring justice to the people. Without it, the world would be ruled by anarchy.~
@231  = ~I'm not sure, Ajantis... To me, justice is like a myth - I don't see that it truly exists.~
@232  = ~Whatever helps me reach my goals is just and fair. That wasn't the answer you expected to hear, was it?~
@233  = ~My lady, in you I have found a like-minded comrade. I'm proud to fight by your side.~
@234  = ~My lady, by your words, you are a like-minded comrade. Let us hope your future actions will speak the same language!~
@235  = ~My lady, please forgive my saying this, but considering your profession, it is impossible to believe you claim honor and righteousness as your own.~
@236  = ~You mean because I'm a thief?! Do you think I am not a woman of honor just because I'm a thief?! Ajantis, we've spent some time together and you've seen me working. Haven't you noticed that I only use my talents to *avoid* fights and to solve conflicts without bloodshed?!~
@237  = ~No surprise, Ajantis - I *am* a thief, and I have no interest in living the way you do.~
@238  = ~There is honor among thieves, Ajantis. Have you never heard this? Ah, what's the point? You will denounce anyone who exercises a different code of honor than you as a wretch, to be pitied at best or to be hanged in a market square at worst.~
@239  = ~I noticed, my lady, and I respect your attempts, and yet... *takes a deep breath*~
@240  = ~Let us move on, and avoid idle talk like this in the future. There are many duties we must attend to.~
@241  = ~These are proud words, my lady, but I do not see them reflected in your actions.~
@242  = ~At least you are admitting it. Let us move on, my lady, and avoid idle talk like this in the future. There are many duties we must attend to.~
@243  = ~Let us move on and carry out our duty.~
@244  = ~But it *is* there! Strengthen your belief in honor, lady <CHARNAME>, because with honor comes justice. Let us strike onward and bring it to the people, and you will see that it is not a myth!~
@245  = ~Still you would not lose your honor - before your god and yourself.~
@246  = ~If you put it like that - honor is important for me, too. I would never betray those who trust me.~
@247  = ~Ajantis, Honor is a lie invented  by evil, power-obsessed people to stall noble fools like you! It's easier to get ahead if ideals and principles are ignored from time to time.~
@248  = ~No! You did not understand a word I said.~
@249  = ~Are you ridiculing me? Do you hold disdain for what I have said?~
@250  = ~I would give my life if I could destroy all evil around us with one stroke of my sword. Haven't you felt that way, sometimes?~
@251  = ~It's a shame to see the grievous things that happen around us, Ajantis. I know what you mean.~
@252  = ~Ajantis! I've never seen you in such a mood! What happened to your belief in the righteous path you are treading?~
@253  = ~Maybe you *can* stop evil with one stroke. The only problem is to find out *where* that would be. And that would be one very *big* swing! Just imagine all it would have to hit.~
@254  = ~No! Don't lose yourself in such thoughts! Better to concentrate on fighting!~
@255  = ~Why do you paladins always preach that evil equals bad? What's wrong, for example, with a measure of selfishness?~
@256  = ~Well, you could combine both parts of that wish, Ajantis. Fall on your sword, and then I won't have to listen to your sermons any more.~
@257  = ~Ye gods, and I thought Tiax was the only megalomaniac in our company. I hope that it's not contagious, or, at the very least, that I will not succumb to such childish delusions of omnipotence.~
@258  = ~Indeed, my lady. All this sorrow... I know it is a pointless thought, impossible to realize. I only wished to put into words the feelings that overwhelm me when I look at people's misery.~
@259  = ~I have not lost my faith, my lady. I know it is a pointless thought, impossible to realize. I only wished to put into words the feelings that overwhelm me when I look at people's misery.~
@260  = ~Do not make fun of me, my lady. I know it is a pointless thought, impossible to realize. I only wished to put into words the feelings that overwhelm me when I look at people's misery.~
@261  = ~You are right! Let us continue and contribute to the battle against evil!~
@262  = ~I became a paladin to stand against the evil that poisons our world. In this battle, every contribution counts. Every good act, even the smallest one, leads the world on the path of righteousness!~
@263  = ~But, the more I see, the more experience I gain, the clearer it becomes to me that it is an endless conflict... For every wrong-doer I destroy, for every enemy I beat, there are new ones!~
@264  = ~Don't give up, Ajantis! Up to now, it's not been clear which side will win. Just because *you* can't see the end doesn't mean there won't be one!~
@265  = ~Good gracious, what are you whining about? Where is your fighting spirit, your humble acceptance of the fate you've chosen for yourself?~
@266  = ~Ah, at last you noticed something of the real world. The one where we, to whom destiny didn't give a cozy childhood, dwell?~
@267  = ~And it will be like this for the rest of your life. Didn't your mentors prepare you for this?~
@268  = ~So it is. Hence, let us continue fighting. Talking about it won't lead us anywhere.~
@269  = ~Ajantis, why do you think that a little bit of evil is so... well, evil? What is wrong with using one's opportunities, for example?~
@270  = ~My lady? I did not know that you had such a low opinion of me!~
@271  = ~Ajantis, that was a joke. A bad one, I admit. I'm sorry. What I meant was that I can't stand this kind of talk. We will be facing dangerous enemies soon, and I'll need you to be strong and unwavering. Brace yourself, pray to your god, and let's go on!~
@272  = ~Good gracious, you take things so seriously. That was only a joke, now calm down.~
@273  = ~Let's just move on, shall we?~
@274  = ~Lady <CHARNAME>, for you this might have been a jest, but if this is your way of joking, I would rather stop sharing my thoughts with you.~
@275  = ~That is all you have to say? If this is your way of joking I would rather stop sharing my thoughts with you.~
@276  = ~Maybe that is the best answer. Evil can only be purged with courage and determination!~
@277  = ~My lady - you do not mean this seriously!~
@278  = ~I didn't say it's my opinion, Ajantis. It's only that I see a lot of 'evil' men and women reaching their goals, while a lot of 'good' ones stumble and fall.~
@279  = ~Yes, I do, Ajantis. Evil people use the chances provided to them and do not worry about the wellbeing of others. They aren't devoted to a "righteous task," nor have moral scruples. They care only for themselves and they are always right. And that's how they succeed.~
@280  = ~My lady, you are saying this as if you value evil above good. I cannot stand such talk!~
@281  = ~I cannot believe you are saying this, my lady. Your deeds defy your words, yet you've spoken seriously just now, betraying the darkness of your heart. I cannot stand such talk!~
@282  = ~Let me only say one more thing, before I close my mouth for the rest of our travels.~
@283  = ~Do not underestimate the suffering brought upon the nations by shortsighted selfishness! What could be more contemptible than plunging others into sorrow and misery for the sake of self-elevation! If evil ruled the world, there would be no more mercy, no ideals, no justice! If evil ruled the world it would turn into chaos, into the Demon Pits!~
@284  = ~Now that I know your heart, I will watch your steps carefully. Let us move on.~
@285  = ~That is only true at first sight, lady <CHARNAME>. It is up to us to make sure that this does not happen!~
@286  = ~I agree with you on that. But reality depresses me sometimes.~
@287  = ~It's Okay, Ajantis. I said it's not *my* opinion.~
@288  = ~I don't agree with you at all, Ajantis!~
@289  = ~Your words ring true and comfort me. I thank you.~
@290  = ~You are right to choose harsh words. I was lost in my thoughts.~
@291  = ~Your words are as sharp as daggers, but I see what you mean.~
@292  = ~Of course they did, my lady - with all their wisdom and experience.~
@293  = ~I have lost neither my faith nor my motivation, lady <CHARNAME>. I only wanted to share my thoughts with you and thank you for your time.~
@294  = ~How is it you became paladin, Ajantis?~
@295  = ~That's good. Now let's move on. There are many things to do!~
@296  = ~I was...filled with this desire, for lack of another term, my lady. Helm has held sway over my heart since the first moment I beheld his glory, and it is in His name that I do good. There is simply no other way for me to be.~
@297  = ~I studied diligently at the church of Helm and practiced my swordsmanship. One of my teachers was Myrmith Splendon, of whom you might have heard. One day, I had a dream: Helm spoke to me and told me that I was worthy to serve him.~
@298  = ~I went directly to the local chapter of the Order of the Most Radiant Heart, and now I am here.~
@299  = ~I envy you, Ajantis, in a good way. Such a straight path. It seems you found your place, once and for all, and I'm sure you will succeed.~
@300  = ~Indeed. Then let's move on and use our skills in the fight against our enemies!~
@301  = ~Hmm, you paladins are strange. Let's return to our campaign, Ajantis. Our enemies don't waste time bantering about good and evil, I am sure of that.~
@302  = ~That is my desire, lady <CHARNAME>. Let us get back to our duties!~
@303  = ~You must have ideals you are living and fighting for, my lady. Everybody does. But you are right - it is time for us to resume our journey.~
@304  = ~I understand very well, my lady.~
@305  = ~My lady! Are you closing your eyes to the obvious?!~
@306  = ~No, and I made this very observation: The evil reach their goals and the good fail because of their sincerity.~
@307  = ~Oh, calm down!~
@308  = ~My lady, you are saying this as if you value evil above good. I cannot stand such talk! I will keep my thoughts to myself from now on!~
@309  = ~I am a paladin and a humble devotee of Helm. Your words are an affront to all my values!~
@310  = ~I thank you, my lady. That is my desire. Let us return to our duties then!~
@311  = ~My lady, you may recall that I am from Waterdeep. Maybe our travels along the Sword Coast will lead us there one day. Have you ever been to the City of Splendors?~
@312  = ~No, but please tell me about it.~
@313  = ~Yes, but it's been a while.~
@314  = ~I don't want to talk about Waterdeep, Ajantis.~
@315  = ~You have already been there? I am glad to hear that, lady <CHARNAME>. Then I guess you understand my fondness of that vibrant city.~
@316  = ~Oh yes. All the activity! Tell me more about Waterdeep, Ajantis.~
@317  = ~No, not really. I can't imagine wanting to live in such a big city.~
@318  = ~Oh, does that mean you did not like it? I am sorry to hear that. May I tell you about Waterdeep nonetheless?~
@319  = ~Sure, why not.~
@320  = ~No, not really. I think I know enough about it already.~
@321  = ~Waterdeep lies to the North of Baldur's Gate, on the Sword Coast.  It is surrounded by the Sword Mountains to the North, by the Ardeep Forest to the East, and to the South by the Kryptgarden Forest and the River Dessarin, which flows into the sea south of the city boundaries. It's one of the biggest cities in Faerun, a cosmopolitan power, characterized by an open, tolerant spirit.~
@322  = ~Mount Waterdeep, the highest point of the city, with the Castle Waterdeep upon it, is to the West. The Trollwall surrounds the city on its East and North. To the South lies the great harbor.~
@323  = ~We Waterdhavians call it the City of Splendors, and it surely is, my lady. It is an important center of trade, and through trade, the townsfolk gained their wealth.~
@324  = ~Please go on, Ajantis.~
@325  = ~Well, I think that's enough of an introduction for me. Thank you, Ajantis.~
@326  = ~The city is ruled by the Lords of Waterdeep, a council of sixteen members who keep their identities secret. The Lords only appear in public wearing masks, and are magically protected. There is only one unmasked Lord: Piergeiron the Paladinson, Warden of Waterdeep and Commander of the Watch. He is called the Open Lord of Waterdeep.~
@327  = ~Masked Lords that rule the city? That sounds weird.~
@328  = ~Yes, I know that. I think you told me enough about Waterdeep.~
@329  = ~This system of governing has its roots in Waterdhavian history, my lady. Do you mind if I tell you about it?~
@330  = ~No, I'm all ears.~
@331  = ~Well, I'd prefer if you didn't. Better we stay with the present.~
@332  = ~In earlier days, the north was a wild land, almost unsettled by humans. Only a few primitive tribes lived along the Sword Coast, ruled by warlords. Early Waterdeep was a human settlement, and they used the great natural deepwater bay as harbor for their town.~
@333  = ~At this time, and for an age afterwards, many battles were fought. Orcs, trolls and other fell beasts threatened the human settlements. It was around 950 in Dale Reckoning, that a mage called Ahghairon became special advisor to Waterdeep's Warlord of that time. It was Ahghairon's magic that led to a great victory over the assailants.~
@334  = ~Ahghairon stopped the Warlord from founding a brutal Northern empire and became the first Lord of Waterdeep. He recruited others to rule the city with him, the Masked Lords. They wore masks in public, to keep their identity secret.~
@335  = ~From that time on we have had a different way of counting the years than elsewhere in the North. It is called Northreckoning, and it starts with Ahghairon becoming the first Open Lord of Waterdeep. In Dale Reckoning, this would be the year 1032.~
@336  = ~Once, the Guild masters took over the city by brutally killing the majority of the Lords. It has only been ninety-five years since the surviving Lords beat them back. Waterdeep has been guided by their collective will ever since.~
@337  = ~The city is divided into seven Wards. Each of the wards has its own unique style. Naturally, they attract different sorts of people...~
@338  = ~The Waterdhavians are a mixture of different races, but most are human. Every day new people come, seeking their fortune, and only few ever leave again.~
@339  = ~*smile* I can see that you love your home, Ajantis. That was quite a vivid description. I can almost see Waterdeep.~
@340  = ~Sounds like a city with a lot of possibilities. Maybe I should go there... if this quest ever ends.~
@341  = ~I don't know. It's just not my type of city: too big, too crowded.~
@342  = ~As you wish, my lady.~
@343  = ~I am indeed attached to Waterdeep, my lady.~
@344  = ~I am sure it would be worthwhile, my lady.~
@345  = ~It is a pity, but that's your opinion.~
@346  = ~Tell me about your home, lady <CHARNAME>. You grew up in Candlekeep?~
@347  = ~I did indeed, surrounded by old monks and dusty books...~
@348  = ~Oh yes, Ajantis, that huge library was my home. Not a vast metropolis, like Waterdeep, but I had access to the entire world and many worlds beyond, albeit all on paper.~
@349  = ~Yes, a small town, compared to Waterdeep.~
@350  = ~Yes, that's right, but I don't want to talk about it.~
@351  = ~Candlekeep must be a fascinating place! All of that wisdom and knowledge collected through the years in the magnificent library! I assume you spent a lot of your time reading?~
@352  = ~Yes, I did. Reading means a lot to me, and I am very sorry I don't have the time for it any more. I miss the quietness and seclusion of the library and all the books.~
@353  = ~Oh yes, Ajantis. The knowledge I gained by doing so has helped me a great deal.~
@354  = ~From time to time. Even in Candlekeep people live normal lives, you know.~
@355  = ~Well... no, not really. I preferred to roam the countryside... I reckon it was a good preparation for my life now.~
@356  = ~I envy you. I had good access to books myself, but Candlekeep's library is unique in its greatness.~
@357  = ~There's not much to say about the rest of the town though. Like everywhere else, there's barracks, houses and a tavern; everything is rather small.~
@358  = ~Indeed. Reading means a lot to me, and I am very sorry I don't have the time for it any more. I miss the quietness and seclusion of the library and all the books.~
@359  = ~I believe you do. It is always advisable to gain knowledge.~
@360  = ~Of course, my lady. I did not mean to offend you with what I said.~
@361  = ~Ah? I agree wholeheartedly, lady <CHARNAME>. Practice is very important.~
@362  = ~I will bother you no longer then, my lady, even if your childhood interests me.~
@363  = ~I have never been to Candlekeep, my lady, but I would like to see it. Maybe our travels will lead us there, who knows? Let us move on.~
@364  = ~Lady <CHARNAME>, we talked about Waterdeep, and you know that my family lives there. I feel very attached to my parents. I would like to tell you more about my family, if you are interested.~
@365  = ~Yes, please, Ajantis.~
@366  = ~Well, if you want to.~
@367  = ~Indeed! You send them letters, right? I saw you writing last time we set camp.~
@368  = ~Ajantis, there's no need for all this talking. Let's concentrate on our quest, okay?~
@369  = ~Ajantis, all this talking is getting on my nerves. There are more important things we have to do. Let's concentrate on our quest!~
@370  = ~I am sorry, but I don't want to talk about your family.~
@371  = ~Oh? That is true. But I do not let myself get distracted from my duties, lady <CHARNAME>. It is only that they ask to be kept informed of my wellbeing and whereabouts, from time to time.~
@372  = ~That is perfectly all right, Ajantis. Is there... someone else you are writing letters to on a regular basis?~
@373  = ~Ah, don't mind me. Tell me about your family.~
@374  = ~That's a bit weird, you know... A man your age shouldn't be such a momma's boy.~
@375  = ~To my grandmother, but, alas, not as often as I should. She is quite old, a very kind and sensitive person.~
@376  = ~Oh, that's nice. Okay, then tell me more about your family, Ajantis.~
@377  = ~*grin* All right. Forget it. You wanted to tell me about your immediate family.~
@378  = ~Good gracious, it's getting worse. You would think a man your age would not be such a momma's boy anymore!~
@379  = ~My lady! I... did not have the impression our conversations were disturbing you that much!~
@380  = ~They don't. I only thought that it's a bad time to chat. But okay, tell me about your family.~
@381  = ~I am sorry, but I don't want to hear about your family, Ajantis.~
@382  = ~Yes, but there's a time for everything, Ajantis. You are talking too much for my taste. Just concentrate on your duties.~
@383  = ~It is true, that you have shown no great interest in our conversations so far, my lady. I shall keep my thoughts to myself from now on, if that is your wish.~
@384  = ~No, that wasn't the way I meant it, Ajantis. Go on and tell me about your family, please.~
@385  = ~I am sorry, but I don't want to talk about your family, Ajantis.~
@386  = ~Good. Now since that is settled we can move on.~
@387  = ~Indeed. Well, then let us move on, in Helm's name!~
@388  = ~My closest of kin are my parents, Ulguth and Mara, a brother Gotom, and a sister Elina. I am the youngest of four. I had an older brother, Envin, but he died from a disease when I was five.~
@389  = ~Oh! I'm very sorry to hear that, Ajantis.~
@390  = ~I'm terribly sorry to hear that, Ajantis. I think that I have to... apologize in some way. I always thought your childhood was cozy and unspoiled by anything. I can see now that this is not true.~
@391  = ~That's how life goes.~
@392  = ~You do not have to apologize, lady <CHARNAME>. I guess everyone has more to them than can be gleaned at first sight.~
@393  = ~*smile* Which he already did. He and his wife Sinna are expecting their second child.~
@394  = ~You're an *uncle*? Now that's a surprise!~
@395  = ~Oh, how sweet. I wish them all well.~
@396  = ~Congratulations. But tell me, Ajantis - did the death of your eldest brother influence your decision to become a paladin?~
@397  = ~Why is this such a surprise? I did not have anything to do with that happy occasion - I mean... *reddens*~
@398  = ~I wish them well from the bottom of my heart. Sinna is such a nice person, I like her and my nephew very much.~
@399  = ~It's always nice when someone talks so positively about his kin. But a thought just crossed my mind: did the death of your eldest brother influence your decision to become a paladin?~
@400  = ~That's great, Ajantis. I think we should move on now.~
@401  = ~No, my lady, I do not think that there is a connection. Envin died of a natural illness, not because it was ordained by an evil power. But that the memory of his suffering might have strengthened my resolution is an interesting thought. I have to admit I never thought about that, as I have never searched for any 'reasons' for my desire to become a paladin.~
@402  = ~I've chosen a different path than my parents and my siblings. The Ilvastarrs are not known for their fighting skills.~
@403  = ~Would you take a look at my family shield, lady <CHARNAME>? This is our coat of arms: A dragon with a metallic green body and orange eyes on a golden field. You might think that this belonged to a proud knight's family, and was made to terrify Ilvastarrs' foes in battle. And yet it is the result of the artistic aspirations of my great-grandfather.~
@404  = ~Would you take a look at my family coat of arms here on my surcoat: A dragon with a metallic green body and orange eyes on a golden field. You might think that this belonged to a proud knight's family, and was made to terrify Ilvastarrs' foes in battle. And yet it is the result of the artistic aspirations of my great-grandfather.~
@405  = ~My great-grandfather was a remarkable man, my lady. Rumor even has it that he was one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep.~
@406  = ~He became tired of the arrogance and narrow-mindedness of the nobles, who care for nothing but their own desires.~
@407  = ~He opened his house to various intellectual and artistic ideas, trying to learn and understand this world as much as he could.~
@408  = ~That influenced the style of the Ilvastarr family very much, lady <CHARNAME>. My parents are in contact with the artists of Waterdeep, and from far away. They often have learned men as guests in our house. Even when I was young, I liked to listen to their discussions.~
@409  = ~That sounds familiar! That's how it was when I was small. Yes, I can imagine you liked that!~
@410  = ~You listened to intellectual conversations? I always thought, that besides Helm and your fight against evil, there was nothing that interested you.~
@411  = ~And yet you are a member of a snobbish, noble family, pampered by status and wealth. For all your trying to present your family as tolerant and open-minded, I don't have much sympathy for it.~
@412  = ~Indeed. I could imagine you had many chances to listen to fascinating conversations in the high halls of Candlekeep library.~
@413  = ~You mock me, lady <CHARNAME>. My study at the church of Helm and the military training did consume most of my time. And yet, this is not a contradiction to what I have said.~
@414  = ~Ilvastarrs are not just benefactors of arts, of course. We are a merchant family, and my father is a hard working trader. He specializes in beast-taming and breeding, which is done mostly on our country estate south of the city.~
@415  = ~My mother assists him there, and she has a special hobby. Some of the beasts are meant for slaughtering, and mama is a very fine cook of exotic meats. She has won prizes with her recipes.~
@416  = ~Cooking! No wonder the meals are so tasty when it's your turn to cook! You obviously had a good teacher.~
@417  = ~Aha. Well, let's move on then, Ajantis.~
@418  = ~'Cooking of exotic meats'! Good gracious, if rich people have nothing to do, they'll think of anything.~
@419  = ~That was very kind of you to say, my lady. This is all I wanted to tell you about my family... for now. Perhaps we should rejoin our companions.~
@420  = ~You are full of prejudice! Do not talk like this of my family. As if... as if you think we are lazybones and that the money comes flying down our chimney.~
@421  = ~Good lords, just because I say something a bit provocative doesn't mean you have to react like this!~
@422  = ~I didn't intend to sound so unfriendly, Ajantis. I'm sorry.~
@423  = ~Do not talk like this of my family. As if... as if you think we are lazybones and that the money comes flying down our chimney.~
@424  = ~A lot of families would be happy to have meat on their plates at all, Ajantis!~
@425  = ~My lady, it might have been a joke, but if this is your way of jesting, I would rather stop sharing my thoughts with you.~
@426  = ~I am well aware of the fact that my childhood was happier than that of many others, lady <CHARNAME>.~
@427  = ~I live and fight to improve this deplorable state of affairs. What more can I do?~
@428  = ~You are right, Ajantis, I'm sorry. It's wrong to berate somebody because of what he was born into. It's only that what you're telling about your family, in my ears, sounds like a fairytale.~
@429  = ~Wake up! Open your eyes and see! A lot of people struggle for their survival - because they *have* to, not because they had some stupid dream while laying in a bed of eiderdown!~
@430  = ~Yes, yes, now calm down.~
@431  = ~'Momma's boy', my lady? I am saddened that you should think so of me.~
@432  = ~I'm sorry, that wasn't a very nice. What I meant was that you are writing them too many letters. Just be careful that it doesn't get in the way of your duty. But do tell about your family, Ajantis.~
@433  = ~Good gracious, you are overreacting. It was only a joke! Take it easy.~
@434  = ~Ajantis, the Paladin, takes a break from his monumental struggle against evil to sit down and write a letter to his parents every fortnight. Don't you agree that this somehow doesn't... fit?~
@435  = ~As you wish, my lady, although I would have liked to tell you about my family very much. Let us move on and concentrate on our quest.~
@436  = ~Absolutely not, lady <CHARNAME>. These letters express my deep attachment to my parents. I love them, and this love gives me strength for the battle that you were referring to.~
@437  = ~That's admirable. Forgive my words, good Sir, they were inappropriate. Please, tell me more about your family.~
@438  = ~It seems everyone has his or her very own source of strength. I couldn't imagine writing letters as often as you do, but... Well, it doesn't matter. Tell me more about your family, then.~
@439  = ~No, I still can't believe that a man your age could behave in such a way. Grow up, Ajantis!~
@440  = ~My lady, as long as it does not contradict my duties as a paladin, it is my own decision what I do for leisure.~
@441  = ~Spare me your advice in the future. I will keep my thoughts to myself from now on.~
@442  = ~I would like to believe you, lady <CHARNAME>, but I do not think that our conversations are of great interest to you. I will stop this idle banter and keep my thoughts to myself from now on.~
@443  = ~I believe you, lady <CHARNAME>, as I gleaned from our former conversations: you think better of me than this.~
@444  = ~And yet you spoke disparagingly of Ilvastarrs. Please, choose your words with greater care, if you wish to retain my friendship: some words hurt more than the sharpest daggers.~
@445  = ~I cannot believe what I am hearing! Let us stop this. I have the impression it is better if we continue our travels in silence.~
@446  = ~Well then, onward!~
@447  = ~That is all you are going to say about this? I am talking about what is sacred to me, and you tell me to calm down?~
@448  = ~I will keep my thoughts to myself from now on. Now let's go. There is a lot to do.~
@449  = ~It was a very hard time for us all, my lady. The disease tormented him for a long time, and to see him suffering was nearly unbearable. With Envin, we children lost our eldest brother, and our parents lost their firstborn son and heir. Now it is up to Gotom to carry on the Ilvastarr's family traditions.~
@450  = ~You can take this lightly since you were not involved, lady <CHARNAME>. The disease tormented him for a long time, and to see him suffering was nearly unbearable. With Envin, we children lost our eldest brother, and my parents lost their firstborn son and heir. Now it is up to Gotom to carry on the Ilvastarr's family traditions.~
@451  = ~As you wish, my lady. Let us move on and concentrate on our quest!~
@452  = ~My lady, we have talked much of me and my family since we have met. But I would like to learn more about you and your home. I only know that you were born in Candlekeep, and your foster father was brutally murdered.~
@453  = ~Would you like to tell me more about Gorion?~
@454  = ~Yes, of course. He was my father, and a very wise teacher. I miss him a lot!~
@455  = ~Gorion was responsible for the huge library in Candlekeep and a very capable mage, Ajantis.~
@456  = ~Ajantis, I have learned to live with this loss.~
@457  = ~It is very hard for me to talk about Gorion, Ajantis.~
@458  = ~I don't want to talk about Gorion right now, Ajantis. Let us move on.~
@459  = ~Of course. It must have been terrible to see him die without being able to help him.~
@460  = ~It was horrible. Ajantis, I have to find the ones responsible for his death to understand what is going on here.~
@461  = ~You are right, it was awful. I do not want to talk about it.~
@462  = ~Ajantis, don't pity me - help me find the ones responsible for his death.~
@463  = ~I knew that. I had expected a slightly more... personal perspective of him.~
@464  = ~I'm sorry, but it is so hard for me to speak about all this.~
@465  = ~He was my father, Ajantis, and a very wise teacher. I miss him dearly.~
@466  = ~Ajantis, I have come to terms with the situation.~
@467  = ~I wasn't planning on dwelling on personal matters, Ajantis. Please leave me alone.~
@468  = ~Please excuse my prying, lady <CHARNAME>. It is hard for me to find appropriate words as I am not from Candlekeep myself, and cannot even fathom what Gorion's loss means to you.~
@469  = ~That's all right, Ajantis. Thank you for your sympathy.~
@470  = ~*pass your palm over your eyes* How do you console a daughter who'd seen her beloved father slaughtered? Help me find the ones responsible for his murder. It would make his death easier to bear.~
@471  = ~No need for excuses. It is over and cannot be changed.~
@472  = ~Then stop prying, Ajantis. Allow me to keep my private life well... private.~
@473  = ~Do you mean his death, my lady? Or are you referring to Gorion being... your father?~
@474  = ~I meant his death. Horrible things happen all the time - you have to be able to let go. A new part of my life started when he died, and I have come to terms with it.~
@475  = ~I meant Gorion being my "father" as you put it so nicely. I am quite happy to have escaped from his control finally.~
@476  = ~Both, Ajantis. I was never completely happy in Candlekeep. My life has only become better since Gorion's death, and much more interesting. I am quite happy with the way it is now.~
@477  = ~Let's change the subject. I don't want to talk about Gorion anymore.~
@478  = ~I wish I could give you more than my sympathy, my lady. The least I can do is help you find his murderers.~
@479  = ~It is over and cannot be changed you say?~
@480  = ~In a way, I am horrified to hear you say such things. Of course, I cannot expect your relationship with your foster father to have been as close as the one between me and my parents.~
@481  = ~On the other hand, a minimum amount of respect might be expected, considering his recent death. You might appear emotionally uninvolved, but the fact that you are searching for his murderers tells me that you are giving him the respect he deserves.~
@482  = ~Your words are surprising. Have you really overcome the death of your foster father so quickly or are you trying to deceive yourself? You appear detached, but at the same time you pursue his murderers with grim determination. Forgive me for saying what you do not wish to hear, my lady, but I think that you are still involved with what happened.~
@483  = ~I am distressed to hear you speak such words. Of course, I cannot expect your relationship with your foster father to have been as close as that which I have had with my parents. I guess I cannot expect you to have the same fond memories of your childhood as I have.~
@484  = ~Still, I would expect you to show a minimum amount of respect towards him, considering his recent death and the way he died. You appear detached, but at the same time you pursue his murderers with grim determination. This makes me think that you are giving him the respect he deserves.~
@485  = ~Rest assured that I will help you in any way I can, my lady. The further we go, the more I suspect that the death of your foster father is somehow linked to the recent events here on the Sword Coast.~
@486  = ~Forgive me, lady <CHARNAME>. It is not the best subject for a casual chat. Most certainly there must have been more pleasant memories of Candlekeep and your childhood?~
@487  = ~How true. You know, there were many others in Candlekeep that meant much to me.~
@488  = ~I prefer not to chat at this moment, Ajantis.~
@489  = ~Of course there were. Please tell me about them.~
@490  = ~Well, there was Imoen... We grew up together like sisters.~
@491  = ~Well, thinking about it, I had little contact with the kids of my own age except for Imoen. But there were nice people around: Dreppin, the stable master, Fuller, the commander of Candlekeep Guard, and Hull, one of the guards. Then there was Phylidia, the mage whose absent-mindedness was well known, and of course Winthrop, the jolly innkeeper.~
@492  = ~I had spent much time with Gorion's friends. Most of them were old mages. Firebead Elvenhair, Tethoril, Parda and Karan... and all of the monks of course. Theodon and Jessup, to name a few, those two are great. They still haven't noticed that I am no longer two years old.~
@493  = ~I had some fighting practice even though it was not as structured as yours. Jondalar taught me a trick or two to keep me alive through a skirmish and Obe the Illusionist conjured a whole set of monsters once for me to get used to defending myself when the odds are not in my favor.~
@494  = ~What are you talking about? You want me to drone about people you don't even know and are unlikely to ever meet?~
@495  = ~I don't want to talk about it now.~
@496  = ~That is exactly what I want. What is so unusual about it?~
@497  = ~Oh well. There was Imoen... We spent so much time together you could almost consider us to be sisters.~
@498  = ~As you wish. Thinking about it, I had little contact with kids my own age, except for Imoen. But there were nice people around: Dreppin, the stable master, Fuller, the commander of Candlekeep Guard, and Hull, one of the guards. Then there was Phylidia, the mage whose absent-mindedness was well known, and of course Winthrop, the jolly innkeeper.~
@499  = ~Nothing unusual about that, you are right. I had spent much time with Gorion's friends. Most of them were old mages. Firebead Elvenhair, Tethoril, Parda and Karan... and all of the monks of course. Theodon and Jessup, to name a couple... those two are great. They still haven't noticed that I am no longer two years old.~
@500  = ~As you wish. I had some fighting practice even though it was not as structured as yours. Jondalar taught me a trick or two to keep me alive through a skirmish and Obe the Illusionist conjured a whole set of monsters for me to get used to defending myself when the odds are not in my favor.~
@501  = ~I don't want to talk about it now, Ajantis.~
@502  = ~I absolutely don't want to tell you the old stories. Your interest in them is more than a little strange.~
@503  = ~My lady, I just wished to use the opportunity to get to know you better. You are right however. This is really not necessary. Let us move on in silence - I will not bother you with my thoughts any longer.~
@504  = ~That sounds nice, my lady.~
@505  = ~You had many friends, my lady.~
@506  = ~I know the feeling. Sometimes it can be amusing when things like that happen. However, it can also be quite frustrating.~
@507  = ~Please, go on.~
@508  = ~I had some fighting practice even though it was not as structured as yours. Jondalar taught me a trick or two to keep me alive through a skirmish and Obe the Illusionist conjured a whole set of monsters for me to get used to defending myself when the odds are not in my favor.~
@509  = ~I think that's all there is to tell, Ajantis.~
@510  = ~I thank you for satisfying my curiosity. With all of my heart I hope that one day you will again find peace within the walls of your home.~
@511  = ~There is a lot to be done until then, however. Let us continue with our search.~
@512  = ~As you wish. It was not my intention to pester you with my curiosity. Let us continue with our search.~
@513  = ~As you wish, my lady. It was not my intention to bother you. Since I seem to be less tactful than what you are used to, I will spare you my thoughts in the future. Let us move on then.~
@514  = ~My lady, as I have already told you I am trying to win glory and honor to get knighted by the Order of the Most Radiant Heart. This is my goal, and I'm eagerly awaiting the day of my anointment.~
@515  = ~I can understand that. I imagine it will be an immensely edifying moment.~
@516  = ~Oh yes, it's good to have a goal for one's life.~
@517  = ~It seems to mean a lot to you indeed, as you talk about nothing else.~
@518  = ~Nice to know, but currently I don't want to talk about it.~
@519  = ~Not just this moment, lady <CHARNAME>, but my whole life afterwards. But you are right, the ceremony will be a rather solemn act.~
@520  = ~Indeed! What is a person without a goal to work towards? A sad creature, and a plaything in the hand of others.~
@521  = ~What? I beg your forgiveness, my lady, if I really bothered you that much.~
@522  = ~*smile* It's all right. I like listening to you.~
@523  = ~No, you didn't bother me. It's just that its importance to you is rather obvious.~
@524  = ~That's exactly the case, and I suggest we concentrate on other things instead.~
@525  = ~Oh, Ajantis, Ajantis. It will be at least ten years until you are old enough to hold an interesting conversation.~
@526  = ~I am relieved to hear that, my lady. When we converse about things unrelated to our quest,  I wish for them to be pleasant to your ears.~
@527  = ~On the receipt of my accolade, all those that are held dear to my heart shall be present.~
@528  = ~Sir Keldorn Firecam, a highly respected knight of the Order, was my mentor and he taught me a lot. I hope he will be there as well as my parents, my sister, and my brother.~
@529  = ~Oh yes, a mentor... It's always nice to see knowledge transferred trustfully from one generation to another.~
@530  = ~Is it a common procedure in the Order, that a squire gets assigned to a mentor?~
@531  = ~Great. Now let's move on, Ajantis.~
@532  = ~That is true. But of course not all learning is done like that - in some places, it is not possible. Myrmith Splendon, who instructed me in martial ways, earns his living by training others.~
@533  = ~Who is this Myrmith Splendon, by the way?~
@534  = ~Ajantis, I'm not really interested right now.~
@535  = ~Indeed, my lady. Only those who have found a mentor are accepted into the Order as squires. I was very fortunate to have been accepted by Sir Keldorn as his squire.~
@536  = ~Not all knowledge is passed on this way however... it couldn't be. As an example take Myrmith Splendon, my weapons master. He earns his living by giving lessons.~
@537  = ~Who is this Myrmith Splendon you keep talking about?~
@538  = ~Ajantis, this subject is of little interest to me.~
@539  = ~Myrmith is a "captain-at-arms", my lady, a professional who will train fighting men that are willing to pay his fees. He is a friendly yet vigilant person and a great master of his art. He makes his home in Waterdeep, and gives his lessons there.~
@540  = ~His training is of the best quality, my lady, and he is a highly sought master. Clients sometimes have to wait for weeks to get the training they desire - unless they are willing to pay more than double the normal price.~
@541  = ~Your money was invested well as you are an excellent fighter. Thank you for all of this interesting information, Ajantis.~
@542  = ~Aha. Well, that was very informative. Thanks, Ajantis.~
@543  = ~And then what? Other not so wealthy clients get bumped?~
@544  = ~Well... I assume that is the way it is.~
@545  = ~Considering he is so sought after I guess there is no other way. Thank you for telling me all this, Ajantis.~
@546  = ~And again you give me the distinct impression that your family is quite well off. It seems that you could afford paying double to get your lessons whenever you wanted.~
@547  = ~You are welcome, lady <CHARNAME>. Now let us continue with our duties and fight for honor and glory. I try to be more than a good warrior to you but also a good... companion. *clears his throat* Let us move on, for with every step we take I come closer to becoming a knight.~
@548  = ~My lady, you are being unjust. I have taken as many lessons as I deemed necessary to become a good and capable paladin.~
@549  = ~Well, I didn't mean to be. The money for the lessons was well spent as you have become a really good fighter. Thank you for telling me all this, Ajantis.~
@550  = ~Whatever. At least the money wasn't completely wasted.~
@551  = ~Oh, stop babbling. I can't bear your arrogance any longer.~
@552  = ~As you say, my lady. Let us move on, for with every step we take I come closer to becoming a knight.~
@553  = ~Forgive me my impertinent manner. I will keep my thoughts to myself in the future, if you prefer. Let us move on and do our duty.~
@554  = ~Thank you for the compliment, my lady. I always strive to be more than a good fighter, but also a good ...companion. *clears his throat* Let us move on, for with every step we take, I come closer to becoming a knight.~
@555  = ~May I take that as a compliment, my lady? I always strive to be more than a good fighter, but also a good ...companion. *clears his throat* Let us move on, for with every step we take, I come closer to becoming a knight.~
@556  = ~"Arrogance"? If this is your way of thinking, I will spare you from having to suffer through more, and keep my thoughts to myself.~
@557  = ~So let us move on, as many more tasks await us.~
@558  = ~Lady <CHARNAME>, may I share my thoughts with you? Talking about our homes has made me once again realize how lucky I was to be born into such a caring family. I wish everybody could grow up in such a loving home.~
@559  = ~It is a shame you never got to know your true parents, my lady. You never had the chance to grow up in a normal family.~
@560  = ~Yes, I would love to know my real parents. But I never met them, and now the only person who could answer my questions is... dead.~
@561  = ~Do you think my home wasn't supportive? With Gorion, I had a caring and wise mentor and father, Ajantis.~
@562  = ~Not everyone has as much luck as you do, Ajantis.~
@563  = ~Does the fact that I don't come from one of your 'happy' families make me some sort of deviant, or a second class citizen, Ajantis?~
@564  = ~I was never interested in getting to know my true parents, Ajantis.~
@565  = ~And lucky for you, it's none of your business.~
@566  = ~Then please forgive my curiosity, my lady.~
@567  = ~I will do that, my lady. I will keep my thoughts to myself from now on.~
@568  = ~I see how you are and can only admire you... Oh... I wished to say: 'the way you deal with your life.' No family could have prepared you better than Gorion obviously did.~
@569  = ~You misunderstood what I've just said. I didn't mean to boast of my family.~
@570  = ~No, of course it does not! I never meant to say that.~
@571  = ~No. I did not mean to imply that, my lady.~
@572  = ~Are you serious? I am very surprised... Yet I guess you have your reasons. I will have to accept that answer.~
@573  = ~I have to admit I have always been of the opinion that having a complete intact family with both parents and siblings is the best way for a person to grow up. Or, at least, that children coming from such a family have the best chances in life.~
@574  = ~It seems that I have to revise this opinion. The more I see, the more I come to understand that living in a "perfect" family is no guarantee for a loving, caring upbringing.~
@575  = ~That is somehow depressing to me, my lady. The reason I fight and am ready to give my life is to eliminate evil so that no more fathers or mothers are taken from their families. It is my hope that this will enable every child to grow up beloved and fearless... someday.~
@576  = ~It is the way people treat each other that is most important, Ajantis.~
@577  = ~You can't shield everybody. In some families the evil comes from within.~
@578  = ~Well, seems as if you just learned something very important about life, Ajantis.~
@579  = ~Ah, now there's your problem, yes? Life turns out to be more complicated than you would like to have it.~
@580  = ~Ajantis, you do not seriously believe that you will change the world, do you?~
@581  = ~Well, that's settled then, and we can continue.~
@582  = ~In a way I do, my lady. I am only one warrior in a war of many, but it is my true and humble belief that every act of righteousness, even the smallest one, will guide the world to become a better place for everyone.~
@583  = ~I seem to be upsetting you with my banter, lady <CHARNAME>. Should I refrain from talking to you in the future?~
@584  = ~No, I did not mean it that way. It's just that I don't want to talk about it right now.~
@585  = ~That is a good idea indeed. Please focus on your tasks, Ajantis.~
@586  = ~*sighs* You speak the truth, my lady.~
@587  = ~Alas, my lady, your words are very true. And yet, I still have the slight hope that when people have fewer sorrows, they will treat each other with love and respect, rather than with hatred and impudence.~
@588  = ~Yes, and I am truly sorry for you, my lady. Did Gorion never talk to you about your real parents?~
@589  = ~No, never...~
@590  = ~I don't think this is any business of yours, Ajantis.~
@591  = ~He surely had his reasons for not telling you anything - although it is hard to understand.~
@592  = ~Yes, and I am truly sorry for you, my lady.~
@593  = ~I did indeed. I must sound quite inexperienced by talking about such things.~
@594  = ~Yours were sharp words, my lady. But I cannot blame you: I must sound quite inexperienced by talking about such things.~
@595  = ~You must think me inexperienced in such things when I talk to you like that, my lady. I... thank you for your time. Let us move on and fight the evil in this world.~
@596  = ~I thank you for your time. Let us move on and fight any evil we come across.~
@597  = ~It is dark already, and the stars are out. I would suggest we look for a resting place, lady <CHARNAME>. Not only to regain our strength, but I also need time to clean and polish my weapons.~
@598  = ~I appreciate your advice, Ajantis. You are right - it's dark already.~
@599  = ~Ajantis, we have a good reason to be here during this time of the day, so please be patient.~
@600  = ~Ajantis, don't you think your weapons are well-tended enough?~
@601  = ~*mocking* Oh yes, let's look for a place to polish our weapons right away. Your armor badly needs cleaning, do you see that dirty spot there?~
@602  = ~It's my decision when to look for a resting place, Ajantis, not yours!~
@603  = ~Are you asking me seriously, my lady?~
@604  = ~What use will our weapons be if we do not maintain them properly? I am keeping to Helm's dogma: Care for your weapons so they may perform their duties when called upon.~
@605  = ~That makes a lot of sense, Ajantis.~
@606  = ~Yes, but you spend a whole lot of time fiddling with your weapons...~
@607  = ~Helm seems to have something useful for every occasion, eh?~
@608  = ~*sigh* It's all right, Ajantis. Somehow, it was clear that you would answer with a sentence containing "Helm".~
@609  = ~That's great, but let's move on now.~
@610  = ~Never mind. Please go on.~
@611  = ~I said I am fed up with your constantly talking about this Helm of yours!~
@612  = ~It does indeed, my lady. I live my life according to the rules that Helm and the Order have given me - I will fight and die by them, if necessary.~
@613  = ~It's a very noble-minded approach, Ajantis, full of self-sacrifice and discipline.~
@614  = ~Yes, but tell me, is there room in your heart for things like pleasure and poetry?~
@615  = ~Yes, I've heard that before. Let's move on.~
@616  = ~Lady <CHARNAME>, I live my life according to the rules that Helm and the Order have given me - I will fight and die by them, if necessary.~
@617  = ~Yes, I've heard that before... Let's move on.~
@618  = ~Of course, my lady.~
@619  = ~Really? Then name one poetic thing that you perceive at this very moment, Ajantis.~
@620  = ~What a relief. Let's move on then.~
@621  = ~Something poetic at this very moment? It's an unusual request, my lady, but not impossible for a paladin who should know poetry as well as fighting strategies. I see... two very poetic things right now.~
@622  = ~The first one is so simple. I beg you to raise your eyes to the sky, lady <CHARNAME>, where the stars are shining so brightly. I was aware of the innumerable lights filling the night sky even before I spoke. It is a breathtaking sight, giving us mortals moments of silent awe, reminding us to fill every day of our lives as best we can.~
@623  = ~The second poetic sight I refer to is of a different kind, my lady. It is related to the ballads of knights and heroes and beautiful maidens they meet on their travels. I should not continue in this vein, my lady, it would not be... appropriate. Please forgive me, I do not know why I mentioned this, I must have gotten carried away, somehow. *blushes*~
@624  = ~The starry sky is the only poetic thing I shall talk about tonight, lady <CHARNAME>.~
@625  = ~I see... *smile* Maybe you can tell me romantic tales about knights and beautiful maidens some other time then, hmm?~
@626  = ~Is it? Can you show me some constellations, Ajantis?~
@627  = ~All right, you proved your point. You do notice the lyric beauty of the world. Now let's move on.~
@628  = ~I know most of them, though I was never much interested in astronomy. At least not beyond what every self-reliant traveler needs to know. Yet star-lore is an ancient art that has been practiced for countless generations in every culture there has ever been. And, of course, each culture has its own names and interpretations for the constellations.~
@629  = ~Yes, I can imagine that. Elves, halflings and humans are sure to interpret them differently.~
@630  = ~How interesting. Which constellations do you know?~
@631  = ~Very nice, but you don't have to get into any details.~
@632  = ~Perhaps, my lady... *murmurs* No one knows where the gods lead us mortals... *clears his throat*~
@633  = ~What was that muttering of yours?~
@634  = ~Well, can you show me some constellations, Ajantis?~
@635  = ~All right, now let's move on.~
@636  = ~Yes, and sometimes the interpretations vary widely.~
@637  = ~Now, do you see the string of five stars over there? It is called Belnimbra's Belt. It was one of the first of Faerun's constellations that humans named. The name comes from the legend of the first human woman's transformation into a swan, trying to escape the pursuit of the god Lathander.~
@638  = ~The halflings include two other stars and call it The Pipe...~
@639  = ~The elves have a much darker interpretation of these five stars, they call them Corellon's Tears and believe that they were cried by Corellon when Lolth corrupted the drow and elves started to fight elves.~
@640  = ~Which other constellations can you show me?~
@641  = ~Show me a constellation that is more martial in its interpretation, Ajantis, a constellation that you can identify with as a warrior.~
@642  = ~Thank you. I think we have stargazed long enough. Tell me, Ajantis, does the starry sky remind you of how short our lives are? Does it motivate you to use your time well? Tell me, where would you prefer to be right now if you could be anywhere?~
@643  = ~I think I have watched the constellations long enough now. Time to go.~
@644  = ~Something more martial, a constellation that... *smile* Are you trying to embarrass me? Well, how about The Swordsman!~
@645  = ~You can see The Swordsman over there. It is also known as The Warrior or The Sentinel. Most cultures across Faerun give it the same attributes: guardianship, battle, loyalty, and freedom.~
@646  = ~Elves believe The Swordsman to be Auranamn, the first elf, who fought at Corellon's side, and was placed in the heavens after his death to guard and watch over the elven race.~
@647  = ~What's the bright, yellowish star in this constellation?~
@648  = ~I know this constellation. The bright star forming the pommel of the sword is called King's Coin.~
@649  = ~I think I have watched the constellations long enough now. Let us move on.~
@650  = ~This bright star is called The King's Coin and forms, as you can see, the pommel of the "sword" that the Swordsman holds in his hand.~
@651  = ~There is a story to this star, my lady. May I tell it to you?~
@652  = ~Yes, please do, Ajantis.~
@653  = ~No, that is not necessary, thank you. Tell me, Ajantis, does the starry sky remind you of how short our lives are? Does it motivate you to use your time well? Tell me, where would you prefer to be right now if you could be anywhere?~
@654  = ~No, thank you. Let us move on.~
@655  = ~There is a legend that the King's Coin shines brightly at the birth of kings that are destined for greatness. The star's ancient name, "Imadain", is said to come from the word "Imaskari", meaning "Lucky Star of the King".~
@656  = ~Again the legends of the elves are much darker. They know the star under the name of the "Kingslayer", and they watch its movements across the sky with great diligence. They believe that the "Kingslayer" helps predict the periodic occurrence of restlessness among the great wyrms, the Dragonrages.~
@657  = ~That was very interesting. Thank you. Tell me, Ajantis, does the starry sky remind you of how short our lives are? Does it motivate you to use your time well? Tell me, where would you prefer to be right now if you could be anywhere?~
@658  = ~A nice story, Ajantis, thank you. Now let us move on.~
@659  = ~Where would I prefer to be right now? Lady <CHARNAME>, I feel it is a great honor to be here with you... ahem... being able to travel with you. You are a very impressive... leader, my lady. Our deeds help me on my path towards knighthood and there is no place more beautiful... no other place that I would prefer to be.~
@660  = ~That was very nice of you to say, Ajantis. Thank you. *smile*.~
@661  = ~Then everything is well. Let us move on.~
@662  = ~Ajantis, I don't like the suggestive tone of your remark. If you are keen on romantic feelings please look elsewhere.~
@663  = ~"Suggestive tone"?! My lady, I am surprised by your words. Something I said has obviously upset you. That was not my intention, and I will keep my own counsel in the future so that this will not happen again.~
@664  = ~*smile* My lady, you are the brightest star of them all.~ [%tutu_var%AJANT35]
@665  = ~It is... very late. Please, give a thought to finding a resting place as I have suggested earlier.~
@666  = ~My lady, please chose your words carefully when speaking of the Vigilant One. It was not my intention to badger you with my thoughts. I will keep them to myself in the future so that this does not happen again. Let us move on.~
@667  = ~My lady, I thank you for your kind words.~
@668  = ~You are welcome. But I wonder if there is room in your heart for things like pleasure and poetry, Ajantis?~
@669  = ~You are welcome, now let's move on.~
@670  = ~Do not mock me, my lady. Every piece of equipment should be looked after, so that it provides the best performance. I am sure you agree with that.~
@671  = ~You are our leader indeed, my lady, and that makes you responsible for the wellbeing of the whole group. Driving your men too hard at the wrong time will not lead you to your goal faster. If we fail to rest, it might leave us weak when we need our strength the most.~
@672  = ~But you have made your point clear. I will keep my thoughts to myself from now on, if that is what you prefer. Let us move on then.~
@673  = ~You are our leader and I will accept your decisions, as long as they are in accordance with the ideals of good and righteousness. However, it is important to keep the balance: driving your men too hard at the wrong time will not lead you to your goal faster. If we fail to rest, it might leave us weak when we need our strength the most. The same is true if we fail to maintain our weapons and armor.~
@674  = ~Nothing, my lady, I was just... thinking to myself.~
@675  = ~Good morning, lady <CHARNAME>. I see you are awake.~
@676  = ~Good morning, Ajantis. I wanted to tell you that I loved talking of the stars with you yestereve.~
@677  = ~Good morning, Ajantis.~
@678  = ~I am glad you liked it, my lady. I also... liked it very much.~
@679  = ~Please excuse me for shaving while talking to a lady such as yourself... I am almost finished.~
@680  = ~Don't let me interrupt you, go on.~
@681  = ~I like the scratched-up little hand mirror that you use.~
@682  = ~I always try to adhere to a policy of cleanliness even under the adverse conditions that are to be expected during travels such as ours. A tidy appearance gives a favorable impression of the paladin and the Order he represents.~
@683  = ~I always try to adhere to a policy of cleanliness even under the adverse conditions that are to be expected during travels such as ours. A tidy appearance gives a favorable impression of the paladin and the Order he represents, as you know, my lady.~
@684  = ~A well-kept appearance is important, not only because it facilitates dealings with strangers, but it also shows a certain amount of self-discipline.~
@685  = ~Why are you so nervous, Ajantis? Is it my presence, or something about our talk last night?~
@686  = ~I concur. You look tidy and disciplined. I like both qualities in men.~
@687  = ~Nervous? I... I do not know what you mean. *turns red*~
@688  = ~I... am just not used to being watched by a lady while shaving. Please excuse me.~
@689  = ~I... thank you, my lady. For... for the compliment.~
@690  = ~Why are you so nervous, Ajantis?~
@691  = ~*nod approvingly and leave*~
@692  = ~My lady, ever since we've talked about our families, I've been wondering what type of life you would have preferred, had you not been forced into traveling the Sword Coast, chasing the murderers of your foster father.~
@693  = ~You mentioned once that you did not choose this. What would you do with your life, if you had the choice?~
@694  = ~You have been thinking about the type of life I would like to live? Why?~
@695  = ~I have gotten used to adventuring. I guess it is okay.~
@696  = ~My life will always be this way, Ajantis. My quest to battle evil will always drive me onward, just like it drives you.~
@697  = ~I would like to live my life in peace again, Ajantis. Maybe I will return to Candlekeep, maybe I will settle somewhere else.~
@698  = ~It is not worth discussing, Ajantis, as I cannot change the way I live at the moment.~
@699  = ~Would you be willing to tell me?~
@700  = ~Considering that we are traveling and fighting side by side, is it really that unusual that I wonder about you? Won't you oblige my curiosity?~
@701  = ~If you think so. I have actually gotten used to adventuring. I guess it's okay.~
@702  = ~My life will always be this way, Ajantis. My quest to battle evil will always drive me onward, just like it drives you.~
@703  = ~Oh well. I guess I would like to live my life in peace again, Ajantis. Maybe I will return to Candlekeep, maybe I will settle somewhere else.~
@704  = ~If you are worried that our pursuit of the villains that plague this land is influenced by some unspoken desires of mine, I assure you that this is not the case.~
@705  = ~Your interest in my innermost thoughts and feelings is quite obtrusive, Ajantis. Let us concentrate on our search. There remains much to be done.~
@706  = ~Yes, but would you choose this way of living if there were other options?~
@707  = ~No. Someday I will retire from adventuring, should that be an option.~
@708  = ~Yes, I would, Ajantis.~
@709  = ~Yes, I would, Ajantis. My quest to battle evil will always drive me onward, just like it drives you.~
@710  = ~Stop nagging me with your questions, Ajantis. I am not interested in conversing with you.~
@711  = ~I can understand your desire well. I hope things will turn out that way soon.~
@712  = ~No, my lady. That was not my reason for asking. I was just hoping that you'd share your thoughts on this with me.~
@713  = ~If you indeed need to know that, then the answer is that I have actually gotten used to adventuring. I guess it's okay.~
@714  = ~Then I will gladly share them with you. I would like to live my life in peace again, Ajantis. Maybe I will return to Candlekeep, maybe I will settle somewhere else.~
@715  = ~I am not surprised by your words, considering the path of righteousness you have chosen for yourself.~
@716  = ~Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. It was not my intention to bore you with my questions. I will spare you the grief of having any further discussions like this. Let us move on.~
@717  = ~Of course, forgive me for asking. I did not mean to be intrusive, my lady.~
@718  = ~I... understand.~
@719  = ~That sounds better, my lady. Sometimes the gods show us ways we cannot fathom.~
@720  = ~I guess I will always be traveling in the name of Helm and fighting against evil. I will be just like my mentor, Sir Keldorn, who still carries out field missions even though there is more gray than black in his beard. I would like to have a home to return to, just like he does, and be greeted by my family whenever I have time to spend home.~
@721  = ~Whenever you 'have time'? Wait a minute. Where is your family in your priority list? Is your duty as a paladin worth more to you than your family's welfare?~
@722  = ~Do you expect your wife to stay home while you travel?~
@723  = ~Well, we will see what fate awaits us. Let us move on.~
@724  = ~I did not intend to sound restrictive, my lady. All I want is to be able to offer my wife a safe home. I want to know that she is safe when I am in battle, and to know she will be there for me when I come home.~
@725  = ~Can't you imagine a woman at your side? One who shares your aspirations and joins you in battle...?~
@726  = ~Can't you imagine a woman at your side? One who shares your aspirations and joins you in battle?~
@727  = ~Oh, that is what you meant. Well, that doesn't sound too bad...~
@728  = ~I can imagine that for a son of a noble family,, it is very important to have a wife who thrives in her role as a mother and the lady of the house. A woman for whom representing her family matters more than having a life of her own.~
@729  = ~We will see what fate has waiting for us. Let us move on.~
@730  = ~That is an interesting question, lady <CHARNAME>. I told you how I had always imagined it would be one day... up until now...~
@731  = ~But enough of this idle talk. There is much to be done and we should not leave our enemies waiting.~
@732  = ~Well, I told you how I had always imagined it would be. But enough of this idle talk! Much work is awaiting us, and the earlier we start, the earlier your dream of a peaceful life will come true.~
@733  = ~I am pleased to hear that you agree, my lady... *ahem* But enough of this idle talk! Much work is awaiting us, and the earlier we start with it, the earlier your dream of a peaceful life will come true.~
@734  = ~I am pleased to hear that you agree, my lady... But enough of this idle talk! There is much to be done and we should not leave our enemies waiting.~
@735  = ~'Matters more than having a life of her own'? My lady, you have not understood a word of what I've said!~
@736  = ~I'm sorry. I don't seem to be able to stop myself from snapping at you now and then... I think I understand what you mean though.~
@737  = ~Oh, I have understood very well. I wish the future Lady Ilvastarr the best of luck. She will need it.~
@738  = ~Your words reassure me, my lady. Let us move on.~
@739  = ~Such impertinent words! I cannot believe I have to listen to this... scolding from you! I will spare you from having to listen to my thoughts in the future if all you can do is ridicule me for confiding in you. Let us move on.~
@740  = ~I fear that you are right, my lady. I was just hoping that you'd share your thoughts with me. We should not waste our time with things like this. Let us move on.~
@741  = ~I guess that is true, my lady. Let us move on - there is enough work waiting for us!~
@742  = ~I did not mean to burden you with my thoughts, my lady. I will keep them to myself in the future if you feel uncomfortable when I share them. Let us move on.~
@743  = ~Have you ever thought of having a family some day, my lady? To marry a man you love and have children together?~
@744  = ~Yes, that is something I have always wanted, Ajantis.~
@745  = ~If things should turn out that way, I would certainly like to, Ajantis. It seems a bit hard to plan though, doesn't it?~
@746  = ~I never intended to marry anyone. Children - well if I get pregnant...~
@747  = ~I will never have children, Ajantis. They would tie me down too much.~
@748  = ~I find this question a bit too intimate, Ajantis. I prefer not to answer it.~
@749  = ~That is none of your business, paladin!~
@750  = ~I guess you are right, as the gods sometimes show us unfathomable ways.~
@751  = ~I am amazed at your casual attitude towards this subject, my lady. Why wouldn't you consider strengthening the natural bond based on having children with the traditional bond of marriage?~
@752  = ~Well, if you look at it that way... Maybe I shouldn't preclude it completely. It depends on the man I have children with, I guess.~
@753  = ~Ajantis, children can just 'happen.' As mortals we can't always control things like that. But I am sure that I would never devote my life to a man that way.~
@754  = ~It makes me sad to hear that you place such a low value on the holy oath that a woman and a man give before the gods and the society they live in.~
@755  = ~Hearing that makes me sad, but I guess it is your decision to make. I would like to pass my knowledge and my experience to my children and see them grow.~
@756  = ~I would not put it that way, my lady. But my duties as a paladin do require my full dedication. I will care for my family as best I can, making sure they lack nothing when I am called away.~
@757  = ~Sounds fair. But do you expect your wife to stay home while you are traveling?~
@758  = ~This is not a realistic approach, Ajantis. When you're dealing with family, and especially children, I think that the children have to be the most important part of your life. There is no other way. Your paladin duties will make you a bad father, and maybe even a bad husband. Aren't you afraid of this?~
@759  = ~So your duties do mean more to you than family. No, I could never imagine spending my life with someone who admits this so easily. I don't think that the future Lady Ilvastarr will be a happy woman.~
@760  = ~No, I am not afraid of being a bad husband or father, my lady. As I said, I will take care of my family as best I can. I will often be away, and this might not be acceptable for every woman. I will have to count on her support.~
@761  = ~Don't mind my questions, Ajantis. I am sure you are capable of handling this properly, and I believe your duties will not distract you from your dedication to your family... As soon as you will start one. *smile*~
@762  = ~I see. But do you expect your wife to stay home while you are traveling?~
@763  = ~But your duties do mean more to you than family. No, I could never imagine spending my life with someone who admits this so easily. I don't think that the future Lady Ilvastarr will be a happy woman.~
@764  = ~Uh-huh. And the enthusiastic support of her lover. Because, my young fool, the only woman of flesh and blood who would find a wandering husband 'acceptable' is one who belongs to another man in heart and body, if not in name.~
@765  = ~I do not know what I did to earn these insults, my lady. It was not my intention to bore you with my questions. I will spare you any further discussions of this type in the future. Let us move on.~
@766  = ~I am... very happy to hear you say  that, my lady.~
@767  = ~But do you expect your wife to stay home while you are traveling?~
@768  = ~Lady <CHARNAME>, during our last battle I was once again fortunate enough to be able to admire your fighting style.~
@769  = ~Thank you for the compliment, Ajantis.~
@770  = ~Meaning?~
@771  = ~Ajantis, I do not appreciate compliments like these. I know quite well that I am a capable adventurer.~
@772  = ~My lady, even though I wish that your choices were more righteous than they are, I have to tell you that I admire your fighting style.~
@773  = ~That was not meant to be a simple compliment, my lady.~
@774  = ~You are a master of your trade and your leadership shows skill with tactics and strategy. You have learned a lot in the past weeks.~
@775  = ~Hearing such praise from a skilled fighter like you is a great honor, Ajantis. Thank you.~
@776  = ~What you said is very flattering, Ajantis. I wish it were true but you surely exaggerate.~
@777  = ~Thanks for putting it that way, Ajantis, but I wish that everyone in our party would think for himself. That would free me from having to give orders at all.~
@778  = ~Oh stop that. You're simply not the type for flattering words, Ajantis, and I would appreciate it if you did not try to become that way. Speak up only if you have something substantial to say.~
@779  = ~And who are you to give me this accolade? A prelate of the Order? A sage? A battle-hardened veteran? Ah, no. You are a squire, barely out of your swaddling clothes. I am afraid that your praise diminishes when viewed in this light. ~
@780  = ~You must be jesting! Fighting as a group requires the guidance of a skilled leader like you, my lady.~
@781  = ~You are very talented, lady <CHARNAME>, as I think everyone in our group would agree.~
@782  = ~It is remarkable, especially considering that you were more or less forced into living like this.~
@783  = ~And it is remarkable when... when seeing you, my lady.~
@784  = ~What do you mean by that?~
@785  = ~You mean that I don't look like a heroine? Well, you are probably right.~
@786  = ~That did not sound like a compliment, Ajantis.~
@787  = ~*hesitant* Ah, I guess I should explain my words... *coughs* Please excuse me, my lady. It is just that you... under all of the dirt and grime of our trials, there is an extremely beautiful young lady.~ [%tutu_var%AJANT35]
@788  = ~When you smile, your eyes shine brightly. It's a lovely sight, my lady. *ahem* You are... you are like a summer breeze over the gently rippling waves of the ocean near  my hometown, Waterdeep.~
@789  = ~Thank you, Ajantis - what a beautiful comparison. *smile*~
@790  = ~Hmm... Is this the tale about knights and beautiful maidens you were referring to not so long ago?~
@791  = ~So I am dirty and to be compared with the water in the harbor of some large city? Or am I akin to the draft, in your opinion?~
@792  = ~What was that? I never thought you were capable of talking like this, Ajantis.~
@793  = ~You are making me blush, Ajantis. I... don't want you to talk to me like that. We are good companions, and fight together for a common goal, but nothing more than that.~
@794  = ~What?! No, no! Please excuse my blundering efforts to describe your lovely figure in a more poetic way. I guess I am not very good at this.~
@795  = ~*laugh* Ajantis, don't let me disconcert you so easily! I was only joking. I thought your comparison was very flattering.~
@796  = ~It's all right, Ajantis, but I don't appreciate that type of compliment.~
@797  = ~Indeed, you are not. Maybe you should refrain from giving comments that have nothing to do with our quest in the future.~
@798  = ~Then please excuse my obtrusiveness, my lady. Let me emphasize though that what I said was more than mere compliments. *blushes slightly* It was... my true opinion.~
@799  = ~That is exactly the smile I meant. *smiles warmly* It is an honor that you bestow on others, <CHARNAME>.~
@800  = ~But I am wasting your time... we should be moving on.~
@801  = ~Please excuse me, my lady. I did not mean to bother you. I will cease my pitiful attempts at sharing my thoughts with you from now on.~
@802  = ~I ask your forgiveness, my lady. It was never my intention to bother you... in any way. I will keep my thoughts to myself in the future.~
@803  = ~*coughs* Did you find those words inappropriate, my lady?~
@804  = ~No, it was a beautiful comparison! *smile*~
@805  = ~No... Is this the tale about knights and beautiful maidens you were referring to not long ago?~
@806  = ~Well, I wonder whether you think I am dirty and therefore remind you of the waters in the harbor of some large city?~
@807  = ~I am only a squire knight, lady <CHARNAME>, but the part about the beautiful maiden... Would you... would you like it to be so? Like in the bards' tales?~
@808  = ~Maybe - it was a beautiful comparison! *smile*~
@809  = ~And I thought you just called me dirty and resembling the water in the harbor of some large city.~
@810  = ~I never thought you were capable of talking like this, Ajantis!~
@811  = ~I don't want you to talk to me like that. We are good companions, and fight together for a common goal, but nothing more than that.~
@812  = ~My lady, do you see the blossoms that are spreading along the path?~
@813  = ~Do you mean these?~
@814  = ~Are you talking about the Velvethearts?~
@815  = ~I think there are more urgent things to attend to than looking at flowers, Ajantis.~
@816  = ~They are called Velvethearts, my lady. While the blossoms aren't bigger than my thumbnail, their fragrance is pleasantly sweet. It is also a helpful flower to know: From its roots they brew a healing potion. Let me pick one so you can have a closer look...~
@817  = ~I like this flower very much, Ajantis.~
@818  = ~Well... thank you.~
@819  = ~Ajantis, I'm not in the mood for a lecture about Faerun flora right now.~
@820  = ~That is the name. You seem to know these red flowers, so I presume you know that they are praised for their sweet fragrance. If I am not mistaken they also use the roots for brewing a healing potion. A helpful little flower... Let me pick one for you, my lady.~
@821  = ~I am delighted to hear that my lady. I would like to give it to you.~
@822  = ~Oh, how sweet, Ajantis. Do you want to put it in my hair?~
@823  = ~Thank you, Ajantis! My pack is rather full at the moment. Do you want to tuck it in my belt?~
@824  = ~Ajantis, I don't want to get romantic flowers from you. We are nothing but fighting comrades.~
@825  = ~In your hair? What a lovely idea, my lady!~
@826  = ~Then let me push back this strand... *you feel his touch above the ear* I... am not used to being so close to... *coughs*~
@827  = ~I hope I didn't just pull at your wonderful, soft hair...~
@828  = ~*ahem* The flower should stay in place now. My lady, you look beautiful. Ahem... you look beautiful regardless, but with the flower in your hair, you are especially lovely.~
@829  = ~*smile* Ajantis, I thank you for the present.~
@830  = ~*grins* You are lovely sometimes as well, you know that? Thank you for the flower.~
@831  = ~Well... thank you, Ajantis.~
@832  = ~*sigh* All right, are you done?~
@833  = ~On your belt? If... you wish, my lady.~
@834  = ~It seems I have to kneel to be able to see what I am doing... *He sticks the flower in your belt. You get the impression that his fingers are slightly trembling.*~
@835  = ~I am sorry if I pinched you while doing this, lady <CHARNAME>. I never adorned a lady's belt... *coughs* equipment before.~
@836  = ~The flower should stay in place now. My lady, you look beautiful. Ahem... you look beautiful regardless, but with a flower, you are especially lovely.~
@837  = ~*smile* Ajantis, I thank you for that present.~
@838  = ~*sigh* All right, have you finished?~
@839  = ~To adorn you with a flower has been a great pleasure for me.~
@840  = ~To adorn your beautiful hair with a flower has been a great pleasure for me.~
@841  = ~My lady, you are right, we have no time for idleness. And yet it is important to be aware of the pleasant things that lie on our path. There is enough evil and ugliness around.~
@842  = ~My lady, I would like to give this flower to you.~
@843  = ~Oh! All right, do you want to put it in my hair?~
@844  = ~A "lecture" was not what I intended. I beg your forgiveness, if I bored you.~
@845  = ~No, I didn't mean it that way. I just don't want to linger here, Ajantis, with so many dangers awaiting us.~
@846  = ~Ajantis, the only thing I wish to discuss with you are our battle plans. Keep your other 'ideas' to yourself.~
@847  = ~That I will! I made a fool of myself, talking to you like this!~
@848  = ~I see. My lady, I did not mean to be intrusive, and I will stop pestering you from now on.~
@849  = ~I am sorry if I... disturbed you in any way, my lady.~
@850  = ~No, I didn't mean it that way. Thank you for the flower, Ajantis.~
@851  = ~If you are always that clumsy, you should give a thought to developing a higher degree of agility in your fingers.~
@852  = ~"Clumsy"?... *bitterly* My lady, I seek your forgiveness for having troubled you with my clumsiness. I will make sure that I concentrate on my training as you suggested.~
@853  = ~My lady, might I pose a private question? We are spending a lot of time traveling and fighting together, and I've started to wonder about one thing. No one should face the evil in this world alone. Have you ever... Has there ever been a man you valued above all others, someone you wish to return to once our quest is done?~
@854  = ~No, there is no such person, Ajantis. Why do you ask?~
@855  = ~I am not alone, Ajantis. I am traveling with comrades, all of them brave and loyal.~
@856  = ~Yes, there is a man I love, Ajantis. Someone... someone else.~
@857  = ~This question is one I don't want to answer, Ajantis.~
@858  = ~I thank you for the implicit compliment. Yet I meant someone special. A man who has a place in your heart.~
@859  = ~Yes, there is a man I love, Ajantis. Someone... someone else.~
@860  = ~I understood perfectly what you meant and I don't want to talk about this.~
@861  = ~*faint sigh of relief* I was just... wondering, my lady.~
@862  = ~As an offspring of a noble family I have to comply with certain rules concerning the choice of my future spouse. Yet I am the fourth child, so I have a degree of freedom. My parents will not make a betrothal without my knowledge.~
@863  = ~Of course I would have to get their consent, before I propose. I wrote a letter to them, my lady. *coughs* I meant to say I would have to write them one, if I wished to propose, as I am unlikely to undertake a journey to my family in Waterdeep at the moment.~
@864  = ~It is... an unexpected situation, my lady. I did not set out on my mission with the intention to find a beloved wife during my travels. There was never such a person for me before.~
@865  = ~"Never before"? *look deep into his eyes* But now... there is one?~
@866  = ~There's no girl waiting for you in Waterdeep? No fair maiden waiting for her knight in shining armor to return?~
@867  = ~Well, I am not really surprised. Your heart is filled with your passionate desire to fight evil; there is hardly any space left for things like that.~
@868  = ~This conversation is getting a bit too intimate for me. Let's stop it here.~
@869  = ~Do you really think so? You've said it without hesitation, my lady, and it surprises me deeply. I was hoping you would have a different impression of me.~
@870  = ~You are wrong, and I will prove it to you. But, ah, I did not mean to tell you this much. If you do not mind, I will not take this further. Not at this very moment, at least.~
@871  = ~My lady, if this is your belief maybe I shouldn't bore you any longer. I will spare you idle talk from now on and concentrate on my duties as a paladin.~
@872  = ~*Squire* paladin, my lady. No, there is no fair maiden waiting for me in Waterdeep or any other place.~
@873  = ~Please forgive me for raising such an issue. I somehow got carried away talking to you, beautiful lady <CHARNAME>.~
@874  = ~*sigh* No, no more of that. I would like to stop our conversation here. There will be more time to talk later.~
@875  = ~Of... course. Please forgive me for raising such an issue.~
@876  = ~I understand... My lady, please forgive me for raising such an issue. I will concentrate on my duties from now on, and keep my thoughts to myself. Let's move on.~
@877  = ~*with a slight cringe under your gaze* As a paladin I have vowed to tell only the truth. You... you are about to ensnare me with it. I did not mean to tell you this much. If you do not mind, I would not take this further. Not at this very moment, at least. Forgive me for raising this issue in the first place. I seem to get carried away while talking to you, beautiful lady.~
@878  = ~*sigh* No, no more of that. Please, my lady, forgive me. There will be more time to talk later.~
@879  = ~My lady, now that everyone is preparing to rest, could I speak to you about an important matter? Please, let us step away from the others.~
@880  = ~Surely, Ajantis. What is on your mind?~
@881  = ~Hmmm... The knight is leading me away, I wonder what he wants?~
@882  = ~Does it have something to do with the mysterious messenger we met today?~
@883  = ~Ajantis, does it have to be now? I am very tired.~
@884  = ~I am not a knight yet, but you know that already. I want to tell you something very important and... private, my lady.~
@885  = ~My lady, I have an overwhelming urge to talk to you now... Please, I want to tell you something very important and... private.~
@886  = ~My fair lady, you surely noticed my... affection for you. You are a very brave woman, valiant and righteous. Your fighting prowess is unmatched, and you are leading the group with great skill. You have faced terrible trials and have lost neither courage nor humor.~
@887  = ~All that in addition to your charm. My lady, I lack the proper words to describe your beauty!~
@888  = ~It took me a long time to realize that my feelings for you were far more than respect for a capable leader. I admire you. I fell in love with you, <CHARNAME>, and I love you truly, deeply, fiercely.~
@889  = ~You already saw the messenger, Douglas. He brought me the consent of my family to propose to <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep, foster daughter of the well-known sage, Gorion. He also brought me this, as I requested beforehand, in the hope that it will adorn your finger from now on... *reveals a golden ring with a light-blue gem*~
@890  = ~My lady, I am nothing but a humble squire, and yet I want to ask you... <CHARNAME>, will you marry me?~
@891  = ~I love you too, Ajantis, and happily accept your proposal.~
@892  = ~Oh, my brave knight. *you kiss him on the lips* Yes, I want to marry you!~
@893  = ~Ajantis, I didn't realize your feelings for me were so intense!~
@894  = ~Ajantis, I thank you for these kind words, but I'm in love with another man.~
@895  = ~Ajantis, I am fond of you as a fighting comrade and loyal companion, but nothing more.~
@896  = ~What do you mean, you "have the consent of your family"? They live far to the North in Waterdeep and I've never met them before.~
@897  = ~No, I don't want to marry you, Ajantis.~
@898  = ~Oh dear, a heart-sick paladin in the group is the last thing I need right now!~
@899  = ~<CHARNAME>, your words fill my heart with great joy! Let me give you this ring as a sign of my true and humble desire. It belongs to my family. I requested it for you, and my parents sent it with their blessings for our engagement.~
@900  = ~Ajantis, this ring is beautiful! Thank you so much.~
@901  = ~I was wondering about the messenger. Now that I know, it makes me very happy.~
@902  = ~If the ring is an Ilvastarr's heirloom, I will wear it with great pride.~
@903  = ~Thank you, Ajantis.~
@904  = ~They are, my lady. I thought you might have noticed...~
@905  = ~They are, my lady...~
@906  = ~You are... My lady, please forgive my transgression. I did not know. I will not pester you again with my love. Let us move on then, and do our duty.~
@907  = ~I see. My lady, please forgive my transgression. I did not know. I will not pester you again with my love. Let us move on then, and do our duty.~
@908  = ~I am taken aback by your disparaging words, my lady. If this is your reply, I withdraw my proposal and will not pester you again with my love. Let us move on then, and do our duty.~
@909  = ~Then I shouldn't keep you awake. There will be time to talk: we will walk on the path of good and righteousness together. I will care for you and protect you with all the might Helm has given me. I will be as good a husband as I can be for you, and the proudest man in the whole world, with you at my side.~
@910  = ~Go to sleep knowing that you are my one true love, <CHARNAME>. I will stay awake tonight, for my heart is pounding from excitement. I will guard your sleep, I will not be able to take my eyes off you. I will stand a vigil till dawn, thanking Helm for the kind blessings he bestowed on me.~
@911  = ~It is true you never met them before, my lady, yet I had to request the consent of my family before revealing my feelings to you. We talked about this not long ago, but... Please, my lady, have mercy, what is your answer?~
@912  = ~It indeed is related to the small encounter we had today. I want to tell you something very important and... private, my lady.~
@913  = ~...My lady! You took me by surprise with that kiss. *blushes*~
@914  = ~Please, come into my arms so I can hold you close! *Ajantis puts his arms around you and embraces you tenderly.* ~
@915  = ~*Raise your lips to his*~
@916  = ~I like it when you hold me in your arms, Ajantis.~
@917  = ~I think we should rest now, Ajantis, I am very tired.~
@918  = ~*His lips find yours and he gives you a soft, shy kiss.*~
@919  = ~<CHARNAME>, holding you so close is precious to me. I want to spend the rest of my life sharing moments like these with you. We will walk on the path of goodness and righteousness together. I will care for you and protect you with all the might Helm has given me. I will be as good a husband as I can be for you, and the proudest man in all the world with you at my side, <CHARNAME>, my dear love.~
@920  = ~My love, I enjoyed adorning you with a flower once, but it is gone now. Let me give you another flower, one that will not fade.~
@921  = ~I would love to see such a flower, Ajantis.~
@922  = ~A flower? Where did you get a flower from, Ajantis?~
@923  = ~If you think so...~
@924  = ~Ajantis, not now, please. I am thinking of the powerful and dangerous enemies threatening us.~
@925  = ~The flowers I showed you once are long gone, my love. Let me give you another flower, one that will not fade.~
@926  = ~Then my gift will please you all the more, beloved <CHARNAME>. Have a look.~
@927  = ~It is not a common flower. *Ajantis fetches a necklace from under his coat.* It is this necklace with a flower-shaped pendant that I want to give you.~
@928  = ~Oh, Ajantis, it is beautiful!~
@929  = ~I thought you were talking about a real flower... Is it special?~
@930  = ~I have to admit that it's not really to my taste. It's too ornate, too showy...~
@931  = ~I am glad you like it. It's a courting gift, to express my love. The pendant is enchanted: wear it, and it will protect you from evil.~
@932  = ~What a present! Where did you get this? I haven't seen it in your backpack, my secretive paladin.~
@933  = ~Ajantis, this is a precious gift. Thank you very much! *You kiss him.*~
@934  = ~The pendant is enchanted. It's a courting gift, to express my love. Wear it, and it will protect you from evil.~
@935  = ~I am sorry; I was hoping to please you, but it is difficult to satisfy someone with such exquisite taste. Still, I give it to you to express my love. The pendant is enchanted: wear it, and it will protect you from evil. You can hide it under your clothes if it's too gaudy.~
@936  = ~I should not have criticized a gift from the heart. Where did you get this? I haven't seen it in your backpack, my secretive paladin.~
@937  = ~Ajantis, despite all, your gift is precious to me. Thank you very much! *You kiss him.*~
@938  = ~What a lovely reward, <CHARNAME>. *smile*~
@939  = ~*smile* I have kept but one secret, beloved. I have carried this gift near my heart for quite a while.~
@940  = ~Ajantis, this is a precious gift. Thank you very much! *You kiss him.*~
@941  = ~Wear this flower, <CHARNAME>, and it will protect you in battles against the evil of this world.~
@942  = ~It is night again... Have a look at the stars, <CHARNAME>, how they are shining so brightly. They remind me of another night, not long ago.~
@943  = ~Well, we didn't really talk about the stars back then, because we had to go. Yet the stars shine tonight just as brilliantly.~
@944  = ~We had a... special talk about poetry on that night, my love. *smile*~
@945  = ~I was so confused about my own feelings for you at that time. Now I am here at your side, calling you my lovely betrothed. I can put my arms around you, hold you close, kiss you...~
@946  = ~Such is the closeness we share now. I wanted to ask you, are you satisfied with that? Or would you like us to become... more intimate? Forgive me. What a clumsy question! I am not experienced at all in these things.~
@947  = ~Let us remain chaste until after the wedding, Ajantis.~
@948  = ~You are a paladin, and we are on a great quest with many powerful enemies to overcome. Perhaps waiting a bit before becoming lovers is a good idea.~
@949  = ~It is not a clumsy question at all, Ajantis. I want more as well.~
@950  = ~Ajantis, all we do is hug and kiss... I would like to get closer than that, yes.~
@951  = ~What a question! I would have expected a man to use this romantic situation to get more...~
@952  = ~Maybe another men would, <CHARNAME>. But what do you want?~
@953  = ~I see it the way you do, my love. Of course I feel attracted to you, and as a man I desire you greatly. But our relationship's just started, and I am responsible for what would become of you and our possible child, if something should ever happen to me.~
@954  = ~I want you to have the formal support of my family if it ever comes to that, thus waiting until after our wedding is a good idea.~
@955  = ~That suits me perfectly, Ajantis. There is no need to rush these things. *smile* Why harvest fruit before it ripens?~
@956  = ~Hmm... Now that I think of it I would like to do more than hug and kiss before that time, Ajantis. If the thought of getting me with child is the only thing that makes you restrain your desire, there are certain herbs available.~
@957  = ~I am happy we agree on this, my love. There is indeed no need to rush with this at all. My love is more than satisfying physical needs. I will hold you in my arms tonight, breathing in the fragrance of your hair, and I will enjoy the closeness that we share now.~
@958  = ~I want you to have the formal support of my family, which I hope they will grant you. But regardless of how my family treats our bond, waiting until after our wedding is a good idea.~
@959  = ~*in a rather breathless voice* You would?~
@960  = ~I... was not sure what you would say, my love. Of course I feel attracted to you, and as a man, I desire you greatly. But our relationship's just started, and I am responsible for what would become of you and our possible child, if something should ever happen to me.~
@961  = ~You mean we should wait until after the wedding for the sake of a possible child?~
@962  = ~What is it you are trying to tell me, Ajantis?~
@963  = ~...You didn't make some obscure vow of chastity, did you?~
@964  = ~Chastity? Well... chastity it is. But it is not the result of an 'obscure vow,' my love, but of my feelings of responsibility for you.~
@965  = ~I want you to have the formal support of my family for you and our possible child, should I fall on the battlefield. Thus, waiting until after our wedding is a good idea.~
@966  = ~Now that I think of this, it suits me perfectly, Ajantis. There is no need to rush these things. *smile* Why harvest fruit before it ripens?~
@967  = ~That is very honorable, Ajantis. But if the thought of getting me with child is the only thing that makes you restrain your desire, there are certain herbs available.~
@968  = ~Ajantis, if it is important to you, I will accept this gladly. Yet I would very much like to know the intimacy that only lovers have. To me it is far more than a physical pleasure, or a marital duty. It would be the material fulfilment of the spiritual bond between us, becoming as close together as mortals can.~
@969  = ~I don't understand your concern. We are engaged and I want you to spend the night with me as my lover, Ajantis.~
@970  = ~I want you to have the formal support of my family, which I hope they will grant you and our possible child, <CHARNAME>, should I fall on the battlefield. But regardless of how my family treats our bond, waiting until after our wedding is a good idea.~
@971  = ~That is true, but what we are talking about is far more than a physical act to me...~
@972  = ~There is... truth in these words indeed. It is far more than a physical act to me, too...~
@973  = ~It makes me sad that you do not see what I mean, but I appreciate that you express your wishes directly. Yet... what we are talking about is far more than a physical act to me.~
@974  = ~It is late now, my love. We should look for a resting place, to replenish our strength for the upcoming battles. I will... hold you in my arms tonight, breathing in the fragrance of your hair, and I will enjoy the closeness as we share it now. Let us talk more of this at another time.~
@975  = ~Is this where we are going to rest? Time to take care of my weapons and equipment.~
@976  = ~'Care for your weapons so they may perform their duties when called upon'?...~
@977  = ~*You gather your equipment and place yourself beside Ajantis.* That sounds like something I should do, too.~
@978  = ~*Yawn* Good night, Ajantis.~
@979  = ~*smile* Exactly, my love.~
@980  = ~Well, good night then, Ajantis.~
@981  = ~*Ajantis leans over to you and gives you a kiss on the forehead.* Sleep well, my love.~
@982  = ~Hmmm, a real kiss would be nice, too! *smile*~
@983  = ~Sleep well, Ajantis.~
@984  = ~*in a whisper* As you wish, my lady. *He kisses you.*~
@985  = ~I wish you a good night, and may your sleep be restful.~
@986  = ~*Ajantis leans over to you and gives you a kiss on the forehead.* Do you feel like... talking about what we've discussed recently?~
@987  = ~*smile* Now, what was that again?~
@988  = ~Definitely. I would like you to become my lover, Ajantis... But your opinion hasn't changed, has it?~
@989  = ~Don't tell me you are suddenly ready to spend the night with me.~
@990  = ~Ah, don't worry. I thought about it and I share the same opinion. Let us wait until after the wedding; there is no need to rush these things.~
@991  = ~I never said I would not be, <CHARNAME>, my love. I just expressed my concern about doing it too early.~
@992  = ~And you are right about that. I've thought about it, and I share the same opinion. Let us wait until after the wedding; there is no need to rush.~
@993  = ~So, what is your conclusion?~
@994  = ~There is no such thing as 'too early,' Ajantis. Not for the two of us, with the promises we made and the feelings that we share.~
@995  = ~I... was thinking about whether it is appropriate for a paladin to spend the night with the woman he intends to marry, and have come to the conclusion that there is no reason why it should not be. I love you and care for you. I have devoted myself to you, <CHARNAME>, and will protect you. You have my loyalty. I put duty before all else, and if you look at it that way, there are even... particular duties in love. *blushes*~
@996  = ~I have to admit that I felt rather insecure when it came to intimacy, and knowing your desire has helped me to overcome my... fears.~
@997  = ~It might be considered a mere physical pleasure by many, but not by me, my love. It is far more than that, and I am looking forward to sharing this experience with you.~
@998  = ~Yet my concern about getting you with child remains. That is why I bought the medicinal herbs, beloved, brewed them and imbibed the potion that will prevent this from happening. I am ready to show you my love and devotion tonight, or at any night you wish me to.~
@999  = ~Ajantis! I did expect a lot of things, but not this! *laughs*~
@1000 = ~Ajantis, I am happy to hear you say  this. I think I am not *that* tired... So how about now?~
@1001 = ~Ajantis, I am happy to hear you say  this! *You put your equipment beside you.* So, how about now?~
@1002 = ~*You pull his face towards yours and give him a long, passionate kiss.*~
@1003 = ~I am happy to hear it. I am too tired now, but on another night, I'd like you to come to me.~
@1004 = ~You bought contraceptives? That is... very well planned.~
@1005 = ~Do you see this as your *duty*?~
@1006 = ~I don't think I am ready just now, Ajantis. Our recent discussion has quenched my desire.~
@1007 = ~I thought about what you said lately, Ajantis, and I think it makes sense. Let us wait until after the wedding. There is no need to rush.~
@1008 = ~<CHARNAME>, what do you mean?~
@1009 = ~*You pull his face towards yours and give him a long, sensual kiss.*~
@1010 = ~Do you really see this as your *duty*?~
@1011 = ~*You feel Ajantis melt under your touch.* <CHARNAME>...~
@1012 = ~I am happy, my love. I am too tired now, but on another night, I'd like you to come to me.~
@1013 = ~Do you really see this as your *duty*, Ajantis?~
@1014 = ~That sounds as if you did not approve, <CHARNAME>.~
@1015 = ~Did it? *You pull his face towards yours and give him a long, sensual kiss.*~
@1016 = ~Not at all. I think I am not *that* tired... So how about now?~
@1017 = ~Not at all. *You put your equipment beside you.* So, how about now?~
@1018 = ~Don't worry. I am happy to hear it. I am too tired now, but on another night, I'd like you to come to me.~
@1019 = ~I thought about what you said lately, Ajantis, and think it makes sense. Let us wait until after the wedding, there is no need to rush.~
@1020 = ~Then I'll wish you a good night, <CHARNAME>. May your sleep be restful.~
@1021 = ~I see it as my duty to give you - mind, heart and body - everything you need to feel loved, my beautiful <CHARNAME>. And... apart from that, I desire you.~
@1022 = ~I... am happy to hear that, my love. *He leans over to you and gives you a tender kiss.* Then I'll wish you a good night, <CHARNAME>. May your sleep be restful.~
@1023 = ~You do? What an unexpected change of heart. My love, if this is your will I am happy with this. There is no need to rush it at all.~
@1024 = ~*breathes in heavily* You mean here? Right now? I... Yes, of course, my love. *He leans over to you and gives you a tender kiss, touching you on your cheek with trembling fingers.* Let me... Let me just finish with my equipment... and I will be with you momentarily.~
@1025 = ~You are taking care of your equipment in an exemplary manner, <CHARNAME>.~
@1026 = ~*smile* It's all due to your good influence, Ajantis.~
@1027 = ~It's not only Helmites that see the sense in caring for their fighting gear, Ajantis. A person who neglects her equipment need not wonder why it should fail in the time of need.~
@1028 = ~Sure. I didn't feel like talking.~
@1029 = ~It's not only Helmites that see the sense in caring for the fighting gear, Ajantis. A person who neglects her equipment need not wonder why it should fail in the time of need.~
@1030 = ~*Ajantis leans over to you and gives you a kiss on the forehead.* Of course, I am sorry. I wish you a good night, my love.~
@1031 = ~Thank you for this compliment, beautiful lady, although I doubt it is true. *smile*~
@1032 = ~That is very true, my love, and this is exactly the reason why it makes me happy to see that you keep your gear properly maintained.~
@1033 = ~*Ajantis leans over to you and gives you a kiss on the forehead.* Let us finish what we are doing and get some rest. Tomorrow will be another challenging day.~
@1034 = ~I... am happy to hear that, my love. *He leans over to you and gives you a tender kiss.* Let us finish what we are doing and get some rest. Tomorrow will be another challenging day.~
@1035 = ~I am sorry to hear that, although all I am doing is making you an offer. Let us finish what we are doing and get some rest. Tomorrow will be another challenging day.~
@1036 = ~*smile* Good morning, my love. Did you sleep well?~
@1037 = ~What a question! The night was a bit... shorter than the others, was it not? *grin*~
@1038 = ~Indeed. Very good, to be precise.~
@1039 = ~Not really, but not because of our... activities. *smile*~
@1040 = ~*snort* What a question!~
@1041 = ~<CHARNAME>, what I felt last night was so intense... I never would have believed that a man... that *I* could experience such bliss. I enjoyed it... (By Helm, words are useless... ) and I am deeply grateful to you, my love for this night.~
@1042 = ~That is what I wanted to tell you, too, Ajantis.~
@1043 = ~*grin* Ajantis, considering what you did last night, I have to say you are taking your 'duties' very seriously.~
@1044 = ~Please tell me that you want to do it again as soon as possible!~
@1045 = ~Alas, Ajantis, your inexperience as a lover was all I felt.~
@1046 = ~I am very happy to hear you say  this. I hope it was as pleasant for you as it was for me.~
@1047 = ~It was. I start the day with the memory of this magnificent night, my knightly lover.~
@1048 = ~I want to do it again as soon as possible, Ajantis. Do you feel the same?~
@1049 = ~I will await the time of our next union in love with great eagerness.~
@1050 = ~*You cuddle up to Ajantis* Hmm, how about now?~
@1051 = ~I start the day with the memory of this magnificent night, my knightly lover.~
@1052 = ~You are... suddenly so close... ~
@1053 = ~Oh, my love, you are tempting me. Your warm body next to mine... No, do not let us give in to our desire. Let's get up, <CHARNAME>. Duty is calling, and a day is only as long as the gods made it.~
@1054 = ~*smile* Then let's get up. Duty is calling, beautiful lady.~
@1055 = ~I am surprised to hear so much anger in your voice, my love. What is wrong?~
@1056 = ~Nothing, only slept badly, I guess. *smiles wearily*~
@1057 = ~What is wrong with me? Nothing. It is your inexperience as a lover that is wrong.~
@1058 = ~<CHARNAME>! My 'inexperience as a lover'?!~
@1059 = ~I am sorry, Ajantis, I guess that was too harsh. Let's try it again, I am sure we will get there eventually.~
@1060 = ~On another hand, you are an eager learner, and I found pleasure in teaching. With time, I trust, this will cease to be the only satisfaction I derive from bedding you.~
@1061 = ~Yes, and it was horrible. Thank you, Sir paladin, but I never want to lie with you again.~
@1062 = ~Allow me to quote the ancient sages, clumsy boy: 'However expert a man might be in warfare, art and science, however accomplished, powerful and important, if he is scorned by women in the art of love, he is a dead man.'~
@1063 = ~I cannot believe that you are saying this! I accept your decision, <CHARNAME>, although it makes my heart bleed. By Helm! So let us break our deep personal bond and return to being nothing but fighting comrades. *sighs* I will stay at your side and support you on this campaign.~
@1064 = ~Although I am taken aback by your words, I am glad you see it that way, my love. *Ajantis kisses you on the cheek* I want you to enjoy being with me, and I am sorry if I could not please you last night. Now Let's get up. Duty is calling, as always.~
@1065 = ~*smile* That sounds like you've enjoyed it, my love. I hope it was as pleasant for you as it was for me.~
@1066 = ~It was. I start the day with the memory of this fantastic night, my knightly lover.~
@1067 = ~My love, we did not talk of this yet... I am very happy to have you as my beloved fiance. But before we can plan the wedding arrangements, there are some very important things that have to be done first.~
@1068 = ~Of course I... need to talk to my parents again. But that is not all I was referring to.~
@1069 = ~I am referring to the glorious task we are performing, the destruction of evil that is assailing these lands. Duties as a paladin do not allow me to linger. I cannot delay the search for the enemy, my love.~
@1070 = ~That's all right. Our wedding is too important for just squeezing it in between two battles.~
@1071 = ~I disagree. We are fighting very dangerous foes, Ajantis. One of us could fall any moment. I want us to marry as soon as possible.~
@1072 = ~What do you mean "linger"? I don't think our marriage would slow us down.~
@1073 = ~Ajantis, I thought about our engagement, and...~
@1074 = ~I have to admit I don't want to talk about this right now.~
@1075 = ~I am glad you see it that way. Yes, our wedding should be a precious moment to be shared with family and friends... It is too important to rush.~
@1076 = ~And in addition to that I have to admit that I would like to wait for my accolade. To marry you as a full knight of the Order is my intention, my love.~
@1077 = ~That sounds fabulous - yes, I can imagine the shiny armor you will don, my lovely knight.~
@1078 = ~Well, I think I can agree to that.~
@1079 = ~Does the Order really have so much impact on our private life?~
@1080 = ~No, that would be too long. Let's plan our wedding to take place as soon as the villains we are pursuing are defeated.~
@1081 = ~If this is going to be another discussion about your devotion to the Order of the Radiant Heart we can stop this conversation right here.~
@1082 = ~In your words I can hear your love, and that makes me very happy. Yet I do not think it would be feasible. I can not allow my private feelings to distract me from chasing down evil.~
@1083 = ~Maybe you are right. Our wedding is too important for just squeezing it in between two battles.~
@1084 = ~I don't see why our marriage would 'distract' you from our search in any way.~
@1085 = ~I have to admit I don't want to talk about this further.~
@1086 = ~*bitterly* Yes, you made what you think about my family quite clear already. I didn't pay enough attention then, being blinded by my feelings.~
@1087 = ~What are you trying to tell me, my love? Please, explain.~
@1088 = ~Ajantis, I love you, but I don't want to marry you.~
@1089 = ~I don't want to marry you, Ajantis. Our affair was great and I enjoyed it, but it's over.~
@1090 = ~I cannot believe we shall part like this! But you sound determined.~
@1091 = ~Are you telling me that you wish to end our relationship?~
@1092 = ~No, you don't understand. I just don't think it's necessary to marry. We could be together without it.~
@1093 = ~Yes. I think it is a mistake. I'm sorry, Ajantis, but that's my last word.~
@1094 = ~<CHARNAME>, I will never exclude my family from this very special event, and I have to try to get their consent beforehand. Please accept this fact.~
@1095 = ~Then I will accept it, Ajantis.~
@1096 = ~As you leave me no choice, I accept.~
@1097 = ~You are stubborn in everything you do. Forget what I said before - I do not wish to continue our relationship.~
@1098 = ~Be a couple but without a holy blessing?~
@1099 = ~Yes, without. Neither law nor Helm forbid a man and a woman to live together without being wed.~
@1100 = ~Precisely. I love you, Ajantis, but I don't want to be Lady Ilvastarr, wed to Lord Ajantis Ilvastarr of Waterdeep.~
@1101 = ~It makes me sad that we should part like this, my love. But what you suggested is not proper, not acceptable to me. It is exactly the Ilvastarr family tradition that imposes a marriage upon me with the woman I love. It has always been done like this.~
@1102 = ~But I did not propose to you just because of dogmas or traditions, <CHARNAME>. I want to marry you because it is the only true and lasting bond a man and a woman can have. I want to marry you because it is the expression of my deepest love and I wish for everlasting togetherness with you.~
@1103 = ~Now I understand... I'm sorry, Ajantis. I would like to marry you - if you still want to.~
@1104 = ~No, I can't accept this. I won't marry you, Ajantis. This is where our relationship ends.~
@1105 = ~*relieved* I am glad you say so, my love. Yes, I will be happy to call you my wife when the time has come. Let us plan the arrangements some other time. The celebration will be to your wishes, and you will not regret your decision. I will see to that.~
@1106 = ~I did not propose to you just because of dogmas or traditions, <CHARNAME>. I want to marry you because it is the only true and lasting bond a man and a woman can have. I want to marry you because it is the expression of my deepest love and I wish for everlasting togetherness with you.~
@1107 = ~No, I don't understand. It makes me sad that we should part like this, my love. But what you suggested is not proper, not acceptable to me. It is exactly the Ilvastarr family tradition that imposes a marriage upon me with the woman I love. It has always been done like this.~
@1108 = ~I hear you, and you sound determined. It makes me sad that I should lose you like this, my love, but you seem to have thought it through.~
@1109 = ~*sighs* Let's again be nothing to each-other but fighting comrades and concentrate on our duties. By Helm! I won't let anything distract my attention from my tasks from now on.~
@1110 = ~Not our marriage, my love - but our wedding, with all the preparations that would be necessary beforehand. Our wedding should be a precious moment to be shared with family and friends... If... I mean if my family will attend. *coughs* <CHARNAME>, I cannot marry you before I have talked to my parents.~
@1111 = ~In addition to that I have to admit that I would like to wait for my accolade. To marry you as a full knight of the Order is my intention, my love.~
@1112 = ~I disagree. We're living dangerously, fighting battles, Ajantis... One of us could be dead any minute. I want us to marry as soon as possible, with or without your family.~
@1113 = ~I don't need your family around on that day.~
@1114 = ~Then I will stop this conversation, my love, although we should discuss this at some time.~
@1115 = ~I am happy to hear that, although I wished we would be more in agreement. Let us plan the arrangements some other time. The celebration will be to your wishes, my love, and you will not regret your decision. I will see to that.~
@1116 = ~I will never exclude my family from this very special event, <CHARNAME>. Please accept this fact.~
@1117 = ~You are stubborn in everything you do. Forget what I said before - I want our relationship to end.~
@1118 = ~Not our marriage, my love - but our wedding, with all the preparations that would be necessary beforehand. Our wedding should be a precious moment to be shared with family and friends. It's too important to rush.~
@1119 = ~I disagree. We are fighting very dangerous battles, Ajantis... One of us could be dead any minute. I want us to marry as soon as possible, with or without your family.~
@1120 = ~Squire paladin, my love... Ah, I am sorry. I keep forgetting that you are saying this on purpose. *smile*~
@1121 = ~I wonder what you are going to call me after my accolade. Let us plan the wedding arrangements some other time.~
@1122 = ~Your words hurt me, my love. You knew from the start what the Order means to me, and this will not change in the future. I would suggest we talk about the wedding arrangements some other time.~
@1123 = ~I have the impression that you have a different opinion than me, but you are showing consideration for me and my plans, and I thank you for this.~
@1124 = ~Let us plan the arrangements some other time. The celebration will be to your wishes, my love, and you will not regret your decision. I will see to that.~
@1125 = ~That goes hand in hand, my love. As soon as we have finished our glorious task to stop the evil that is assailing the Sword Coast, I will have proven myself worthy of being knighted.~
@1126 = ~It would be... inappropriate to marry as a squire knight, <CHARNAME>. Not if the accolade is so near by. I hope you understand.~
@1127 = ~Let us plan the arrangements some other time. I am sure we will find an arrangement we both agree to and I will see to the fact that the celebration will be to your wishes, my love.~
@1128 = ~It does and it always will, my love. I made no secret of it. All I can do is assure you that you are the woman I love who brings sunshine into my heart.~
@1129 = ~I know you love me, I didn't doubt that. Besides, I can imagine the shiny armor you will don, my lovely knight...~
@1130 = ~Sweet. Well, I think I can agree with what you've said.~
@1131 = ~But I don't want to wait so long, Ajantis. Let's plan our wedding to take place as soon as the villains we are pursuing are defeated.~
@1132 = ~Whatever you say, the Order seems to be more important than me.~
@1133 = ~How can you say this? I spoke true words of love to you. However, do not expect me to turn my back on the purpose of my life, my fight for good and righteousness for you! If the love I give you is insufficient, we should reconsider our engagement.~
@1134 = ~Whoah, hold it, Ajantis. I didn't mean it that way. I love you, and I will accept your plans.~
@1135 = ~There's no need to waste any more time. Your words have opened my eyes. I want to end our relationship right now.~
@1136 = ~I am relieved to hear that, my love.~
@1137 = ~Let us plan the arrangements some other time. The celebration will be to your wishes, and you will not regret your decision. I will see to that. ~
@1138 = ~My eyes are on you very often, my love. *smile* They look upon the beautiful woman who is my betrothed. It still gives me moments of silent awe that I have met my wife-to-be on my travels. I... wasn't looking for a spouse.~
@1139 = ~No, I was definitely not on a search for my beloved. You captured my heart with your bravery and beauty, my love. It took me quite a while to understand my own feelings.~
@1140 = ~*smile* It's not that I didn't notice, Ajantis.~
@1141 = ~Yes, sometimes it's hard to tell one's own feelings.~
@1142 = ~Really? I thought you were quite straightforward. Not every man combines a love confession with a marriage proposal.~
@1143 = ~I was starting to think I would have to ask you myself, Ajantis...~
@1144 = ~Ajantis, I am sorry, but I don't want to talk about this now.~
@1145 = ~Ajantis, I've thought about it and have come to a conclusion. I don't want to marry you and I declare our engagement broken.~
@1146 = ~Ah... *with a shy smile* I guess, my actions showed a lack of experience in matters of the heart. It makes me all the more happy to know you are at my side now, my love.~
@1147 = ~They were completely new feelings for me, my love. It is gratifying to see that one can be enamored without risking moments of carelessness concerning one's duties.~
@1148 = ~This is the only way I can imagine it could be, my love.~
@1149 = ~When I finally realized what you've become to me, I had to wait for the consent of my family.~
@1150 = ~The letter I received was all I needed then. Now I am waiting to return to Waterdeep to have a conversation with my parents about this... *sighs* I would be so much happier if I gained my family's consent again. But it's of no use to talk about this now.~
@1151 = ~I had hoped you weren't watching when Douglas brought my parents' letter. I was afraid you would ask me about what he brought the whole day long. Fortunately the day left no possibility for such inquiries.~
@1152 = ~...so that you could surprise me with a marriage proposal.~
@1153 = ~It was a strange day, yes. But it had a very nice ending. *smile*~
@1154 = ~Ajantis, it was an irritating situation, and I felt then what I still feel now: I don't want you to keep any secrets from me.~
@1155 = ~I hope you did not feel insecure, my love. I did not mean to keep secrets from you. But in this case I wanted to make sure the timing was right.~
@1156 = ~I am sorry if it made you feel insecure, my love. I did not mean to keep secrets from you. But in this case I wanted to make sure the timing was right.~
@1157 = ~There might be times when I have information that I am not supposed to share with you, my love. But I assure you it is not my intent to keep any secrets from you. Please trust me, <CHARNAME>.~
@1158 = ~I am very happy I can call such an impressive woman mine. Let us walk the path of virtue and righteousness together, my love. Of course... If I say 'together,' it does not mean that we will never be apart. I serve the Order of the Radiant Heart, and it is very likely that my duties will lead me to battlefields and political missions all over the world...~
@1159 = ~Don't worry, Ajantis. Give me a kiss.~
@1160 = ~Ajantis, I don't see a problem. *smile*~
@1161 = ~Well, I am sure we will find a solution we will both be happy with, Ajantis.~
@1162 = ~I could become a member of the Order. Then we could travel together, just like now.~
@1163 = ~I guess it's idle talk at the moment. Time will tell, and sometimes things turn out differently  from what was planned.~
@1164 = ~Ajantis, I don't want to become a lonely and frustrated wife that hardly gets to see her husband at all. Can't you leave the Order?~
@1165 = ~That I will never do, my love. Do not ask this of me. I will never stop fighting against evil, <CHARNAME>.~
@1166 = ~Well, I guess I have to accept that. Do you think we will find a solution we will both be happy with, Ajantis?~
@1167 = ~No, this won't work, Ajantis. Let us declare our engagement broken.~
@1168 = ~If we always take care of each other and never forget what we feel now I am sure we will find a solution, my love.~
@1169 = ~Enough of these solemn words. Give me a kiss.~
@1170 = ~That is definitely true, Ajantis.~
@1171 = ~I guess you are right, Ajantis...~
@1172 = ~Only renowned knights can be mentors, <CHARNAME>. It will be a long time before I get to this honorable and responsible position. I am only a squire.~
@1173 = ~I know, my brave knight. Give me a kiss.~
@1174 = ~It will work out somehow, I guess.~
@1175 = ~*puts his arms around you* Let me hold you for a short moment before we go on. Know this: I will carry you in my heart, wherever I might be.~
@1176 = ~That is something I will do with pleasure, my love! *Ajantis puts his arms around you and kisses you tenderly.* Let me hold you for a short moment before we go on, <CHARNAME>! Know this: I will carry you in my heart, wherever I might be.~
@1177 = ~Did you change your opinion concerning joining the Order then?~
@1178 = ~That would be one possibility... And yet: Even if we are both knights of the Order that wouldn't necessarily mean we could spend all our time together. Also, you would spend your first years with your mentor, working for and learning from him or her.~
@1179 = ~*grins* Sounds good. How about you being my mentor?~
@1180 = ~There is truth in your words...~
@1181 = ~Then I will be quiet, my love, and stop distracting you from your tasks.~
@1182 = ~The confidence in your words makes me happy, <CHARNAME>.~
@1183 = ~You sound very determined. I will accept your decision, although it makes my heart bleed.~
@1184 = ~By Helm! So let us end our deep personal bond and return to being nothing but fighting comrades. *sighs* I will stay at your side and support you in our current fight.~
@1185 = ~Is this where we will rest for today? My gear needs mending... Will you stay awake for another moment, my love?~
@1186 = ~Yes, I will. Why do you ask?~
@1187 = ~Hmmm, Ajantis, I would like it better if your hands took care of me...~
@1188 = ~No, I want to sleep immediately. I am very tired.~
@1189 = ~I was thinking about coming to you after I have finished with my weapons. My desire for you is growing, my love.~
@1190 = ~You mean to give it another try tonight? *smile* Yes, that sounds good.~
@1191 = ~I will warm the blankets and wait with great longing, Ajantis...~
@1192 = ~Then I will be waiting for you.~
@1193 = ~I don't want to wait that long, Ajantis!~
@1194 = ~Ajantis, I am sorry, but I am too tired.~
@1195 = ~*smile* That is the reason why I was asking whether you will stay awake for another moment. My desire for you is growing, my love.~
@1196 = ~I will warm the blankets and wait with great longing, Ajantis.~
@1197 = ~<CHARNAME>, your words fill me with passion. I... I will finish the honing of my weapons as fast as possible. I will be with you soon, my love...~
@1198 = ~I am sorry, but I have to take care of my gear if I want it to function reliably, my love. If I don't do it now, I... will never do it tonight. *ahem* At least not if we will do what I hope we will...~
@1199 = ~*dramatic sigh* Then I will warm the blankets and wait with great longing, my brave knight.~
@1200 = ~It's all right, Ajantis. I will be awake.~
@1201 = ~No, I am too tired for that. Good night, Ajantis.~
@1202 = ~*with a faint sigh* Then I wish you a good night, my love. May your sleep be restful.~
@1203 = ~I am glad that you are not spurning me since you were disappointed by the first time we made love. *coughs*~
@1204 = ~*whispers* Are you awake, my love? I was looking at you for quite awhile now... You look even more beautiful in your sleep. Thank you for this night, <CHARNAME>. I am very happy to have you so close to me.~
@1205 = ~That was very nice, Ajantis. I love you.~
@1206 = ~*you put your arms around him* Hmm, enjoying closeness sounds good. Come here...~
@1207 = ~Thank you. Let's get up.~
@1208 = ~Thank you, Ajantis. I... enjoyed it very much, too.~
@1209 = ~Ajantis, this was just as bad as the first time. Maybe even worse for all your eagerness. Please, I think it will be for the best if we stop it altogether. I don't want to spend the nights of my life suffering the awkward thrusting of a clumsy lover.~
@1210 = ~*smiles warmly* Are you awake, my love? I was watching you for quite a while now... You look even more beautiful in your sleep. I am very happy to have you so close to me, <CHARNAME>.~
@1211 = ~I love you, too, <CHARNAME>.~
@1212 = ~I feel well rested now, Ajantis... How about enjoying some closeness? *you put your arms around him*~
@1213 = ~How about enjoying some more closeness? *you put your arms around him*~
@1214 = ~Let's get up.~
@1215 = ~You mean... right now? I am lying beside your warm body and I feel my desire rise... <CHARNAME>, that you cuddle up against me does *not* alleviate this condition. A day is only as long as... the gods...~
@1216 = ~Forget what I wanted to say. *He kisses you with shy eagerness* How much I desire you, my love!~
@1217 = ~Indeed! Let's start the day.~
@1218 = ~I am very happy and relieved to hear you say  this, my love.~
@1219 = ~I love you, Ajantis.~
@1220 = ~*you put your arms around him* Hmm, how about having another...~
@1221 = ~My love, you asked me how I would save you from a dragon once.~
@1222 = ~Yes, and I was very impressed by your answer, Ajantis. Not everyone has a squire knight of her very own to protect her. *smile*~
@1223 = ~Yes, I remember. What is it?~
@1224 = ~Oh, you still remember this? I was just curious how you men would resolve this situation.~
@1225 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>, although I was not too happy with my performance. Did you know that originally I did not want it to look humorous, my love? I had a very different poem in mind... I do not know why I did not recite it then. Maybe I was afraid it would show my feelings too obviously. Little did I hope to find myself at your side back then.~
@1226 = ~In all honesty, I was not entirely happy with my performance. Did you know that originally I did not want it to look humorous, my love? I had a very different poem in mind... I do not know why I did not recite it then. Maybe I was afraid it would show my feelings too obviously. Little did I hope to find myself at your side back then.~
@1227 = ~Yes, we solved it differently indeed. I was not too happy with my performance. Did you know that originally I did not want it to look humorous, my love? I had a very different poem in mind... I do not know why I did not recite it then. Maybe I was afraid it would show my feelings too obviously. Little did I hope to find myself at your side back then.~
@1228 = ~Please let me recite it for you now. It is from Sir Leontisk's "Stanzas on the Sight of the Golden Dragon Xzynathernolaquella".~
@1229 = ~O magnificent creature of grace and power
Your lightest step wakes a quake in my heart
Your swiftest glance holds a promise divine
Your softest breath kindles fires of love.

In my dreams you are soaring ever the highest,
The Queen of the Skies and the beckoning star.
I am sprouting wings getting ready to fly
And I stand here small, awestruck and in love.~
@1230 = ~That is the poem I wanted to present to you, my love.~
@1231 = ~That is a really beautiful love poem, Ajantis. Thank you.~
@1232 = ~I can't tell whether it is a love poem or not...~
@1233 = ~Well, let us hope this Sir Leontisk got lucky with his golden dragon.~
@1234 = ~I was holding my breath, but heh, good luck finding anything that rhymes with 'Xzynathernolaquella'!~
@1235 = ~I am very happy you like it. Every word is true when I look at you, my love. Written for a majestic creature it reflects my feelings for you, impressive, lovely <CHARNAME>.~
@1236 = ~It is. Every word is true when I look at you, my love. Written for a majestic creature it reflects my feelings for you, impressive, lovely <CHARNAME>.~
@1237 = ~I am not too sure about the relation between Lord Leontisk and the dragon. Even though I have the impression you did not like the poem, all I can say is that every word is true when I look at you, my love. Written for a majestic creature it reflects my feelings for you, impressive, lovely <CHARNAME>.~
@1238 = ~I trust your judgment on this matter, my love. You are a skillful bard.~
@1239 = ~That was an interesting love poem, Ajantis. Thank you!~
@1240 = ~One day I will write a song about you, beloved. When I find the words appropriate to describe your virtue, your loyalty, your kindness and your beauty. It might take all my life to seek out these words, but it will be a song worthy of you. I love you, my Ajantis.~
@1241 = ~You... you have just found all the words. Nothing honors me more than your love.~
@1242 = ~As for the poem I have recited, it was written for a majestic creature and it reflects my feelings for you, impressive, lovely <CHARNAME>.~
@1243 = ~What an evil place, full of the restless dead! This will be where we meet Sarevok, our foe from the start, in a gruesome fight. With him dead the giant conspiracy to instigate war on the Sword Coast will be destroyed.~
@1244 = ~With him dead, you would also have hunted down and killed the murderer of your foster father Gorion. How do you feel, my love?~
@1245 = ~I can't wait to face this villain and confront him with my accusations!~
@1246 = ~I am afraid, Ajantis. So much depends on our next step. What if we fail?~
@1247 = ~It's a pity it went that far. But it's not my fault, and now we have to end this.~
@1248 = ~Let's stop talking, Ajantis, and concentrate on the battle to be fought.~
@1249 = ~Yes, I can understand your desire for vengeance. Sarevok is truly evil and he has thrown your whole life into chaos with his selfish plans to gain the power of your dead Sire.~
@1250 = ~There is no need to be afraid of the final confrontation! Do not let yourself be weakened by doubt and fear. You are well prepared and you have loyal companions at your side!~
@1251 = ~We have to end it, indeed! We will stop Sarevok's selfish plans from coming to fruition. We shall not let him gain the power of your dead Sire, throwing yours and others' lives into chaos.~
@1252 = ~I agree that this is not the place for an idle conversation. Yet I have the feeling that there will not be much time left to talk later on, my love. We will soon fight the final battle, putting an end to Sarevok's selfish plans to gain the power of your dead Sire, while throwing yours and others' lives into havoc.~
@1253 = ~I expect it to be a desperately close battle, but the power of good will prevail! I will fight on your side with all my might, my love. If necessary, unto my own death.~
@1254 = ~We will see how well prepared he is, <CHARNAME>. I expect it to be a desperately close battle, but the power of good will prevail! I will fight on your side with all my might, my love. If necessary, until my own death.~
@1255 = ~Thank you. Your words are noble and selfless, Ajantis.~
@1256 = ~Anything else would have surprised me, to be honest.~
@1257 = ~We will see whether this will be necessary, Ajantis.~
@1258 = ~Yes, but let us stop the conversation now.~
@1259 = ~I am speaking these words as a paladin devoted to his duties... and as your husband to be, <CHARNAME>.~
@1260 = ~Just one more word, my love, before all our attention is given to our enemies.~
@1261 = ~When this is over, should I still be alive, I will travel back to my home and to the headquarters of the Order of the Radiant Heart, my love. My way will lead me to Waterdeep and to Amn. To Waterdeep, because my family lives there. To Amn, because that is where my mentor, Sir Keldorn Firecam, is stationed. I need to consult both because... because of the things we have talked of before. I hope that it will not be long before we can be reunited.~
@1262 = ~But for now, we have to concentrate on our fight. There is still a lot to do, and all our attention will be needed to turn this into a glorious, triumphant victory of good over evil!~
