@0    = ~My lady! I take it that you meant by those words that the presence of this man would be a helpful addition to the group?~
@1    = ~Keep your manners, man! You are talking to an honorable lady, so you'd better behave properly! There's no need to press your affections on <CHARNAME>!~
@2    = ~My lady, the words you addressed to this man Durlyle were rather... direct. If this is the way you prefer talking and... acting, I guess it is best I keep my thoughts to myself from now on.~
@3    = ~Let us move on and concentrate on our duties. By Helm! I won't let anything distract my attention from my tasks from now on.~
@4    = ~My love! The words you addressed to that man Durlyle were very... indiscreet. I am taken aback to hear you talking like that and... to another man. How should I interpret this? I thought we had a close and intimate relationship; that we were lovers - you accepted my proposal! Am I mistaken?~
@5    = ~I have to admit being somehow... fascinated by this man Durlyle, Ajantis.~
@6    = ~Uh, haha, Ajantis! I didn't notice you were so close by!~
@7    = ~You consider those words too direct? And what would have been your response had I addressed them to *you*, hmm?~
@8    = ~Ajantis, you are really sweet, but thinking about it, I'd prefer... a real man!~
@9    = ~Ah, now calm down. All I wanted was to startle that man a bit.~
@10   = ~"Somehow fascinated"?! You just offered him... I... I can't believe it! My love, I feel like I have been knocked off my feet!~
@11   = ~I am right here at your side, where I wanted to spend the rest of my life. And now I hear you talking like this... You just offered him... I... I can't believe it! My love, I feel like I have been knocked off my feet!~
@12   = ~"Too direct"?! You just offered him... I... I cannot believe it! My love, I feel like I have been knocked off my feet! This is not the way I wanted to talk to you... And it's definitely not the way I wanted to hear you talking to another man!~
@13   = ~What are you saying here?! Am I not a "real man"?! Were all the words we have exchanged so far only lies to you? My love, I feel like I have been knocked off my feet! This is not the way I wanted to talk to you... And it's definitely not the way I wanted to hear you talking about me!~
@14   = ~What are you saying here?! Am I not a "real man"?! I hardly recognize you, my love! Were all the words and... deeds we have exchanged so far only falsehoods to you? I... I confessed my love to you! We spent many intimate hours together! - I feel like I have been knocked off my feet!~
@15   = ~The one you startled was *me*, my love! You just offered him... I... I can't believe it! I feel like I have been knocked off my feet!~
@16   = ~I can't accept such behaviour! Our relationship ends here. Let's go back to being nothing but fighting comrades and concentrate on our duties. By Helm! I won't let anything distract my attention from my task from now on!~
@17   = ~The words you addressed to that man Durlyle seemed to be filled with some kind of warmth, my lady. You... seem to like him?~
@18   = ~Yes, although sympathy would be a better term. I think this Durlyle is a very interesting person, yet not in the way he seemed to understand it... I would have liked to keep him as a friend.~
@19   = ~Yes, I liked him quite a bit. More than that, to be precise. That's a man I could really grow fond of. *sighs* A pity he didn't want to come along.~
@20   = ~And why would that be any of your business?~
@21   = ~I... understand. Next time you meet him you should clarify this misunderstanding, though, otherwise he might try again to press his affections on you!~
@22   = ~Indeed. I... understand. Well, we can't always get what we would like to have. That's... true for all of us. *sighs*.~
@23   = ~Let's move on and concentrate on our duties, my lady. I won't pester you with my thoughts in the future.~
@24   = ~...~
@25   = ~Well, for no reason, I guess. You are right. I should keep my thoughts to myself from now on.~
@26   = ~Let's move on and concentrate on our duties. By Helm! I won't let anything distract my attention from my task from now on.~
@27   = ~The words you addressed to that man Durlyle seemed to be filled with some kind of warmth, my love. You... seem to like him, I had that impression. I am taken aback to hear you talking like that to another man. How should I interpret this? I thought we had a close and intimate relationship; that we were lovers. You accepted my proposal! Am I mistaken?~
@28   = ~Ajantis, I think this Durlyle is a very interesting person, and I like him very much. Yet not in the sense you mean - or he might have understood it. I would have liked to keep him as a friend, that's all. You are the man of my heart, and that won't be changed even by the most beautiful flowers or the sweetest courtesy!~
@29   = ~I have to admit I was more than fascinated by Durlyle. Maybe my feelings for you aren't as strong as I thought...~
@30   = ~All I did was a bit of flirting with another man. Did you feel uncomfortable with that, my love?~
@31   = ~So it seems! I thought our diversions up to now were quite pleasant, but there was nothing more to it, was there?~
@32   = ~My love, your words lighten my heart. Come into my arms so I may hold you for a moment. I feared, for a short time, to have lost you forever.~
@33   = ~My love, did the short encounter and the two errands for this man plant so much doubt into your heart? Please tell me your feelings for me are the same as before, that you are still my lovely bride... <CHARNAME>?~
@34   = ~Yes, I still love you and want to marry you, Ajantis.~
@35   = ~No, it is over, Ajantis. This small encounter opened my eyes.~
@36   = ~I did, indeed feel a bit uncomfortable with that, my love. You talked to him like you talk to... me! Please tell me your feelings for me are the same as before, that you are still my lovely bride... <CHARNAME>?~
@37   = ~Yes, I love you and want to marry you, Ajantis.~
@38   = ~"Diversions"?! I gave you my love... You are the woman of my heart, and I thought... you felt the same for me! Considering your words it seems I was mistaken. Our relationship ends here. My love, I cannot take this!~
@39   = ~"There was nothing more to it"?! ...I ...I gave you my love, and we spent intimate hours together! You call that "there was nothing more to it"?~
@40   = ~In this case our relationship will end here. My love, I cannot take this!~
@41   = ~Let's go back to being nothing but fighting comrades and concentrate on our duties. By Helm! I won't let anything distract my attention from my task from now on.~
@42   = ~My lady, I see you on the path of good, but I am not fully satisfied yet. If you are interested in my advice, we need to focus on doing good deeds and helping those in need we meet on our way.~
@43   = ~My love, we have been doing evil deeds! People are speaking your name with less respect than before. What happened to our path of good and righteousness? We have to turn back to the right path immediately!~
@44   = ~<CHARNAME>, I cannot agree with the way we are treating the people seeking our help. I see you making bad decisions and turning down pleas for aid. This is not the way we should behave on our glorious search!~
@45   = ~<CHARNAME>, you keep on walking on the wrong path! I cannot accept the way you treat people. I thought you were different, but it seems I was wrong. Duty tells me to draw against you. Defend yourself, as I will fight the evil that is in you!~
@46   = ~Ajantis turned hostile

Ajantis attacked me, saying he can't accept how I treat people. I had to kill him; he left me no choice.~
@47   = ~My lady, I... overheard that you were raised by Gorion, well known keeper of Candlekeep library, and that he was murdered by criminals. Let me express my deepest sorrow for your loss.~
@48   = ~Thank you for your kind words, Ajantis. Gorion was my father, and my mentor. I will not stop until I find the ones responsible for his murder!~
@49   = ~Gorion died while defending me... But, what makes it even worse, is the fact *I* was the one they were after, not Gorion.~
@50   = ~It's all right. Dwelling on it will not bring him back.~
@51   = ~Thank you, Ajantis. When they took Gorion from me... I am sorry, Ajantis. I cannot talk about this any longer. It is just too upsetting for me.~
@52   = ~Where exactly did you "overhear" this?~
@53   = ~Thank you, Ajantis. I would prefer not to talk about this.~
@54   = ~Ajantis, I don't need this kind of personal talk!~
@55   = ~My lady, I fully understand your feelings of grief and pain. But do not let your senses be overwhelmed by revenge and hate. You can only hope to hunt down these murderers if you are not blinded by hate and you do not let revenge affect your fighting prowess.~
@56   = ~You mean, our unknown enemy might have an interest in you?~
@57   = ~Maybe I am just being paranoid. Let us go and find these bandits. Whatever the future holds, it will be revealed in due time.~
@58   = ~Well, it seemed like it... But I don't have any idea why this should be, Ajantis.~
@59   = ~Well... "Hand over your ward and no one will be hurt. If you resist it shall be a waste of your life." That's what the armored figure said when it attacked us. That sure sounds like interest to me, Ajantis.~
@60   = ~Of course it will not, my lady...~
@61   = ~Of course, my lady. I am sorry to have upset you.~
@62   = ~That is very strange indeed, my lady.~
@63   = ~This, of course, is strong motivation for you to hunt down the bandits here on the Sword Coast, my lady. I can only confirm what I already said to you. Be assured of my assistance in this dangerous task. Let us proceed and find the murderers of your foster father!~
@64   = ~You were muttering in your sleep, my lady... I am sorry, I did not mean to sound intrusive.~
@65   = ~Thank you, Ajantis. When they took Gorion from me... I am sorry, Ajantis. I can not talk about this any longer. It is just too upsetting for me.~
@66   = ~Keep your nosey ears to yourself from now on, Ajantis. I don't need this kind of personal talk!~
@67   = ~Then I will keep my thoughts to myself from now on, my lady. Let us continue with our duty.~
@68   = ~Of course, my lady. I am sorry to have raised this sad issue.~
@69   = ~My lady... <CHARNAME>, is it really your wish to wear this strange belt, with it's... consequences? I hope you don't mind if I will address you as "my lady" nonetheless... But, forgive my direct words, I would prefer you get it removed as soon as possible.~
@70   = ~My love... <CHARNAME>, is it really your wish to wear this strange belt, with it's... consequences? How should I call you now, is "my lady" still appropriate? This is confusing me to no end... If I may say so, I would prefer you get it removed as soon as possible.~
@71   = ~Lady <CHARNAME>! It is good to see you again. Surely I can join you now?~
@72   = ~I am sorry, you will have to wait a bit longer, Ajantis.~
@73   = ~Yes, please do join.~
@74   = ~As you wish, <CHARNAME>. I shall wait.~
