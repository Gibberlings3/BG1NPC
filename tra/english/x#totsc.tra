@0    = ~The flimsy snakeling! You are the snake of the first water! Were it not belittling and dishonorable to chop you down over a man, you would lie in dregs and bloody tatters, crushed and writhing! Begone, and seek some other to becharm.~
@1    = ~You do not belong, and you do not understand. But I have left your mate alone. You must go now. Go.~
@2    = ~Wow, 500 for all that! If all the merchants were this cheap, people like me would be out of a job!~
@3    = ~People you like? I thinking you not so nice nice, perhaps.~
@4    = ~Oh, I uh, I just meant people who like to pay lotsa money for stuff...~
@5    = ~Keep an eye on you, I will! What say your friend on what I have <PRO_HIMHER> buy, eh?~
@6    = ~Eh? *whispering* Almost anyone from the Gate coulda told ya all that, <CHARNAME>...~
@7    = ~'Course we have, silly! I mean, who hasn't, right, <CHARNAME>? ~
@8    = ~Heh, I've always wanted to break into the League... but "small danger" is puttin' it mildly!~
@9    = ~Okay, so much danger, maybe. But gold for danger good, yes? ~
@10   = ~*whispering* He's hiding something, or I'm not Littleman's blessed daughter!~
@11   = ~We're... we're trapped here? But... but it's so c-cold...! ~
@12   = ~Heh, you can't have met many thieves.~
@13   = ~Hmm, now what do you mean by that, short one?~
@14   = ~Well, it's just that sometimes people'll never find what they seek, 'cos someone else already found it first!~
@15   = ~An interesting point, and one which bears more relevance to the situation that you know. Still, I would know your friend's answer to the original question.~
@16   = ~<CHARNAME>, you aren't seriously considering to help this evil creature by condemning an innocent soul! We should fight her, that will bring the only kind of freedom appropriate for such a creature from hell.~
@17   = ~<CHARNAME>, it is good you changed your mind. Now this evil creature will get what it deserves!~
@18   = ~Evil creature! Now you'll get what you deserve!~
@19   = ~You *did* it! You tricked that man to help that creature from hell! Even if this man was a scoundrel and thief, you have no right to condemn his soul! Your action was pure evil. Defend yourself!~
@20   = ~This is foolishness. Why can she not pick her own weeds?~
@21   = ~This is foolishness. Why can he not pick his own weeds?~
@22   = ~This one is quite bloodthirsty. Ah, it makes me long for home.~
@23   = ~A lovely wild flower... a tad too wild for my taste, but it seems that you have taken to her, <CHARNAME>...~
@24   = ~Please, kind sir, wait to discuss me at least until I am out of the earshot. It makes me uncomfortable.~
@25   = ~Such old-fashioned courtesy... in someone so green. It reminds me of tricky merchants who sometimes put false labels on new wine increasing its age. But it still tastes sour.~
@26   = ~His ilk never gets 'pleasured' with mere words, <CHARNAME>, I assure you.~
@27   = ~No pleasantries? Such restraint deserves a reward. You want a cloak? You'd get your cloak!~
@28   = ~You complain that *others* are sickly sweet? They must be a sight indeed!~
@29   = ~No, no! That was absolutely right! You *are* history.~
@30   = ~Wow! Just met you, and already he is trying to use you, sweetling!~
@31   = ~You are going to help this... this... fresh farmboy?!~
@32   = ~How utterly *yawns* exci-i-i-ting... Excuse me, while I take a nap.~
@33   = ~Now that we have learned the genealogy of this... stablehand, may we finally move away?~
@34   = ~I suspect that 'disappearing' would be too much to ask?~
@35   = ~Flattering? Inexplicable, I would say!~
@36   = ~Charming! Blushes like a maiden to boot!~
@37   = ~In my parts, men do not find flowers particularly alluring, or ask fair maidens to bring them a bunch. In my parts, men shower their beauties with blooms...~
@38   = ~Is he blind or just dumb? Did he miss the meadow you are carrying in your hands?~
@39   = ~Now, my poor fellow, do not just stand there! I gather there are not many maidens in these isolated parts, but the way you stare at <CHARNAME> is scandalous! Do close your mouth at least, pup, before you start drooling.~
@40   = ~Pup?! *scowls* I am grown up enough to challenge you over the bitch!~
@41   = ~Tsk, tsk... Nobo-~
@42   = ~*lunges forward*~
@43   = ~Fare thee well, beautiful lady... Perhaps... another time... no, another time, and things would be the same. Go with my thoughts, and please, be well. ~
@44   = ~Coran and Durlyle

Durlyle was interested in more than friendship, it seems. In fact he was so transparent, that Coran got really jealous. Durlyle ended up punching him right in the face. I feel... awkward.~
@45   = ~Thou want us to pay a blood debt to thee, Shandalar? Indeed, this is most humble and... revolting. Whilst it relieves mine conscience, I cannot believe that a simple task of retrieving a cloak is a sufficient payment for thy daughters' deaths. Art thou sending us to a deadly maze, wizard? But no matter. Thou named thy price, and we must pay.~
@46   = ~A diary is a commendable pastime for simpleminded. A mage of power and ambition would have ruled those creatures in a few years, let alone few centuries... (Flea-ridden as they are, they would make a decent conquering army.)~
@47   = ~When the cubs die before the wolves, the pack dies. Much as I am eager to drain young blood from this settlement and see its decline, I pity the cubs to die in the dwarven warrens. Let's find them, but if they did not learn the hatred towards built things and mechanical trinkets, I'll leave them to their own devices.~
@48   = ~Do you hate this place, then? ~
@49   = ~I do! I.. I need to go! ~
@50   = ~Do you hate every trap, every device and every stone of it? ~
@51   = ~YES! Yes, madam, please, let me GO! ~
@52   = ~The nightmares will torment you, unless you cleanse yourself of the foulness that you have imbibed, while foolishly wandering around here.~
@53   = ~Take your mother, Therella, come to the druid's grove and bow to Archdruid Aramande. He would impose a penalty and heal you.~
@54   = ~I... I will do as you say. Now I MUST run out of here... AHHHHHH! ~
@55   = ~It is the sign! GRRR! It is the sign! We must carry it back to the mainland and turn all the civilized weaklings into the true beasts! Woooo! Listen to me, <CHARNAME>! What destiny can be better?~
@56   = ~If those flowers are rare, how dare you to ask us to destroy them for the sake of your courting <CHARNAME>? Grr! Are you a fly, to need it for mating? ~
@57   = ~That... that was very rude, outsider. But it is <CHARNAME>'s words that matters to me, not yours.~
@58   = ~The Gibbering Twelve? Are you alright, sir?~
@59   = ~Now *that* is a sales pitch.~
@60   = ~Not the most eloquent of allies, but, oh my! He certainly does look as if he makes up for it physically.~
@61   = ~'Tis such a beautiful and terrible thing!~
@62   = ~I don't approve of such clandestine activities, but I guess sometimes you've got no choice.~
@63   = ~Those words shall be your last, fiend!~
@64   = ~He's completely mad!~
@65   = ~It does have a fearsome reputation...~
@66   = ~But, uh, fear not, lady! The situation is by no means hopeless!~
@67   = ~A handful of zombies? There was a time when I'd have been fearful of such a challenge, but I feel we're more than capable of that now! Right, <CHARNAME>?~
@68   = ~Char or no chat, you gets them dead, you gets the gold!~
@69   = ~I know that many druids choose this path to bring themselves even closer with Nature, but I would be much more comfortable with my regular shapeshifting powers! By Silvanus, we must reverse this curse, for I am certain that none of us wants to spend the rest of his days in wolf's skin. One way to reverse it would be to... kill the chieftain! Kill Kaishas! Quickly!~
@70   = ~It would appear he speaks of wolfweres. Let us be wary, then, for they are not only truly formidable in combat, but possess great cunning and will use guile against us.~
@71   = ~Gift? I would have called a gift, if you asked before bestowing it upon us. Wolves are proud and strong beasts, and there is no shame in having wolf-blood. By not giving us the choice, you had cursed us, Kaishas.~
@72   = ~Think of it as you will. You belong now. ~
@73   = ~<CHARNAME> did not betray <PRO_HISHER> father's memory. You are blinded by Sarevok's intrigues, sage.~
@74   = ~Here, doggie, doggie, doggie. Here, boy.~
@75   = ~Impressive in size to be sure, but you have to consider just how and why something that big could ever get down here... And I think I, for one, will prove adequate to any tests of wisdom. Say, who and what are you, anyway?~
@76   = ~Who and what are not questions that matter; or perhaps I do not know, or you would not understand the answers.~
@77   = ~That's fine. I don't make mistakes. Well, not often, anyhow.~
@78   = ~Say, what's the name? Actually, you probably shouldn't answer that question.~
@79   = ~I've often wondered that myself, actually.~
@80   = ~The Gibbering Twelve? What sort of name is that?~
@81   = ~Hey! Me, too.~
@82   = ~Well, he doesn't seem to have much upstairs, but I guess the same could be said for most of the other people I must associate with on a daily basis... Hey, no offence, guys.~
@83   = ~Ah, the old return-our-missing-comrade ploy. I do so love a good return-our-missing-comrade ploy.~
@84   = ~You will hate the moment your father plucked your mother, <CHARNAME>, if you don't quit ogling this milksop. *For emphasis, Shar-Teel cuffs you.*~
@85   = ~You... you... deserve this chit. Bugger off, <CHARNAME>.~
@86   = ~Tiax is not here to harm. He is simply marking this location on his map so that when he rules, his armies will sweep through these islands and absorb them into his empire!~
@87   = ~Who is Tiax, and why would armies wish to disturb those who belong? We do not wish to fight to you, or others who serve of you, but will, if you press us.~
@88   = ~Never mind Tiax. He doesn't speak for our group, and we do not wish to harm you.~
@89   = ~Tiax is a bit addled, but I hardly fear threats from a backwater village of slack-jawed yokels. Our business is our own.~
@90   = ~Don't worry about Tiax. We don't care about your village one way or the other. We've come for other reasons.~
@91   = ~Ha! Not the clumsiest proposition I have ever heard; though indeed just as hopeless as the rest.~
@92   = ~Ha! Not the clumsiest proposition I have ever heard; though indeed just as hopeless as the rest.~
@93   = ~Interesting, <CHARNAME>. On the one hand, these surfacers have been trapped, so must be hardly competent; on the other, their worthlessness means that, should they turn on us, we could easily dispatch them...~
@94   = ~In either case, I have never been a fan of either sculpture or heroes. Free them, then kill them, when they are no longer useful, and leave them to rot; that's what I would suggest.~
@95   = ~And it would not be wise to try and stop us, either.~
@96   = ~Grr... I advise you to go, outsider, and seek out Kaishas Gen.~
@97   = ~Foolish human, I could have told you that for nothing.~
@98   = ~Listening to this one's speech is like clawing one's eyes out. Eugh.~
@99   = ~Iblith.~
@100  = ~I would sooner drink urine than the swill you surfacers call ale...~
@101  = ~Is that so, missy? Perhaps others you travel with have more rounded tastes.~
@102  = ~A surface elf, *and* a Selunite. Iblith! He deserves to stay locked in here.~
@103  = ~I find your ways at least as barbaric of the surfacers on the mainland. And I alone, coming from a place of true culture, am fit to judge.~
@104  = ~Bad memories cloud your judgement. Good day to you.~
@105  = ~An early start to weed out the weak... An interesting people, these islanders.~
@106  = ~Quiet, midget.~
@107  = ~Careful, <CHARNAME>, that is no mere woman!~
@108  = ~Quiet, lady, and let the man sit and rest at my side. You can stay too, if you'd like.~
@109  = ~Look, this one can barely speak. Ha!~
@110  = ~A ludicrous suggestion.~
@111  = ~In my heart I dismissed love long ago... This spectre shall prove no more troublesome.~
@112  = ~Ambushed!~
@113  = ~A demon summoning? <CHARNAME>, we should flee! Leave these wretches to their doom!~
@114  = ~Or perhaps I should use Shar's divine powers to set them on you and just take your money?~
@115  = ~Please, ma'am, we're at the end of our tether! We're just common folk! The... the offer stands, and I pray you'll do the right thing.~
@116  = ~So, here we are, stranded on an iced speck in the middle of the ocean, with no food or proper shelter. Do you find it amusing, <CHARNAME>, that we are actually safer now than ever before? Or are you too busy planning how we should fight our way out of this safety, to our imminent doom?~
@117  = ~Gibbering Twelve - no, but the Gibbering Three might have...~
@118  = ~*sighs* I have a feeling that since the aforementioned ship is the only one available in this harbor, we are going to miss it... ~
@119  = ~What is Evereska, if not a larger Tower of Durlag? We cut ourselves away from the world, created traps and defenses - all illusions and phantoms of our own pride and short-sightedness... It is hopeless. My kin is doomed to die, just like Durlag's clan, and nothing shall save us.~
@120  = ~Oh, I know that under our current circumstances it is quite silly to gloat... But I cannot resist to point out that I have mentioned on a number of occasions that dreaded monsters are known to inhabit mysterious underground ruins... which you are so eager to stick your head into, <CHARNAME>. Now, thanks to your insatiable desire to see if flame burns, we are about to be put to death by a demon knight! Such an honor...~
@121  = ~Your mouth you shall close!~
@122  = ~And I have been looking for so long for an appropriate way to describe our misfortunate party... maid service to Death. Quite eloquent. A pity I will not live long enough to write it down in my “Account of the Journey to Suicide”.~
@123  = ~And why, O seller of suicides, should we use your services? We are perfectly equipped to get ourselves killed as it is. Unless, of course, our eager-to-die-bravely <CHARNAME> thinks that adding the feeling of false security might bring our demise faster.~
@124  = ~Just the fate I've been dreaming of all along - to guard a withered corpse for all eternity. Perhaps "no, thank you" would suffice? *sigh* I thought not.~
@125  = ~*sigh* Thank you very much. Doom is just what we have most missed in this, ah, cursed place.~
@1001 = ~Think about what you might be passing up!~
@1002 = ~Or you will!~
@1003 = ~What?~
@1004 = ~Begone!~
@1005 = ~Indeed, I will await your return.~
@1006 = ~It is good you welcome it.~
@1007 = ~Ha! Come fight!~
@1008 = ~Together, free...~
@1009 = ~Farewell.~
@1010 = ~This wardstone assures your passage.~
@1011 = ~At them!~
@1012 = ~You have found it.~
@2001 = ~Well, he doesn't seem to have much upstairs, but I guess the same could be said for most of the other people I must associate with on a daily basis... Hey, no offence, guys.~
@2002 = ~Not the most eloquent of allies, but, oh my! He certainly does look as if he makes up for it physically.~
@2003 = ~Turn enemies to mush!~
@2004 = ~It is the sign! GRRR! It is the sign! We must carry it back to the mainland and turn all the civilized weaklings into the true beasts! Woooo! Listen to me, <CHARNAME>! What destiny can be better?~
@2005 = ~I know that many druids choose this path to bring themselves even closer with Nature, but I would be much more comfortable with my regular shapeshifting powers!
